        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

        "transcript": "hey guys I'm dr. Mona GU Hara and welcome back to another episode of dear derm today we're going to talk all about rosacea [Music] so rest assured that I see rosacea patients every single day it is super super common so you are not alone but sometimes you may not think it's rosacea and patients come in and they say doctor Kihara I really sensitive skin when actually that's not what's going on but that doesn't mean we're not going to talk about it today I'm deer derm we're gonna dig in a little bit deeper and talk about the different kinds of rosacea and what skincare routine would be optimal for you if you think you have it [Music] rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that a lot of people associate with redness on the face but it can actually present itself in many different ways so let's get into that a little bit more so there's four different things that I kind of talk about my patience with and people can have any variation of that first trigger-based flushing so hotter spicy food red wine changes of emotion changes of temperature I hate to use the word both hormonal flushing and the face gets a little bit pink in the cheeks and then the flushing goes back down second is textural changes on the skin so acne bumps enlarged pores dryness easily irritated any of those things where the texture of your skin is noticeably different may actually be a component of rosacea and what's interesting is you actually may see these textural changes which kind of look like pimples around your chin nose and eyes third you may see broken capillaries little tiny broken blood vessels in the skin that actually leave the skin looking a little bit pink and red and somebody may think for example you've been sunburned or have a little blush on when actually you don't and then lastly ocular rosacea or rosacea around the eye that leaves the eye watery feeling a little bit gritty like you want to dig something out of there each one of these components of rosacea has a nuance treatment that your dermatologist may talk to you about that being said anyone with rosacea really should consider using a very gentle skin care routine on a daily basis [Music] when I talk to patients about what they should be using on their face in the context of rosacea the first would start with a very gentle hydrating cleanser no harsh soaps nothing that's foaming nothing that's drying because what that's gonna do is it's just gonna stoke the fire creating more redness second when it comes to exfoliation I recommend using a beta hydroxy acid like salicylic acid instead of an alpha hydroxy acid like glycolic acid why because it's a little less irritating and also it can help minimize the enlarged pores which often come along with the textural changes of rosacea moisturization is essential because patients with rosacea may note that they have particularly dry skin so I recommend looking for creams and lotions that have components like ceramides glycerin and hyaluronic acid lastly and probably most importantly is sun protection and ultraviolet protection because we know that UV light and heat can be a very big trigger for rosacea flares so I recommend to my patients that they never leave the house before applying a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher if you're interested in collagen building or fading down fine lines here are some of the ingredients that I like the Cuchillo is a plant-based ingredient that's been used in many other parts of the world to bring out radiance and glow and increase collagen production and it's extremely gentle on the skin also I really like a vitamin a derivative called ret and aldehyde which helps to build collagen but is a lot less inflammatory than other retinoids [Music] so here are some of the things that I recommend avoiding when you're applying makeup I wouldn't use the harsh bristly brushes this is a great place for the makeup sponge to blend in your foundation or to put on your concealer because they're a lot less irritating to the skin and may not bring out that redness that can be triggered by irritation on the skin I also recommend avoiding mechanical cleansing brushes and mechanical exfoliants because they can actually make you have more broken capillaries on the skin so I would just steer clear of those altogether and then the last thing I would say is just be overall very careful of what you're putting on the skin it kind of takes some examination before you buy a product just because it says natural or organic or plant-based doesn't mean it's great for the skin and it actually may be pro-inflammatory [Music] so here are some specific product lines that I like for rosacea for sunscreen I like the elta MD line they have a wonderful product called Alta clear that you can put on each morning before you leave the house and as the clear and the name connotes it blends in easily with any skin routine but it also has this little magic gem of niacinamide in it that helps to reduce inflammation so that's one of my fan favorites when it comes to rosacea products I also like this line called a vent which is in general which is very gentle on the skin for those of you interested in collagen production and decreasing fine line this product here which is active ingredient is retinaldehyde is a gem just use a pea-sized amount over the entire face to get your desired result now one of the tips and tricks I tell my patients is actually just to apply it to the periphery of the face not the central face because the outside of your face is where you'll have the least amount of inflammation from rosacea but most of those pesky little lines another product line I love which is from Spain is called isdon't you can find it locally here in the US and this in particular this line in particular called mell atonic is infused with the coochie all that plant-based derivative that we talked about and it's very gentle I really love this because it's a serum base and I can and I like that it's clear as you can see and I like that I could use it in the morning or at night giving me a little bit more flexibility in my routine so I actually use this on a regular basis because I myself had of a smidge of rosacea that's trigger based for my feet so when I get out of the shower my face is a little flushed and I just put on my mellow tonic [Music] now that you have the general skincare routine for rosacea let's talk about the specific treatments that I may recommend to my patients so first for trigger-based flushing and I know this is SuperDuper annoying what I usually recommend to avoid the triggers the second component of rosacea that we talked about which is the textural changes or the acne bumps that may occur around the mouth the nose or the eyes eye there are a lot of options for this there could be topical or oral antibiotics that can come in the form of creams or pills and those can significantly help to reduce those irritated inflamed papules that occur and many times that is what causes the most anxiety in cases of patients who have rosacea third for the broken capillaries on the face thank God for lasers because they really help to reduce and get rid of those little teeny-weeny capillaries that are creating the red and pink hue to the cheeks and lastly ocular rosacea which actually can be the trickiest one to treat and can come on and off for years your dermatologist may give you an oral antibiotic to subside some of the inflammation or even recommend gentle cleansers to place along the eyelid to get rid of some aback grit so I hope from this episode that you learned that there are different components to rosacea but also a lot of different treatment options so definitely get in to your dermatologist and definitely check out some of the products we recommended today thank you so much for watching this episode of dear derm don't forget to subscribe to well and good and leave any comments below you",

        "transcript": "hey guys it's rosacea awareness month so I thought it would be a great time to share what I'm doing with my skin over the course of a day given that I have a tendency to rosacea just like one in 10 of those of us who live in northern Europe now that means for me that I have a tendency to flush certainly if the room is too hot or I have a glass of red one which I do on occasion um or have particularly spicy food or even just fiddling with my skin a lot my skin will tend to become pink um I don't tend to get spots so much in the center of my face which is quite characteristic of papular pastation I'm more prone to the arotic type you might just kind of recognize your skin as being redness prone um so it's about knowing where you are on this kind of Continuum I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle it's definitely there I can see the little broken capillaries and every so often I'll have a little bit of laser with Dr ores to try to reduce those but I'm not too obsessive about it I think really for me what's important is that consistent daily skin care routine that manages that tendency in my skin I'm also aware of my tendency to break out I'm prone to blemishes in my lower face although a bit less now than I probably was um 5 or 10 years ago but I still consciously manag my skincare routine to reduce the risk of breaking out and then finally I'm concerned about fine lines and wrinkles you know especially around the eyes maybe a little bit of Less tness in the lower face so considering all those three things I have to be quite fussy with my skincare routine so I'm going to share with you what I do in a typical day as I do my morning routine so let's get into this we want to talk about cleansing activating hydrating and protecting but first a big no no from my skin is anything with fragrance my skin simply hates it and I put it down to probably years of testing products when judging Beauty Awards when you will have boxes upon boxes arrive at your doorstep and you have to get through a lot of product in a short space of time so that means if I want a more sensorial experience I have to scent the air so I am currently loving this newco water therapy which is actually a really gorgeous blend of Sandalwood one of my most favorite favorite ingredients um for scent comb Ed with Marine elements and sage and fur and it's a really lovely kind of nuzzy smell um so I will sprit the air away from my face and that just creates that feeling of something more luxurious my routine without putting my skin at risk right so first step cleanse I firmly believe if you get cleansing wrong you cannot get skin care right and that is doubly true if not more so for redness prone skin I am going to talk about Dr Sam's products in the video today and that is not because this is a blatant sales video this is because this is actually what I use on my skin and as a Founder if I didn't use my own products there might be a bit of an issue so don't come from me in the comments All right so Flawless cleans is the perfect cleanser for redness prone skin and blemish prone skin I formulated it specifically to meet those needs because those needs are terribly terribly common so that means no fragrance of course no skin clogging ingredients no essential oils nothing that doesn't need to be there to ensure that I cleanse my skin effectively but preserve that all important barrier function so I'm going to do one pump because this is my morning routine but if it was night time I would do two pumps to make sure I get everything off my skin so I'm going to do one pump for me with redness prone skin we want nothing rougher than fingertips all right so we don't want flannels we don't want brushes we just want skin on skin and if that means taking a bit longer and I firmly believe in a 60-second cleanse so be it I actually practice something called the physiological sigh which sounds a bit dramatic but it's an Andrew hubman technique that's thought to be the most calming kind of breath work that you can do which involves a deep breath in and a second little one which fully inflates all the lungs alv giving you essential oxygen important for skin and everything else and then a big long exhale which is very calming to the nervous system because it activates the Vegas no so I'm going to rinse that off with tepid not hot water hat skin dry don't rub now one thing I would just say is if my skin is very very sensitive or you're having an active flare up and you're getting maybe an outbreak of papules and postals and your barrias feels really dry you might want to try a cream cleanser in which case I would use the Lage p\u00e9 tarian Domo cleanser super gentle no fragrance kind of almost nothing so next step is to activate or in the case of red and spone skin I guess it's more of an anti-inflammatory thing so for me I use AIC acid in the morning so I do use brightly Serum with 10% AIC acid but what's nice about this formula is that because it's got four different actives it's quite multitasking very multitasking even so it's got puchol which is anti-inflammatory but also good for keeping pores clear calming breakouts improving pigmentation and fine mindes and wrinkles it really does almost everything that a retinoid that you're using at night will do but you can also use it in the daytime and you can use it on top of your retinoid as well for a supplementary effect it's got some es scorable glucoside in here now for me that is amazing because my skin has become quite intolerant to aloric acid which if you know a bit about product chemistry has to be formulated a low PH around 3.5 which is way below the Skin's 4.5 to 5 pH level still slightly acidic but alisic acid makes be very acidic and that can be irritating so for me it just makes me two pink two red and the scoro glucoside which is an Esther which becomes converted into aloric acid in his skin very easily is a g option and suits me better and then we have niacinamide barrier boosting pigmentation improving blemish calming which again really suits my skin so that concoction of actives together really does wonders to my redness prone aging concerned complexion now I'm going to do one pump and I'm going to do the 13 dot technique you really want the benefits all over not just on your trouble zones now of course alternatives to that include Fina on prescription which is 15% aalc acid you could use a more straightforward AIC acid from say the ordinary or polar's Choice um choose your aalc product according to your needs but for me I want as much bound for my buckers I can get I work that in everywhere I don't do that in my eye area because AIC acid doesn't really have a role in Fine Lines it doesn't have any impact on collagen that we know of now worth a quick mention I do use neutralizing gel from time to time I sometimes use it in my T-Zone particularly in the week before my period my Skin's a bit oily and I like the salicylic acid in here it's 2% for the occasional blemish and I find that whether it's a kind of more race typ bump I don't get them very often but it would tend to be more here and I have had one here recently it's quite a rare thing for me to get spot but if I do I find this works better for me um even than say benzil peroxide which can just be that bit more drying but does work well equally for some others so you kind of have to find your blemish Buster of choice so it might be Benzel peroxide and 2 and 1 half% is about as strong as you need to go or you might go 2% salicylic acid a little bit to the barrier and this is really moisturizing which means I don't get that dry cornflake patch after I've applied it so I can put concealer on the spot too but for nighttime all I would do is swap in AIC acid for something that's retinoid based now that's allowing my morning routine to take precedence in terms of the redness solution side of things whereas at nighttime I'm focusing more on the health and well-being of my dermal Matrix so that means a retinoid and if I'm a little more on the dry side I'll go nightly Pro and if I'm I don't know gearing up for something important maybe I'm filming in a week's time I'll go a little harder on the prescription side of things so this is a baji treso point not five I do think using a retinoid is really helpful because so many people who've got rosacea have also got evidence of premature aging I think retinoids at night just makes sense um but you have to calibrate it according to where your redness is at and if you're in an active flare up do not use a red oid stick to your anti-inflammatories so once my actives have fully absorbed in my skin is touched dry then I'll come on to moisturization and hydration so a fundamental step even for combination skin so 65% of us have combination skin it's normal for me usually it means just using a moisturizer according to how dry or not my cheeks are or whether or not I want in this case nide which is in Flawless moisturizer or saram which is moisturizer light now in my Oiler half of my cycle so after day 14 I tend to lean into moisturizer light um the camid are just lovely around the eyes but you know equally Flawless moisturizer I don't feel too strongly about it um this would probably give me a slightly better finished my makeup at the end of the day but i' would have to block my T-Zone a bit more so it's really swings and roundabouts using what you need when you need it and kind of becoming that expert of your own skin mastering your own skin skin knowing what it needs and when it needs it so today I'm going to do full fat Flawless Moisturizer in this luscious large size now and one pump is almost always enough for me we're just going to do you guessed it 13 dots I just find it such a helpful ritual and I almost default to it now it would never occur to me just to do that and put it all on without precision and you know I use my under my fourth finger for my my under eyee area and I really work it in cuz I want that nice smooth base with concealer application and then I'll just kind of lightly Glide it in elsewhere might do a little bit of massage it feels good get the knuckles in there and then you know work it around your upper lip just don't miss bits um and I find if you stick to doing one or two fingers with your application technique you get a more thorough layer of hydration to all the nooks and crannies and then when it comes to your makeup you just don't get those dry patches time care and consistency and I do the same amount on my neck direct my neck okay good final step is to protect and sunscreen is almost as important as your actives when it comes to managing redness prone skin and for me I'm a mineral sunscreen obsessive because it suits my skin so well and particularly with a little tint because it just helps mask redness so I've got a lot less to do with my Cosmetics so I'm going to go in with gosma tint one um good news on the gosma tint two front guys any day now it's only been 3 years so yeah and I'm going to be really generous with it and it's going to look a bit scary and then it'll look fine because that's what minimal sunscreen does all right so we're going to do two thin layers and I'm going to do a bit of flawless daily sunscreen on my neck which is untinted because life is too short to deal with tinted sunscreen on the neck and then I'm just going to do my neck a bit of flawless daily sunscreen in a pinch I can do without moisturizer on my neck and it's got some ni cinnamide in there which is such a great ingredient for my neck but it is just a great moisturizer as well so lovely shade that's face and neck protected and perfected so I just done my makeup of camera um I did film that so if you want to see it let me know in the comments and really I think you need to learn to master your skin I'm really passionate about that that kind of is the premise of the whole Dr Sam's brand is Know Thy skin know thyself Know Thy skin so I hope that seeing what I do to my skin in a typical day helps you build an effective skincare plan so you can enjoy the benefits of healthy glowing skin thanks for joining me guys see you again soon",

        "published_at": "2023-02-03T17:00:28Z",
        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "[Music] hello my name is dr sam ellis and i am a board certified dermatologist welcome to my bathroom in addition to practicing both medical and cosmetic dermatology in northern california i am also an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at uc davis and i'm a consultant for skin care companies and i help them develop products that are evidence-based tonight i am going to be taking you through my anti-aging skincare routine [Music] now a lot of people kind of bristle at the anti-aging term and what i mean is not that i don't want you to be getting older as a physician i i want to get older i want my patients to be getting older because the alternative is not great but you might not want your skin to look weathered or tired i want my skin to be plump and youthful and healthy and that is what this skincare routine is all about but in sort of a low maintenance streamlined way all right we've got the towel on the hair is back we are ready to rock and roll with a nighttime skincare routine a little bit of background about my skin is that it's not particularly oily it is not particularly dry it is somewhat sensitive because i have a skin condition called rosacea which makes me prone to redness and flushing especially with a glass of wine but i don't get the pimples that some people with rosacea do get which is really lucky for me but i do have to be mindful that some products do irritate my skin and that i'm a little bit more sun sensitive i also spent my whole life outside i'm from california i was a swimmer and i played water polo through college so i have a lot of sun damage that i have been working on for the past several years but that is also something that i'm trying to tackle in my nighttime skincare routine so the first step of any skincare routine in the evening is going to be cleansing your skin the whole point of this is to remove all of the junk and debris that have built up on your skin over the day maybe take off makeup or sunscreen not or sunscreen definitely sunscreen if you don't have sunscreen on your face we're gonna have a problem but you need something to take that all off because if that's just sitting on your skin while you sleep that's gonna clog your pores make you more prone to breakouts it's going to make your skin look dull so you need to cleanse that off and the other part of cleansing that's important is that it sets your skin up to absorb and interact with the next set of products that you're going to put on it i am a huge fan of the double cleanse and i feel like if you're watching this you probably know what a double cleanse is but for those who don't the double cleanse is basically a two-step cleansing process where you use a more oil-based cleanser to remove that top layer of debris that's on your skin and break up some of the product and then you use a second cleanser usually a water-based cleanser to wash that all away so today i am going to be using the clinique take the day off cleansing balm as my first cleansing step it's not waxy it's almost creamy but holds its shape and then as you put it into your hands you can see the warmth from the body just melts it all away but all that product is still sitting here and i'm going to massage it into my face and the whole point is to really just break up that product and you can start to see my tinted moisturizer coming off you can see that redness of my skin underneath but i like to see the redness because then i know that my makeup is getting removed so i usually will take this up onto my forehead in the eyebrows i usually grab a little bit more for my eyes i feel like breaking up the eye makeup is so important you don't want today's mascara to become tomorrow's eyeliner because if you've ever fallen asleep with your makeup on you know what i'm talking about and if you haven't then that probably made zero sense to you so i'm just massaging really gently and delicately around this i'm going over my eyelashes and really trying to press the product down and away in a second i'll peek and see what kind of scary mess i've created oh yeah that's good that's really good and so at this point everything's broken up i'm gonna get it wet i'll just get my fingers damp and then we do something called an emulsifying process where i add a little bit of water to the product and you can see it turns kind of white and creamy and that really helps with the cleansing that water grabs onto the product and the product grabs onto the dirt and oil and makeup and sunscreen and lotion that's on your face and now i'm going to dip down and cleanse see in a second got all of that cleansed off and now i'm ready for my second step of the double cleanse but you can see like i don't really have eye makeup on anymore you can start to see the texture and the color of my skin meaning that i feel confident that my makeup has been removed with that step for my second step i'm going to use the vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin i hope there's some still in here i use this a lot yeah we're good so this cleanser is sort of like a pearlescent gel i really like it i feel like i need a lather in my facial cleanser at least one of the steps i might have been brainwashed by the cosmetic industry i don't care to me this makes it feel like something is really happening i like this cleanser because it's sort of a no-nonsense it's not an exfoliating cleanser it's really just the purpose is to get your face clean so i just kind of massage it go down my neck normally i would do this stuff in the shower so usually i would do my cleansing balm emulsify it and then hop in the shower wash my face and body in the shower and then come back out and do the rest of my routine but if i take this into the shower this video is going to take on a whole nother life so this is all massaged in go over my eyelashes one more time make sure everything's really good drop back down it's going to rinse it off all right so the face has been cleansed and when i'm done cleansing my face i don't want it to feel dry or tight but i also don't want it to feel oily or particularly hydrated yet i just need it to feel ready to accept whatever i'm going to put on it next i feel like if your skin is feeling too dry or tight after you cleanse you might need to switch your cleanser either to one that has a lower ph so something in the five to six range sometimes a more basic cleanser that sits more at the seven to eight range and the ph can be more stripping for the skin and although some skin can handle that a lot of people can't and so that's one thing to look for in your cleanser if you're noticing you're feeling really dry the other thing is that you can look for ingredients like glycerin or shea butter in your cleanser because those are hydrating ingredients that can support your skin while you wash once i've cleansed i'm in the home stretch that is honestly the thing that takes the longest in my entire routine the next thing i'm going to do is put on my trusted tretinoin so this is a retinoid this is a prescription strength retinoid and you can see this tube is very well loved so well loved that i am worried about getting some out of the tube right now a little more all right we're good pea sized amount that's all you need it takes me a while to get through one of those tubes because that's all you need for your entire face so when i'm putting a retinoid on i do the dot method i think this is not new for any body but that helps me sort of distribute it but a little goes a really long way with this product i just put any extra that's on my fingertips kind of down my neck the neck skin is so much more sensitive than facial skin because it does not have the same density of hair and oil glands that the face has so it doesn't have the same repair abilities and so you have to be really careful with the neck because you go in with 0.05 tretinoin and you might be sorry the other thing i will sometimes use on my neck is like a retinol so a retinol is a not prescription strength retinoid it is something that's weaker than tretinoin because it has to be converted in the skin into retinoic acid it has to be converted into tretinoin and therefore in that conversion it gets weakened quite a bit and so sometimes i'll go in with that on my neck or even around my eyes i don't want to spend too much time talking about retinoids even though they are amazing because you could probably find a million excellent videos here that go into more detail but essentially retinoids are vitamin a derived compounds that are the best thing you can do to anti-age your skin in terms of product besides wearing sunscreen which is in a category and a class all on its own so retinoids which include things like retinol retinal adaptolene teseratine triferitine tretinoin they can be over the counter or prescription and they do it all they support collagen synthesis so they help you make new collagen which makes your skin bouncy and glowy and less saggy fewer fine lines fewer wrinkles they help break up pigmentation in the skin they support new vessel growth and a lot of people are like oh i don't want new vessels but deeper in the skin which can really make your skin glow the other thing that they can do is they can actually fight something called cellular atypia so as your body is exposed to more uv damage over your life the cells in your top layer of skin can start misbehaving and that's what leads to skin cancer so as part of a skin cancer prevention treatment i put a lot of my patients on a topical retinoid retinoids increase collagen synthesis so collagen is the protein in our skin that makes it look bouncy and glowy and in our mid-20s we lose one percent of our collagen in our skin per year which is devastating so how do we combat that using a retinoid is the best way and that is why it is a staple in my routine it will never leave my routine unless i was trying to get pregnant or if i was pregnant the reason for that is that these are vitamin a derived compounds and they have been shown when taken orally to cause birth defects so no anti-aging in the world is worth a birth defect a lot of people will caution about using retinoids when someone's breastfeeding i personally would have no problem using a retinoid while i'm breastfeeding i'm not worried about a birth defect at that point the baby is out so just don't put it on your nipples and you'll be fine so most nights i will use a retinoid maybe once or twice a week depending if i feel like my skin is looking dull or if i just want to like a little extra i will do an exfoliating step instead of my retinoid i never use a chemical exfoliator plus a retinoid in the same night that is too much and overkill but one of my favorite chemical exfoliants are these peel pads by skin better they are a combination of lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid and then their own proprietary retinoid blend but when you take one of these and you swipe it over your face you get the sting okay that's the sting that tells you something's going down on your skin in a positive way i would not recommend doing a retinoid and this in the routine unless you're used to it basically otherwise you're going to over exfoliate your skin you're going to over aggravate your skin but for me i've been using a retinoid for six or seven years at this point and i need another exfoliating agent to just get some of that dead skin cell layer off the top so i can have a true glow and doing a peel pad or some type of exfoliating step usually a chemical exfoliating step not a physical scrub is what i like to do in my routine to just give me a little glow next after my retinoid is on i go in with a moisturizer this is the la roche-posay tolerane ultra this is a super mild but very hydrating moisturizer this is like five pumps i want a lot okay this is super thick and creamy it's basically like a pumpable cream usually i tell patients creams come in jars they're thick like frosting this is just just below that it is the thickest lotion you can imagine and i i adore this now it's on the back well this is going to be really smooth tomorrow but i probably use four or five times more moisturizer than i do of a retinoid i want more of it oh it just feels so good i like this because it feels really nourishing and no matter how angry or upset or if my rosacea's flared or if i overdid it with my retinoid and my skin feeling temperamental this never ever stings and i really appreciate that about this product i also see a lot of patients in my clinic who have sensitive skin who have allergies to things like fragrance or certain preservatives and this product just doesn't have any of those so i always feel really confident recommending it to people with sensitive skin because i think they'll be successful the only time i might not use something this sick is someone who's really acne prone who has a ton of clogged pores because it does have a lot of moisturizing and occlusive ingredients in it but oh i love it feels so good all right so retinoid is on moisturizer is on that's it it's the one two punch i mean it's pretty darn simple i do use something called azelaic acid in the morning to help combat my rosacea and i use vitamin c and sunscreen but in the evening for anti-aging retinoid and moisturizer now i don't exclusively rely on my skin care to contribute to my anti-aging plan or goals i do use neuromodulators so botox in my face to help with fine lines and wrinkles and creasing that happens over time i also do a mild resurfacing laser a few times a year something called clear and brilliant which helps break up pigment in my skin and also supports collagen synthesis the last thing i do is something called pulse dye laser so pulse dye laser is a laser that targets redness and you're probably looking at me going well i can see redness in your face oh you you can't even imagine what it would look like without the laser okay uh these tools that we have in a dermatology office are not to help someone achieve true you know there's no such thing as perfect we're just trying to optimize make someone feel more confident you don't need to look like an instagram filter that's not even a realistic goal you just need to look like you and feel confident in your own skin and sometimes a little enhancement never hurts anybody but i just want to be totally just totally transparent and that i get support from in-office procedures and i don't exclusively rely on my skin care if you're someone that does bravo but if you're someone who doesn't bravo to round out my nighttime skincare routine we cannot neglect the lips oftentimes i'll actually put my moisturizer on over my lips as well just to start softening them and then i'll go in with something more occlusive so something with a more jelly like or vaseline texture to really lock everything in so i'm going to use my aquaphor oldie but a goodie as you can see that's like a pretty thick i mean it's 40 vaseline or petrolatum excuse me and so i'll just put that on my lips to get everything nice and hydrated the rest i rub on my cuticles so in a clinic day you know i see 20 to 35 patients in a day and i wash my hands probably a hundred times that's sadly not even an exaggeration and so my hands take a huge beating so part of my nighttime routine focuses on my hands so anytime i showed you any of these steps any leftover got rubbed down my neck on and onto the back of my hands and that's really important to me but now i've got my retinoid on my moisturizer on the skin has been properly cleansed the lips are feeling juicy i think i'm getting ready to go to bed that's it thank you so much for following along in my nighttime anti-aging low maintenance skincare routine i just wanted to show you that even as a dermatologist who has access to all of the things this is what i choose now just because that's what my routine is it doesn't mean that's what your routine has to be but you should know that you can work smarter not harder and that an effective skincare routine does not have to be extensive or expensive it can be if you want it to but it certainly doesn't have to be if you would like more skincare tips from me and just to follow me around the office see what the day in the life of a dermatologist is like hear me talk about dermatologic procedures and medical dermatology you should follow me on instagram my handle is super creative it's at dr samantha ellis i would love to see you there this has been a blast and a huge honor thank you so much for having me bye",

        "transcript": "if you struggle with sensitive skin and figuring out what products to use and how to incorporate them into your routine I have you covered I'm going to walk you through a simple effective nighttime skincare routine for sensitive [Music] skin if you're new here welcome I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified dermatologist in Northern California and I'm really here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if you enjoy that type of content give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel I wanted to take you through a sensitive skincare routine because it's just such a common issue that patients run into is having sensitive skin and not knowing like well what's safe for me to put on my skin what's going to cause me problems and one thing I tell my patients as a dermatologist is what sensitizes your skin and what your skin can't handle might be very different than what makes someone else's skin sensitive so these are General guidelines the products I've picked for you today are things that I think would get along with a wide variety of skin types but again you're always going to want to listen to your skin and if you try something that I recommend that does doesn't work for your skin get rid of it now two things I'll say before we delve in is one if you have insanely sensitive skin like everything you are putting on your skin is causing burning or itching or pain or a rash you need to see a dermatologist and if someone came into my clinic with those issues I would be trying to take their skincare routine essentially down to zero I call it putting you on a skincare diet where we are trying to eliminate all potential irritants and allergens from your routine and often times that routine is like a cleanser and maybe a moist moisturizer now with this routine it's a little more in-depth than that because I feel like people come to this channel because they want more than just like a cleanser and moisturizer in their routine you can certainly build off of that so I've picked some things that kind of honor an anti-aging routine that would be good for mature skin or skin that kind of breaks out so I have some other things in my routine that I'm offering up for you tonight but if you have truly super crazy sensitive skin like keep your routine minimal minimal minimal second thing is I have my own skincare brand prequel that is specifically designed with sensitive skin in mind I could make a whole bunch of different nighttime skincare routines for sensitive skin with prequel alone and I would be obsessed with them but I also think it's important to talk about other brands other products I am a skincare junkie I like things from more than just my brand and so I have tried to pick products that sort of venture outside of prequel for tonight's routine but if you do want a prequel only nighttime skincare routine let me know in the comments I will happily put that together for you all right enough chitchat I had a very long day in clinic today it's 10: p.m. and I have a long day in clinic tomorrow so let's do the nighttime skincare routine first step is we are going to cleanse we are going to take the day off I was in clinic all day it was a big surgery day for me so I was excising a lot of skin Cancers and I was wearing a mask and goggles most of the day so I don't have that much left on my face I have probably some tinted sunscreen left over from the morning some mascara but that's kind of all we're working with and one of my absolute favorite cleansers for sensitive skin and honestly just like favorite cleansers in general is the bioderma myell water I go through one of these bad boys probably once every four to 6 months and I just cracked open a new bottle like a week ago so she's fresh I particularly love this for sensitive skin because it has very few ingredients so very few things to potentially be sensitive to now if you have sensitive skin that doesn't mean you can't use products that have very long ingredient lists but if you're potentially trying to sus out if you have an allergy or an irritation reaction to something in one of your products if you're working with something that has you know 10 or fewer ingredients that does make that process a little easier iier this is also fragrance-free as will everything I talk about today be not that I want to demonize fragrance but there are a lot of people that have sensitivities to it or it can make you sensitive to other things in your products so why not just like take it out of the equation if you're not familiar with my Celler water I'm just shaking it up to make sure it's an even distribution you can kind of think of it like a makeup remover gentle cleanser all in one I like to put it on a cotton round so I will saturate a cotton round with it and then I will essentially just like gently swipe it over my face if you have sensitive skin you don't want to put a lot of pressure because even though this is gentle cotton like it still exfoliates your face it still has those rough fibers so you just want to be so gentle with how you handle your skin but I swipe this over my entire face I will also take this down my neck because I have sunscreen on my neck usually I'll be hopping in the shower for a body shower but that didn't lend itself well to this style of video then I even go down like into the cleav just like get it all off and then once I do a first pass you can see there's my tinted sunscreen left over I will do another round so I'm saturating another pad and this time I'm going to do my eye makeup a lot of times I get asked is my cellar water good enough to take off eye makeup and it really depends which one but this bioderma one is exceptional I like to kind of press it over my eyes like a pirate and I'll usually let that sit there for 10 or 15 seconds before I then swipe it away and start to take that off but you can already see like it's breaking down my makeup pretty quickly same thing on this side I like to let it marinate for a good 10 15 seconds that allows the mellar water to start breaking down the product and that way you're not putting as much friction or irritation around your eyes oh wow this is when my husband chooses to run the dishwasher great great great and then I just do like one last check around the periphery of my face I find so many people are bad about cleansing the periphery of their face especially if they do it in the shower like if you're not washing your hair and your shower cap is of like AB budding this area it gets poorly cleansed so I just do like one extra pass to make sure we are really working with clean refreshed skin and now here's the cool thing about my cellar water you don't have to rinse it off and that can be your only cleanse like I feel very confident that that has taken off all of the stuff I had on my face out of habit and probably just out of like compulsion I am going to Splash a little bit of water on my face but you really can just leave it on your skin now if you have really sensitive skin it's not going to hurt to do a little rinse afterward but you can also think of my cellar water as like the most dilute gentle cleanser ever so it truly doesn't need to be washed off but alas I can't help myself I am just going to put a little water on I will gently Pat my face dry and then we can move on I just realized I do have a prequel product in this routine okay but just one I gosh I like couldn't help myself um this is the prequel Universal skin solution it is hypochlorous acid if you don't know what hypoc chlorus acid is I have an entire YouTube video about it that you can watch but it's like a very gentle refresher for the skin it's antimicrobial it's anti-inflammatory it's what I use every day in my own Clinic to prepare my patient skin for procedures so it helps cleanse the skin and what I found is sometimes people who have very sensitive skin have like lowgrade irritation going on from their environment or they have an unusual microbiome so the bacteria and fungi and viruses that sit on their skin sensitize it and so using something like hypoc chloris acid in your routine can be so helpful I love this one in particular because the Mist is just so beautifully fine I often will use this after I work out but it's also so gorgeous in a nighttime skincare routine and it's so refreshing we launched this product over a year ago now and since then so many of my patients have come in and said that this like truly saved their skin whether they were dealing with like perioral dermatitis or a little eczema patch people put this on bug bites and just like random rashes I don't know if you've ever seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding where like Windex is the Cur all the number of patients who have made that analogy to the prequel hypoc chlorus acid is actually hilarious now my cleanse is officially over I could just go in with a moisturizer here and be done but I also wanted to pick out a couple of things that I think are really nice for anti-aging and just sort of like smoothing out the skin that can be nice things to use if you have sensitive skin now anytime you're using any Anti-aging products in your nighttime skincare routine we generally refer to these as actives because they are actively asking your skin to do something or signaling your skin to do something in theory any of these could cause irritation but one thing I like to do before I apply those and what I recommend to my patients who have sensitive skin is I have them apply a little bit of a buffer onto their skin before they go in so that often is in the form of plain old Vaseline on the lips of course you can use other things on the lips as well but Vaseline is one ingredient so if you have very sensitive skin or you find that your lips are always chapped or peeled you're not going to be sensitive to Vaseline and I'm going to talk about two different anti-aging skin resurfacing products tonight and I wouldn't use these in the same routine I'm going to do half on one side of my face and half on the other obviously not what I would recommend to you but I want to show you the textures of both of these one of these is a retinoid product so retinoids are things like prescription tretinoin retinol retin aldhy they are vitamin A derived molecules that have been shown to help with things like lines and wrinkles they stimulate collagen they help even out pigment they are just such great anti-aging ingredients to have Incorporated and it's one of the things I recommend to basically all of my patients if they care about that stuff however retinoids are notoriously irritating to the skin and can cause a lot of dryness and peeling and that often doesn't last forever but it can be quite a long acclimation period somewhere between like weeks and several months so the one I'm sharing tonight is just exceptional because I find that you can acclimate to it quite quickly but it's also very very effective and that is the medicate Crystal retinal one so it is a retinal deide product so that's a step up in potency and efficacy from retinol which most people are familiar with but it's level one and this goes all the way up to level 20 and that's something I really like about medicate is that they create their retinoids in sort of gradients so you can start with something less potent if you have sensitive skin or you're a beginner and then you can work your way up as you tolerate it also retin alahh is traditionally kind of tricky to formulate with it's hard to keep it stable and effective but medicate has a great technology approach to this and their products with Ral theide are wonderful I'm just going to put this on half my face cuz I'm going to show you the other one on the other half of my face but it's nice and creamy you just need like really thin layer I would say one pump for your entire face but I also really like this because you can use it on your neck a lot of people can't use prescription retinoids on their neck cuz it's too irritating but this one's fantastic so I'm going to take that all the way down down even on the chest on the hands too why not let's go crazy once someone with sensitive skin is able to tolerate this every single night on their skin without issues then they could go up to the next strength aside from aroid I'm also going to show you an exfoliant that I really like for sensitive skin I would certainly not apply a retinoid and an exfoliant in the same nighttime skincare routine but a lot of people like to do a retinoid most nights of the week and then maybe incorporate an exfoliant on one to two nights just to kind of help clear the skin a little bit faster if you're blemish prone acne prone sometimes that can really help with texture and often times exfoliating acids work a bit faster than retinoids so it can be a nice thing to incorporate into your routine once in a while if you have sensitive skin I would consider exfoliants like a nice to have but not a must have if I had to prioritize retinoids versus exfoliants to Me retinoids overall do more for your skin so if you can only tolerate one of those things in your routine go with the retinoid and an exfoliant I really like for sensitive skin this is actually my second bottle is from peels it has a long name though it's clearly corrective daily retexturizing triple acid peel and it has daily in the title I personally would not use this daily but I think that's probably why it's great for sensitive skin it's because it's gentle they've designed it to be used daily for some skin types I think if you have sensitive skin one to two nights a week would be perfect I'll show you the texture of this on the other half of my face what a sacrifice I would never use these in the same routine like I said I'm just want to repeat that I'm using it on the side of my face that I did not put the retin alides but it's very liquidy and this has salicylic acid glycolic acid and lactic acid so a gentle blend of alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids and I'd probably do maybe like five to six drops for the full face I wanted to give this option because not everyone can use retinoid so for example if you're pregnant or you're trying to conceive you shouldn't use a retinoid but I personally am completely fine with my patients using exfoliating acids during that period in their life um and the thing I love about this is there's no sting sometimes you put an acid on you're like oh dang that's spicy there's no spice to this and I actually really like that exfoliating acids are really nice for adding a little bit of glow to the skin they can help with hyperpigmentation and they can help fade dark spots faster they can also help with congested pores so lots of good benefits to exfoliants but again if you have sensitive skin sometimes it's hard to find one that works but I really like this one so at this point we've cleansed our face we've protected our lips we've applied our active the last step in this sensitive skincare nighttime routine is moisturizer and the moisturizer I am showing you guys tonight and I've never talked about this brand before on my channel I don't think is by vetted Derm lab it is their M2 Rich moisturizer so this is actually a skincare brand developed by some of my Dermatology colleagues and I think the whole point of their brand was to create products that don't have a lot of the common ingredients that people can be sensitive or allergic to so when I have a patient who I suspect has something called allergic cont dermatitis meaning I think their skin is coming in contact with something that is inducing a skin allergy and especially if I think it's something that's in their skincare I will recommend a product like this because it doesn't have a lot of the common things that people can be sensitive to and that's not to say this is perfect there are ingredients in here any product that has ingredients in theory could be sensitizing to some people but I find that this tends to be quite well tolerated and this is just like a really nice rich creamy moisturizer I think they have another one called M1 that's more of like a daytime lightweight but I find that a lot of my patients uh either have mature skin or they're like seeking out something with more hydration so this is really nice for that I have a little bit of a problem with how they Market uh their products because it's a lot of like talking about Clean Skin Care and that really doesn't mean anything but I also understand it from like a dermatologist perspective because people are going to be seeking out their types of products if there may be looking for non-toxic skincare or clean skincare which again like any skincare could be clean or non-toxic what they're really trying to communicate is that their products don't have stuff that a lot of people may be allergic to so it's really good for like allergenic skin that feels lovely I believe this vetted Derm lab also has a cleanser and a vitamin C and maybe a retinoid as well so if this kind of thing is kind of interesting to you or you find that you have a lot of skin allergies check them out and of course everything I talked about and used in today's routine will be linked in the description box but that is all for this nighttime sens sensitive skincare routine I hope you found it helpful I'm so curious if you've tried any of these products but also if you like have sensitive skin and you've tried stuff that works really well for you definitely put it in the comments I really like to talk about sensitive skin it deserves a platform and your comments help other people that explore this channel so thank you so much for being here don't forget to like this video And subscribe to the channel and I'll catch you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "foreign board certified dermatologist welcome to my channel thank you so much for your support thank you for your support on Tick Tock as well we're nearing 1 million friends there thank you for the top doctor Awards Seattle met magazine and Castle Connolly it's been a great year and so I'm really excited to see what 2023 has for all of us and cheers to more fun thank you guys and today is going to be a video I might say rosacea on the title or on the thumbnail but really this is for all of those people out there with sensitive skin including myself during the winter my skin tend to be more sensitive I wouldn't say in general I have sensitive skin but skin types do flip around with the weather you know there's normal oily dry combination sensitive skin types sensitive skin though I definitely do find is something they can flip around based on the weather and definitely in the winter time where we have cold weather you have the heaters on overnight you can wake up with really dry chapped lips and I get irritation around my cheekbones where it gets pretty red and noticeable during the day and how do we hide redness what products do we reach for when we have irritated skin so it's not just for rosacea today it's for those with sensitive skin and when we have irritation a lot of times we panic and we reach for whatever's on our bathroom counter we kind of overdo it and we get into this whole vicious cycle of the redness worsening and so we're gonna go over some gentle products today that you can consider now rosacea let's talk about rosacea if you have rosacea I see this on a daily basis in clinic and it's a chronic inflammatory skin condition where you get redness on your face flushing and you can also get acne rosacea where you get these acneoform red papules or bumps on your face usually around the nose inner cheeks the chin and it flares with stress alcohol sunlight for sure heat so a hot shower taking something hot out of the oven getting that blast of hot air in your face can really trigger whether it's redness and flushing or red bumps and there are different types of rosacea like postula rosacea rhinophymodus rosacea where you get the red nose with bulbous like changes where you have really enlarged oil glands that can be tough to treat and also deep rosacea called granulomatous rosacea so they're different types of rosacea but in general when you have rosacea you're already put into the ultra sensitive bucket in 2020 I saw a lot of people with rosacea having flares of the rosacea because they were on Tick Tock and they saw a popular Korean sheet mask and so people were using it and they got really bad irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from using a sheet mask so be very careful with your new products always start one product at a time about two weeks apart and if you want to spot test on your neck or a small area of your face first I'm all for that if you have rosacea and a lot of people with rosacea can't do those anti-aging skin care ingredients we talk about including vitamin C or ascorbic acid so I always say 10 is kind of like what you're looking for for ascorbic acid going to 15 or more will really increase your risk of irritation La Roche Posay has a lower than 10 percent ascorbic acid they're C cream this is the one that has five percent ascorbic acid metal Castle side and also neurosensing which is soothing as well well especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin and the other ingredient that's notorious for causing acne rosacea flares or rosacea flares would be retinol or retinoids things I prescribed especially the stronger stuff tretino and tazeratine can irritate rosacea and a lot of my patients or rosacea we can't do chemical peels on them because their skin is so sensitive chemical peel what the acids could bring on a flare if you want to use a retinoid I would recommend an over-the-counter retinol that is less potent than the stuff I would prescribe and what can we use for that one good product I like to talk about a lot on this channel is Olay retinol retinol 24 is a nice formulation because it has glycerin it has niacinamide and I like niacinamide combined with my sunscreens cleansers moisturizers and retinol that is anti-inflammatory great for those with acne or rosacea prone skin because it also regulates sebum production and helps with inflammation so it won't clog you up and cause a flare this is a very gentle retinol I would recommend either the max or the retinol 24 plus peptide OG one without the max the max is 20 percent more of their High hydration complex which means maybe more glycerin more niacinamide I don't think it has more retinol I can't tell by the labeling on the website and they don't disclose their retinol percentage either other one that's a little bit more pricey than this because Costco has the OG in a two pack for a great price go for something more expensive like Keels I like this brand a lot this is their micro dose retinol whereas their fast relief is a higher percentage this one here is 0.2 percent and much lower strength so if you're a beginner this is a great one but you also get some additional anti-aging benefits from the peptide in this topical peptides are great because they're self-signaling and they help increase collagen production through cell signaling so I like this one a lot one pump gives you that yellow retinol pea sides amount and you just use that to your entire face so that's a really nice retinol that's gentle now if you can't tolerate any retinol another thing you can consider that's anti-aging would be Heparin sulfate containing product like sente this is nice because this also has cell signaling capabilities increase College gent this is very gentle nice for those with rosacea and they can't use a retinol this is a good option but also an expensive brand but I say worth the price very gentle one pump gives you what you need for your face it comes out as a nice moisturizing cream a little thicker texture there soothing and also effective as well so I like that brand a lot they also came out with a new pigment correction kind of a mask you leave on for 15 minutes I have to review and I'm gonna try to get my hands on to that one but that one's also like 150 bucks for that I know some of you have asked to review that when I release my melasma video so I'm going to look into the brand sentence pigment corrector mask okay now going on to daily routine besides anti-aging what can you do I say have a gentle cleanser you don't have to go crazy with exfoliants lhas ahas bhas and your cleansers I think something gentle like vanic cream vanicream's a king when it comes to sensitive skin care and so their cleanser is great I love their daily facial moisturizers awesome so affordable you can find that Target your local drugstore or online on Amazon and so it's a great brand so reliable I even use that for my kids I use that as like a body wash for my kids and you can use this as a body wash as well their facial cleansers CeraVe is a good one they're hydrating facial cleanser and the winter time is also a great pick lasts forever get the big value size at Target or online and it lasts forever now if you wanted to talk about anti-aging and moisturizers and you can't do the retinol peptide moisturizers topical peptides like we talked about have self-signaling and so we mentioned that with the Keels retinol has peptide and also I forgot to mention Olay has the pomatoil pentapeptide four peptide complex which is also anti-aging the peptide moisturizer by the inkulus just do a little pump there and you can dispense the cream skin fix is another nice brand you can get at Sephora this is their triple lipid peptide cream which is also nice that I've used quite a bit also dispense by pushing on this and gets the cream out very good for sensitive skin now if you have irritation like myself around the cheekbones and you want to sue that I'm all about petrolatum based ointments and this is a small cute mini version of what you get as a tube CeraVe healing ointment and you just put just a small amount around your cheekbones at bedtime so that you don't wake up with a red face or redness on the cheekbones and that's my routine at night but right before I go to sleep get a good fresh layer of ointment over it whether it's Vaseline Aquaphor CeraVe healing ointment I love them all if you have a lanolin alcohol sensitivity or allergy stick with Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment Aquaphor has lanolin in it but it's quite a rare sensitivity or allergy so most people tolerate Aquaphor just fine another thing you can consider would be La Roche Posay secoplast bomb B5 this one has a B5 plus because I got this in Europe when I was in Paris but this is a great product you can get at your store but it has been selling out people on Tick Tock are using this on their acne lesions because it helps with wound healing but the ingredients in this don't actively fight acne it's more for healing has glycerin panthenol shea butter very soothing doesn't irritate my skin comes out as this paste you can put a small amount around your your cheekbones here you can layer it with your Aquaphor you can put this on first in Aquaphor Vaseline or CeraVe healing women over it but you see how it comes out as like this white paste but it does rub in well and then you get this kind of dewy finish here so totally fine to plan your face not comedogenic at all I like this one a lot this is a staple in my household ever since I discovered this let's talk about the most important thing sunscreen because sunlight will trigger acne rosacea flares and it's not good for those with sensitive skin because UV radiation will break your Skin Barrier up and make you more susceptible to allergens irritants and such I've talked about ltmd UV clear quite a bit on the channel this is nice because it has niacinamide in it and I like niacinamide containing sunscreens for those with rosacea and acne prone skin because it helps with the sebum but also inflammation comes in the tinted and non-tinted form tinted is great if you have hyperpigmentation as well this has zinc oxide and oxanoxate this is about 36 to 40 bucks though for 1.7 fluid ounces if you want a dupe something cheaper there's Dermatology this brand I've also talked about on the channel this is a Universal tinted moisturizer which is the dupe of the tinted Delta MD they're both SPF 46 they both have niacinamide this one though is a little over 20 bucks so much cheaper than this one and also 1.7 fluid ounces and comes out very nice lightweight one of my favorite sunscreens out so I'll just put a little bit here just to show you that it's a lighter tint very lightweight that it won't stain the inside of your mask as readily as the other tinted sunscreens out there very soothing good for sensitive skin moisturizing as well has some hyaluronic acid to help hydrate so I like this one a lot now in terms of other sunscreens besides tint you want to hide redness because this can help how you redness pretty well these lighter tinted sunscreens you can go for a Green Tinted sunscreen like Dr jar Dr jart sico pearline they have the color correcting cream with SPF or their tiger grass camel drops with SPF 44 this one's really nice almost looks like a matcha colored sunscreen here guess I'm running out but it's a nice one it's good to have Green Tinted products when you have rosacea because the green will help mask your read very well and you don't look green you don't look like the Hulk after it rubs in really well and hides so if you get a little redness around your nose you can put that sunscreen there Dr jard is a little bit more expensive but I say it's totally worth the price you got the zika in it which is soothing anti-inflammatory zika's really taken off recently and this is like K Beauty brand especially in the K Beauty World cintella asiatica has really taken off and it's very soothing so great for those with rosacea I'd say wear your sunscreen every day reapply especially if you're Outdoors reapply every couple hours if you're gonna get sweaty or exercise jump in the pool any kind of water activity you want to reapply every 40 to 60 minutes because your sunscreen will wash off pretty readily even if it's water resistant you got to reapply quite frequently if you're indoors and you're not by any window just wear your sunscreen in the morning before leaving the household and that should last you for the day if you are by a window glass though you should be technically reapplying every couple of hours because UVA will still come through the window glass and deactivate your sunscreen within a couple of hours okay so I hope this video helpful I had a lot of fun talking to you guys again about skin care and things you can do at home before you see me because a lot of times we have to prescribe prescription topical medicines or even oral medications for acne rosacea or rosacea and sometimes even do v-beam or pulse die laser for the redness the broken blood vessels we call pelandictasias see your dermatologist to talk about how to layer your prescription medicines and what medicines could work with your skin care products because we want them to interact and cause irritation as you know like we talked about it's a chronic condition without a cure so it's an ongoing battle and sometimes it's trial and error and azelic acid might work for one person and it might not work for the other patient so taking things slow trial and error being patient and not adding too many things at once taking things one step at a time okay so please hit the like button please subscribe to the Channel please share with your friends with sensitive skin and I'll see you guys for the next video guys okay take care peace foreign",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds I'm Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to Pillow Talk durm where we meet every Saturday morning to expand your brain and mind in the process if you have no idea who I am subscribe so you know what's good for you but I am a board certified dermatologist and today we are going to be focusing on rosacea because it is the last weekend of rosacea awareness month and I've taken pity on you flushed red human beings out there so we're going to focus on how to better identify your rosacea and help yourself but before I do that make sure you head on over to d r ris.com because I am starting a new newsletter that's going out every week that is purely educational focused from Dr eris.com so we'll be recapping some of the YouTubes we'll be focusing on new topics if you guys have questions make sure to email us at hello.com and we will make sure to incorporate those questions into that newsletter every week so head on over there I will link it below on the screen so back to rosacea what is it what causes it how do you identify it we're going to get in right now rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition it is not acne and I have to start off by saying this because as a Derm I get so annoyed when I see the marketing around ingredients for rosacea as acne but I understand why they do this and I'm going to let you guys in on something take for example sulfur which we're going to talk about in this video in order to get a drug fact label on a sulfur product so you can have a quote unquote medical indication for that ingredient you have to abide by what the FDA sees that ingredient fit for sulfur has traditionally been approved by the FDA for acne so they often write for example on sulfur purpose acne treatment and that's huge for a brand that they can actually say that so they're going to go ahead and run with it but sulfur is traditionally great for rosacea and not necessarily acne so I think in the process the public has gotten confused and started confusing the two and treating rosacea like acne but that is probably the worst thing you can do because it can disrupt your Skin Barrier more and it can inflame your rosacea worse in the process but I wanted you guys to understand this very nuanced thing so that you know as a person that rosacea is truly not acne it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is due to a multitude of different things we actually don't know exactly why you get it we do believe there is a genetic predisposition when you think of Rosa you think of a white person who gets really red but do not assume that darker skin tones can't have rosacea either it is just harder to detect and see but they can absolutely have rosacea too and it's usually due to a multitude of different factors from genetics chronic heat UV exposure a broken Skin Barrier little tiny mites like these called Demodex mites that are just going rampid on your skin we all have them some of us have them a little bit more than others and when they wake up and they're alive they tend to just mess up but deodex mites an overabundance of reactivity in terms of flushing etc etc etc and when you have a little bit of everything The Perfect Storm can show up on your face when you're nervous when you're stressed when you're hot when you're eating spicy foods when you're on a date you name it but there are really if you want to take a step back four main types of rosacea starting with the most common emodal ectatic rosacea Arial means red tantic means blood vessels rosesa is rosesa so when you have somebody who's red with a lot of broken blood vessels all over their face they have one of the most common forms known as the athematic type then you have the one that I think people get confused by that they confuse with adult acne papulo pular rosacea papules and P little red bumps and little tiny bumps all over your face usually along the cheeks the nose maybe a little bit here can sometimes happen along the chin interesting tip and this one's a good one you do not have blackheads in rosacea and with rosacea the nasal labial folds this area is spared so if you're having all of a sudden a breakout right here around your mouth it's probably not rosacea if it affects your nasal laal folds then you have the the third type which is like your old white uncle that you just can't or maybe you love or you just don't really like I don't know maybe I'm projecting but you have Fus rosacea where when you have chronic inflammation right and enlarged sweat glands the skin can appear thicker and your pores can look enlarged and your nose starts to get really distended and honestly deformed over time it can happen to your nose it can happen to your chin it can happen to your forehead that's the Fus type then the fourth type is ocular rosacea which people often Overlook completely but the eyes are usually affected in 50% of rosacea sufferers and what do you get with that you get blefaritis so inflammation along the eyelid margins you can get redness of the white part of your eye you have to take an eye hygiene into consideration but also when your eyes are affected and they're chronically inflamed especially the lid margins you want to calm that inflammation down so you don't f up your eyeballs in the process and have scratches on your corneil so that's usually an oral medication and that's why you shouldn't be scared of going on systemic medications but you should probably also see an opthalmologist and let them know about it so how can you then help yourself first without going into any sort of over-the-counter products or even prescription medications or in office treatments there's lifestyle and the things associated with lifestyle you're not going to like but this is the hard truth hot showers no steam no all of you weirdos love Hot Yoga that Take 5 hours to go in and out to actually do I tried doing it one year and I died no we don't do hot yoga spicy food I mean everything in moderation okay every once in a while it's fine but if you're going to eat like chili peppers with every meal you're going to mess up your Rosa alcohol caffeine chocolate a lot of chocolate can affect stress yes we need to start meditating in the morning certain medications the list goes on and on and on so you really do have to start listening to your skin and understanding how you're reacting to certain triggers whether it is sitting out in the sun or going into a hot yoga room or doing a steam or a sauna etc etc cooking maybe it's a perfect excuse for you not to cook and so you guys get the gist right make it work to your benefit so what are then the top ingredients that we can incorporate into our routine if we have rosacea and we're trying to help ourselves and I'm going to look for things that are calming and soothing that are going to help restore our Skin Barrier that are going to reduce inflam and that are basically Beyond The Gentle basic skin care that we think of when we think of basic sensitive skin like Cal oatmeal panol Etc glycerin we want to look for ingredients that are going to actively help reduce the look of that is the correct way of saying it if you are in the industry because you can't claim that it's reducing inflammation it's helping reduce the look of inflammation and redness number one and this is probably the most popular one on the market that I think a lot of Ros of people know about and look for directly Santella atica Santella atica is known for redness reducing properties anti-inflammatory properties it has atico sdes medas aides and aziatic acid in it which all have anti-inflammatory effects and it reduces the look of inflammation it has been shown also just side note to promote collagen production so and it also has certain antioxidants that can protect the skin from the damage caused by free radicals obviously full disclosure my brand the depuffer why do I love this product if you have rosacea because it is loaded in centella asiatica but it also has arnica and arnica is not one that is traditionally thought of for rosacea but it works like a charm because it helps reduce the redness and calms the inflammation in a synergistic way that your skin looks def flushed within a couple of minutes when done correctly at the right concentration arnica is tricky though because when you guys look for arnica products more often than not they're diluted in a homeopathic fashion this one is purely Brown because it is pure arnica the color that you guys see here this golden hue is due to the high concentration of arnica in this formulation then you have one that a lot of people with rosacea know about Dr jart Dr jart has his tiger grass which is another name for cantella asiatica color correcting treatment it's a mineral sunscreen with zinc and titanium and it has a green tint to it and a more opaque fashion versus this that is going to help neutralize the look of redness because when you're red you want green to block the red we're not going to go into the art of it take an art course that's not my jam although I do like painting number two we have sulfur I hinted at sulfur at the beginning of this video sulfur is going to be marketed as an acne treatment I.E like on this when you see eradicate daily foaming cleanser acne treatment because it has 3% sulfur but it's not really just an acne treatment it's a rosacea treatment why because sulfur helps to minimize inflammation it regulates seen production a lot of people with rosacea have a lot of overproduced seim think of the nose think of the chin and it also helps to minimize inflammation as well it has antimicrobial properties which is helpful right but not the main reason of why it works and it has mild exfoliating properties but it's not going to over strip you and Break Your Skin Barrier worse making your rosacea flare up in the process there's another product by pieter Thomas Roth they have a 10% sulfur clay mask which is much more potent than the cleanser form and then you have one available at your local drugstore called Dela Cruz where you can literally spend a couple of bucks smell like a rotten egg and improve your skin in the process so those are the sulfur products that are high up at number two when it comes to ingredients number three is AAL acid AAL acid is an ingredient that I have a honestly more of a love love relationship with a little bit of a hate because it's not elegant it pills and it messes up a formula when you mix it with other actives at the right% and in order to use aoic acid if you have rosacea you really want to be at 10% or above but above that is prescription and prescription is 15% which is sweet spot and I don't know how the prescription is formulated but it's so elegant finaa is so elegant and I do not get paid by that drug company whatsoever um but it's a 15% prescription on to over the- counter though we have paa choice this is a 10% AIC acid booster I believe um it has a little bit of licorice it does have salicylic acid I don't know the percent of Sal acid in this if you're sensitive or you think your barrier is inflamed beware don't go for it because the Sal acid might mess you up but AIC acid like I said regul Ates your anti-inflammatory properties and antibacterial properties and it helps as an antioxidant as well Dr Sam bunting across the pond in the UK has her Flawless nightly serum which is a 10% aoic acid serum as well it has 5% niacinamide it does have a Ester form of vitamin C at 2% so it's not going to be the active form of vitamin C but it might be a nice one if you are a rosacea sufferer trying to use vitamin see in the morning wanting to get away with some AIC acid I hear beautiful things I started looking into it because of you guys dming me about it so that is hers and then the ordinary this one's great at night when you have nowhere to go and you don't care who you're seeing it is a 10% a acid suspension you do kind of sometimes have to shake it I feel but it appears nice and elegant but it does pill after a while so do not be fooled by the first impression with this it's 11 bucks though so you not really go wrong and then like I said prescription number four hypochlorous acid you guys have started hearing about this all over Instagram Tik Tok YouTube I don't know what else you guys are on I can't keep up with the social media platforms but hypochlorous acid is one that has been used in medicine for decades I actually use it before every cosmetic procedure to clean my patients faces because it has antimicrobial effects and it is gentle so it's not going to over strip their skin like using plain oil isopropyl alcohol or an alcohol wipe it is now available in fancier forms at nicer stores but you can also get it at your local drugstore as a generic this is one that is available at Walgreens it is really not that expensive at all and you can use it every day on your face in the morning and at night if you're somebody who wears a mask for whatever reason at the height of the pandemic I used to spray my mask with hypoc chloris acid to minimize the breakout around the mouth area number five this is one that people don't often think of when they have rosacea a lot of people with rosacea think they have chronically dry skin over here it's always flaking but then when I ask my patients is your skin dry or oily they go it's more oily but it flakes okay it's not dry skin it's not flaking because it's dry it is a yeast living on your skin and you have dandruff of your face a lot of rosacea patients have dandruff of their face around their eyebrows right here in the corners of their nose or even along their eyelid margins and you can even see it sometimes in front of their ears and they need ketoconazol neral shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp that you can use a couple of times a week on your face to keep that yeast at Bay okay um it's an anti-fungal medicine that can help really help your face and I think when that is sort of subsided and you calm the subar dermatitis down you minimize the inflammation associated with it and your redness gets better in the long run so this is something that you're going to have to incorporate throughout the course of your life and you have to figure out the Cadence of how you want to incorporate it the shampoo is not necessarily the best as a face wash because it's not the ideal pH it might be a little bit stripping but if you use it several times periodically maybe twice a week maybe it's four times a week maybe it's once a week I don't know what the right Cadence is for you and you do it in the areas that are actually the worst letting it sit for a few minutes before washing it off you will see a huge difference in your skin in the long run also just side note I use the shampoo right here I've been using it right here when I wash my hair I let it sit for 5 minutes not because I have dandruff but because I have thinning hair there and I have noticed that my hair is starting to get thicker poor AI okay number six benzil peroxide and you're going to go wait wait wait wait wait is benzil peroxide and adne medication yes it is is it great for rosacea no it's not but if you have this little Mite called a Demodex Mite out of control on your face then benzil peroxide can be helpful for you now not all rosacea people have Demodex mites going crazy on their face but a lot of them do and the way I hear it described from my patients is that they feel like their skin is a little bit reactive and itchy not painful not irrit ated but just like this is probably the get your mind out of the gutter okay but this is probably the best action I can describe it as okay but benzil peroxide can help kill it now you don't need a 10% benzil peroxide wash stronger isn't better something like at 5% we have this in my office is great it's going to help kill that bacteria the little mites and keep it at Bay all right FYI because of the drug fact label benzil peroxide comes up as acne but this can be helpful for Demodex mites as well okay number seven my favorite zinc oxide no it's not sunscreen I'm talking about diaper rash cream Triple Paste zinc oxide is a beautiful ingredient it has anti-inflammatory effects when a kid has a rash down there you slap this all over their little tushies in a gentle way in order to minimize their rash to calm the inflammation down so they have less friction Etc on their privates when it comes to your face if you have an inflamed Skin Barrier and you're trying to restore your barrier zinc oxide can really help restore that barrier and when it comes in the form of a diaper rash cream when it's married to petrolatum it will help create an occlusive layer while calming any inflammation down and it works wonders as an overnight mask treatment especially in a dry climate or in a very cold climate or when the temperatures are changing not all diaper rash creams are created equal don't go for one with essential oils definitely don't and make sure there's no steroid in it cuz that can make things worse I was sponsored by this company after I spoke about them it was a very organic thing and that's why I took that sponsorship because I was like how funny Would it be that the one sponsorship I'm excited about is a buttpaste company but this is probably my favorite one not because of that sponsorship I have two kids who are six and four I wasn't sponsored then but this was the one that I used on my kids so that is the diaper rash cream k for that and then we're going to talk about options for quickly prescriptions but we're not going to waste too much time on this because you can't prescribe medications for yourselves at least not as of yet but who knows what the future holds but aik acid 15% that's great you want to incorporate that metronidazol is a topical antibiotic that you guys can use it's been very well studied for rosacea it is also beautiful and santra which is the trade name the generic name is itin is an antiparasitic that also kills Demodex I often times prescribe all three and I tell patients go plop ploop ploop put three dots mix mix mix apply to face twice a day and it really does help a lot with people with rosacea to help keep all of it at Bay and you can use this long term you can use aoic acid when you're pregnant you can use metronidazol when you're pregnant and last I checked you can use cilantro when you're pregnant in office we can take it up a notch and you guys can really help yourselves by reducing the Cosmetic look of redness by getting the beams vascular laser beams also pulse known as the pulse die laser which in my book is the gold standard you guys might get Groupon deals for ipls or bbls for rosacea it doesn't work as well an IPL and a BBL is a light it is not a laser you're going to need a lot more treatments and you better be going to somebody who is qualified because you might get burnt in the process because they are not as specific as a laser and you need to know what you're doing with them in order to treat your rosacea correctly and then if you have enlarged sweat glands on your nose or on your chin you can do electr surgery you can shave it down people actually use sandpaper believe it or not in conjunction with other devices and lasers to help minimize the look of that but you're probably not watching this video I am assuming if that is your case and you have timeus changes on your nose um because it's usually older white men who get that so I don't think they're watching this YouTube um but that is pretty much what we can do the bird ey view in office and the last thing I want to just say is rosacea might appear like a very benign chronic condition but it has a really deep psychological influence and psychosocial impact on people knowing that you're flushing when you're embarrassed makes you more embarrassed and makes it worse as somebody who has had 10 V beams in one year yes 10 why because I would go to the gym and I would get stopped on the street when I was working out and they would ask me do you need to go to the hospital are you okay cuz I looked like a beat I wasn't red I was like purple red and so I told myself let me just treat this with the vbm and I ended up doing 10 one year and I maintain it probably with one or two treatments a year now I treat my whole face it is really psychologically draining thinking oh my God are my emotions showing on my face and my ears so don't just down for rosacea awareness month and if you guys have any questions or comments as always leave them below but I hope you have a beautiful Saturday [Music]",

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare product recommendations for persistent facial redness I know it's really frustrating to deal with I really hope this video was informative to you guys everything I mentioned will be linked in the description box if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]",

        "published_at": "2023-07-09T14:30:28Z",
        "transcript": "kind of feel like I'm the poster child for the benefits of azoleic acid it literally has done for my skin what no other skincare ingredient or product has done and that is keeping my rosacea and inflammatory skin at Bay just look at how my skin has struggled with rosacea over the years and look at it now I have been using over-the-counter azoleic acid skin care products for the last few years and I've already done videos on some of my favorite products so I'll link those at the end of this video and also in the description box below I'm not really going to go into that today what I'm going to do is answer the question I get repeatedly asked here on YouTube over on Tick Tock and Instagram and that is how do I layer azelaic acid effectively in my skincare routine so just a very brief overview of azoleic acid and its benefits to the skin if you're new to this particular ingredient azelic acid is a naturally occurring and skin identical ingredient just meaning that it is already present in our skin so known terosinase inhibitor which is responsible for producing melanin in the skin skin which gives color to our skin which is why as an ingredient azelic acid is great to Target hyperpigmentation issues and also melasma it also has exfoliating properties it is not an aha or an alpha hydroxy so it doesn't perform exactly the same as glycolic acid or lactic acid but it can help to smooth out your skin tone and even out your texture basically a gentle option that can even suit sensitive skin types but the greatest benefit for me has been its antimicrobial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties this is what makes it ideal for rosacea and acne prone skin helping to calm and soothe and reduce the inflammation Associated redness and pimples this is why I turned to this ingredient in the first place because I have struggled for years with the side effects of rosacea my skin is combination it's sensitive from rosacea prone it also tends to be dehydrated and when my rosacea flares It's My Skin Barrier that is very much impaired some of my triggers I know and recognize and others I don't even know what they are overdoing things in my skincare routine is definitely a trigger because if I compromise my barrier by using too many active ingredients all at once or things that are too strong for my skin will set my rosacea on fire drinking red wine I hate that one because I actually like drinking red wine and the Sun is one of my biggest triggers so I try to mitigate those wrists as best I can I wear a sunscreen I focus on my skincare routine and really focus on maintaining My Skin Barrier and I limit the amount of red wine that I drink the regular use of azelaic acid just simply cannot be understated for me when I put together my morning and evening skincare routine I just follow a very simple philosophy and that is maintain and prioritize My Skin Barrier at all costs so that means being flexible with my routines if my skin is in a compromised State I will adjust my skincare routines to be simply hydrating and really focus on that barrier repair but if my skin skin is in good health like it is right now in the morning I like to prioritize a vitamin C because I want the well-aging benefits associated with it and in the evening I sort of revolve my routines around the regular use of a retinoid using acid exfoliation limited just because of my skin and hydrating skin care so how does azoleic acid fit into all of that it's quite simple really let's start with the morning azoleic acid and vitamin C actually do pair very well together I say that but that is also with a bit of a caveat vitamin C is an ingredient that lots of people are irritated with that sounds like I'm saying oh vitamin C you're pissing me off today A lot of people are irritated by vitamin C that doesn't even sound any better A lot of people have irritation on their skin when they use vitamin C I think that makes sense but if you use vitamin C regularly and love to gain the benefits from it then pairing an azaleaic acid with that works really well try it on its own to see that you have no issues with the product and then try pairing them together if you're good you're good for my morning routine I like to cleanse with water only it just works really well to maintain My Skin Barrier rather than using a cleanser I reserve that for my evening routine we'll talk about that in a moment I also like to tone my skin after cleansing and that's because toners these days are just packed full of nice hydrating ingredients and then I wait for my skin to dry before I apply my vitamin C serum then I apply my azoleic acid and then I apply a moisturizer and then a sunscreen and that is my morning routine I tend to follow the philosophy of thinnest consistency of products to thickest consistency of products but I do make exceptions the azaleaic acid that I'm currently using is a prescription strength this is a 15 azaleaic acid it does have a creamy texture so in terms of texture it sort of sits well in my skincare routine at that point this is a 15 azaleaic acid most over-the-counter products are going to be under 15 and can range anywhere from three up to 10 percent is normally what I see just showing you the texture here it really sinks into the skin quite nicely but don't always believe that more equals more over-the-counter options have shown to be very efficacious as well even in a range from three to five percent I've seen lots of people say that azelic acid does better after some of your active ingredients in your skincare routine but if the azelaic acid you're using is a much thinner consistency you could put it earlier in your routine if you wish I don't really know that there is a true hard and fast rule on that but I've been doing it this way for a couple of years and it seems to be really working for my skin so there's your anecdotal evidence at least from me I love that vitamin C and azelic acid pair so well together because I can really combine all the well-aging benefits that I'm also trying to Target in my skin combined with what I need to support my rosacea azelic acid can have some side effects for some people including dryness and flaky skin some people find that it tingles or stings a bit upon application I haven't had that experience and perhaps it's because I did a slow introduction when I introduced it initially when I started using over-the-counter osceolaic acids I was only using it once per day in my skincare routine when I moved up to the prescription strength my doctor recommended that I use it twice in my skincare routine so both morning and evening that's particular to my needs so of course if you're using a prescription strength azolacic acid you'll be in consultation with your medical professional moving into my evening routines I'm just going to explain a few of the routines that I sprinkle throughout the week starting with a hydrating skincare routine I usually do a routine like this every other day that I'm not using a retinoid or an alpha hydroxy acid it gives my skin the chance to repair itself and I find it's a really good strategy for my rosacea skin and prioritizing my skin barrier as much as I want the benefits of well-aging products and retinoids in particular throughout the week in my skin skincare routine for me it just doesn't work so well that way because my skin will get easily compromised and then I'm back to square one let me know in the comments if you're able to use a retinoid every day or if you're kind of like me and have to balance it out with other routines just to be sure that you're not damaging Your Skin Barrier if I'm doing a simple hydrating skincare routine I would double cleanse my skin that's using an oil cleansing balm or a micellar water to remove all the dirt oil makeup sunscreen debris from my face followed up with a water-based cleanser again I would apply a toner to my damp skin after cleansing then I would follow up with my hydrating serum or serums I like to use face oils and then a moisturizer on the evenings that I use an alpha hydroxy acid I do not use a nasolic acid in the same routine Alpha hydroxy acids for me are already borderline irritating for my skin that routine I need to hold kind of sacred and be very very careful because overdoing it with an acid can easily set my rosacea on fire so when I do that skincare routine for me it's once a week and I get great results from doing it that way so I really don't need to do it every single day but I know some people like to and can double cleanse apply my toner apply my Alpha hydroxy to dry skin and then follow up with a face oil and moisturizer and that's it as for a BHA or a beta hydroxy acid I do the same thing I typically use a BHA on its own once per week and so I keep my azulaic acid out of that routine however when acelic acid is formulated with a BHA salicylic acid then it's no problem and this one is really great from Paula's choices they're 10 azoleic acid booster formulated together with salicylic acid a lot of the times people get hung up on what can and cannot be paired together when it's formulated together all of those things are taken into consideration it's when you're layering products yourself acting like a little cosmetic chemist in your bathroom which I love to do that is when you can be at risk or an increased risk of irritation because there's no formulation in there helping those two ingredients to work synergistically together and reducing the level of irritation but could you layer them together yes if your skin can tolerate it you can that's the beauty of azelic acid it fits in well with other skin care products very effectively for my retinoid night I have found no issue with layering azelic acid in my retinoid together I typically use a retinaldehyde and if you don't know what that is or anything about the retinoid family don't worry I've done a video explaining everything there is to know about retinoids because I was so confused when I first started using them I'll link that at the end of this video and in the description box below for you as well so for that routine I would double cleanse tone my skin apply my retinol to dry skin apply my osceolaic acid face oil and moisturizer I hope this video has helped you understand how I put together my skincare routines using azoleic acid and for me prioritizing it in both my evening and morning skincare routines be sure to drop your azelic acid

        "transcript": "rosacea is a condition i commonly see in clinics so in this video we're going to talk about what is rosacea how to best treat it and i'm going to offer some of my skincare tips for those of you who suffer from rosacea hi my name is dr jenny liu i'm a board certified dermatologist in minneapolis and welcome to my youtube channel so what is rosacea rosaceae is a chronic and inflammatory skin condition often characterized by skin sensitivity along with a tendency to flush and look rosy and red but also may develop pimple like bumps especially along the central face so the cheeks the nose the chin and the forehead and that is a very big definition of rosacea because we know that rosacea have various different presentations in fact we even used to categorize rosacea into four subtypes we still do for more academic purposes but for when we are seeing a patient in clinic we don't use those subcategories to really treat the patient we treat based on the clinical findings and the symptoms because we know for most individuals with rosacea they'll often have kind of a collection of various different subtypes number one is called erythrometal tylangitatic and that is the redness the flushing that we often see like the cheeks the nose the chin sometimes it can be very severe and large broken visible blood vessels can be present sometimes awareness often will flare with certain triggers and those triggers are different for everyone but common things would be heat wind cold spicy food stress chocolate caffeine all the good stuff subtype two is papular pustular rosacea so this is more than kind of what they used to call adult acne even though it's not truly acne but often gets misdiagnosed or mistaken for acne will present it is these pink zit or pimple like bumps and sometimes even pustules often on the nose the cheeks and the chin the third time is called phymatis and this has to do with chronic inflammation and over growth of your oil glands essentially often will present as more like a bulbous skin bulbous nose and that's called rhinophyma with uneven surface and texture with dilated pore like appearance but that feminist change can also be seen of the forehead as well as the chin and lastly the fourth subtype of rosacea is ocular rosacea and yes you can definitely get rosacea in your eyes often these patients will have like a dry and gritty like sensation grading the sensation in the eye sometimes eyelid margins can get crusty they can get styes and the whiteness of their eye can look more red and injected as i mentioned earlier most individuals will have a spectrum of these conditions and well being having the type 1 and type 2 so the flushing the redness along with pimples being the most common presentation that we see so why does rosacea happen you know unfortunately we are still trying to elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea so we don't completely understand it however we do know that it is very common affects 60 million americans and we often see it in like in the late 20s and 30s not so much in their kids and teenagers tends to present in adulthood now genetics do play a role in rosacea we tend to see this running in families as far as what is happening underneath the skin we do know that there are certain things that we see in rosacea patients that we don't see in individuals who don't have rosacea so number one there is a defective skin barrier and that could be a reason why often rosacea patients will complain that their skin is more sensitive either to products or to the environmental triggers there is increased interest epidermal water loss so the inability of the skin to hold on to water and tend to be more dry flaky and dehydrated we also know that there is actually a decreased amount of lipid production of the stratum corneum in rosacea patients similar there tends to be a an immunogenic so pro-inflammatory response for some reason and the inflammation will generate a cascade of reactions leading to production of enzymes that will generate inflammation but also can degrade collagen and we think that inflammation in part is what's responsible for the redness and those pimples that we see in rosacea patients furthermore there is what we call a neurogenic dysregulation so hypersensitivity along with again that clinical presentation that we see of being more sensitive to certain triggers and lastly there tends to be a hyper reaction to an organism that lives in the oil glands so there is a mite called demodex mite that we see in six percent of the normal healthy population there are these little bugs that you can actually even scrape out of the skin and put on a slide and clinic sometimes we'll do this and you can see these little prolly little critters and it's like i can't believe this just came out of my skin but in rosacea patients we found that there tends to be a higher density but not only is it the presence of these mites but we think in abnormal response to these mites is what is associated with the more popular and postular variant of rosacea now as mentioned earlier there can be common triggers for individual rosacea but one of the biggest risk factors is ultraviolet radiation we know that uv radiation is pro-inflammatory damages dna generates inflammatory response reactive estrogen cdc's and also upregulates all these inflammatory cytokines that already are pre-existing in rosacea patients that will often make that worse which is why it is super important to be doing thorough and diligent sun protection on a regular basis furthermore we know that in individuals who are more red and have dilated and broken blood vessels the sun often will make that worse so how we treat rosacea really depends on the presentation so if it's redness often lasers avoiding triggers certain prescription topicals can be helpful at temporarily reducing the amount of redness and obviously camouflaging is helpful when it comes to the papules or the pustules acne like bumps often prescription topicals and sometimes even oral medications are necessary for really severe cases i mentioned earlier oral antibiotics and sometimes even oral retinoids are used for severe cases but those overgrowth of sebaceous glands laser and certain type of procedures can be helpful next i'm going to offer some tips for general skin care and some of my personal favorite skin care products that i recommend for my rosacea patients the most important thing is if you do have rosacea is to see your dermatologist because like i said often prescription medications are really going to be helpful to help your rosacea get under control but nevertheless proper skincare is still going to be really really important and really the foundation as always you want to test out any products before using them and when it comes to skincare gentle is the way to go and less is more i recommend just a good gentle cleanser once or twice a day from cerave their hydrating cleanser vana cream facial cleanser is another really good one just find one that is going to be effective but not over strip your skin's natural oil now moisturizers are really going to be the key at helping to hydrate moisturize prevent trans epidermal water loss and really help to repair your skin barrier one of my favorite products is the one from cetaphil their redness relief night moisturizer this is very calming and soothing it contains ceramides niacinamide and shea butter and it's just a really good moisturizer and this is one of you that i have found that when my skin is like say recovering from a chemical peel and tends to be more sensitive it will not burn and has never burned my skin similarly another one that i personally love and use all the time is the two layering ultra moisturizing cream from la roche posay this is a thicker moisturizer contains glycerin thermal spring water shea butter and the neurosensing which is a peptide that they've actually done clinical studies on using this product on rosacea patients and has been found to have an anti-inflammatory and calming effects so this is one that i also really love one more moisturizer that i like especially to spot trace certain really irritated areas is the event sickle fades restorative cream and this is a zinc based zinc is really helpful for repairing skin it's used a lot in healing this is definitely kind of more white and pasty thick enough to even use on chapped lips if you need again something that can be really helpful soothing to the skin pretty thick so probably would use as needed to spot treat definitely can use it all over your face but i find that to be too a little bit too sick and heavy been occlusive and for those who want a lighter moisturizer either to use in the morning or if you have more oily skin the two that i've always recommended to my patients are one from cerave their pm facial moisturizer this is great i mean it says pm but it's lightweight it's oil free great to use under sunscreen in the morning in fact i do that sometimes as well as the laura's procedure and double facial moisturizer both of these are really helpful they're both oil free fast absorbing both contain ceramides and nice cinnamon that's gonna be helping to repair skin barrier and soothing so it's really just like a toss up i honestly love both and kind of will rotate through both of them depending on my mood now one last product that i have really been liking when my skin is just super sensitive is using an overnight sleeping mask one that i found to be really soothing and calming is the one from skin fix the redness relief overnight sleeping mask and this contains honey peptides and other calming ingredients and you wear it like a sleeping mask so you would wear it over your moisturizer and you will sleep in that it really helps to hydrate the skin repair the skin barrier and it's just very soothing and it really feels really good when you put it on your skin and it's kind of formulated for those with more sensitive red and rosacea prone skin so i would love to know if you've tried this please comment below and let me know what you think now i cannot finish off a rosacea video without talking and stressing the importance of wearing sunscreen i've talked about various types of my favorite sunscreens in my previous video and i will link some of my favorites that i think are well suited for rosacea prone skin down below in the description box but sunscreen is one of those no products that the best one is the one that you like enough that works well for your skin that you will remember and want to wear on a daily basis in general rosacea patients tend to tolerate mineral based sunscreen a little bit better just because often with this chemical sunscreen it can be more irritating and can burn but i have found a handful of mario's tissue patients including my skin that tends to be sensitive can tolerate certain types of chemical sunscreens it really all depends on the formulation here is where you have to try you want to make sure you're putting on enough most people under apply so at least a teaspoon for your head and neck reapply it throughout the day and this is really important because we do know that ultraviolet radiation come through windows and most of us because we under apply and your sunscreen gets rubbed off throughout the day that is going to make a huge difference when it comes to protecting your skin so really make sure that you are reapplying using the proper amount so those are some of my favorite skincare recommendations i hope you guys found this video helpful and let me know if you have rosacea if you have tried any of these products that i've recommended i'd love to hear what you think about them similarly if you have a holy grail product that i did not mention today comment below because i would love to try them out myself and hopefully recommend them to my patients as well if you enjoy watching this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel again you can follow me on my various social media accounts until next time thanks

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "good morning good morning welcome back to the Vlog today I am GNA of course start my skincare routine and I was thinking about those of you out there with Rosa you deal with burning stinging symptoms of sensitivity when you use your skincare products with rosacea people develop redness on the cheeks little bumps that are red and filled with pus but in people who have deeper skin tones those skin signs sometimes are missed um or are not as obvious especially to the untrained eye and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up getting misdiagnosed and they have rosacea so talking about symptoms with your doctor is one of the most helpful pieces of information for guiding the diagnosis of Ros but symptoms include burning stinging itch sensations of warmth in the face that come and go as well as discomfort in the eyes and of course problems with skin care products and cosmetics if you have rosacea cleansing can be a really delicate tricky balance because definitely can burn and sting and can wear away at your already kind of weaken Skin Barrier to make those symptoms of sensitivity worse a lot of cleansers burn and sting so use a really gentle mild creamy cleanser if you're feeling really sensitive use lukewarm water and try just washing your face once a day cleansing oils and cleansing balms are a great option to remove um dirt oil and Cosmetics first because they're less likely to burn and sting got to get the drips off all right I'm coming in with the healthy renew face serum I've really been enjoying this now this would be a good option for a lightweight hydrating serum if you have sensitive skin because this whole product line is meant for people with sensitive skin and it's moisturizing to help minimize the symptoms of sensitivity but it's this particular Serum is not heavy sometimes heavy moisturizers for people with rosacea can actually elicit a flush not everyone but some people so the face cream in this line I really like but it is very rich so if you are sensitive to really heavy moisturizers and you want something more lightweight go with the serum for my sunscreen today I'm going to use a cavey hydrating sheer sunscreen I reviewed this a while ago it's a hybrid sunscreen it's water resistant um it's all right um but I want to use it up you know I buy these products to try out and review and then I want to make sure I finish them so they don't go to waste this hybrid sunscreen is more the consistency is more of a almost a fluid it kind of is like a cross between a fluid and a cream hybrid sunscreen just means zinc plus some organic AKA chemical filters so the cast in I find is a lot less noticeable in comparison to an all mineral but I also find that these hybrid sunscreens are a lot less likely to sting in comparison to the organic AKA chemical sunscreens so if you find that organic sunscreens chemical sunscreens burn sting but you're put off by the heavy white cast of an all mineral sunscreen try a hybrid sunscreen it's a nice balance it's not a zero cast though if you have a deeper skin tone it will show up but it is a lot less noticeable and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up using the hybrid sunscreens and they say you know after a while it just kind of Blends in and it's not so bad it all depends on your background skin tone though I wish these Brands would provide samples that way you know how it's going to look on your skin before you buy the bottle because while I like to think my reviews help you guys in deciding whether or not you're going to buy something or not you can't really tell just looking at how a product looks on my skin how it's necessarily going to look for you anytime somebody leaves a comment in any one of my videos like saying is this a good sunscreen for oily skin almost always either on a video or like a Tik Tok or something almost always there'll be someone who's like I've got oily skin I love this it's my Holy Grail then there'll be another P person who's like no stay away it's too greasy it's too oily so even those you know those kinds of things it's like you kind of just have to try it for yourself honestly um to see if it ends up working this one is a little bit shiny it's water resistant though which is nice like for humidity and sweat easy to tolerate around the eyes for me again that's another very individualized thing one thing too about sunscreen is that it also helps with the impaired skin barrier and helps reduce symptoms of sensitivity once you have it on there because it's you know helping to reduce water loss and limit penetration and irritance into the skin it's almost like a barrier cream in a sense depending on the consistency especially and sunscreens like this with zinc um are soothing you know zinc can be is anti-inflammatory although some zinc sunscreens are in my experience and yours cuz you guys have told me on the drawing side so I mentioned to you guys the other day that this like new thing that I've been enjoying doing is listening to my audio book which I'm still making my way through um it's called Uh Crossroads anyway so at night to unwind like when I'm making dinner I like to put my headphones on and just listen to the audiobook it kind of helps me tune out and like keeps me from you know Doom scrolling in my mind of just like things that I need to do and it just helps me inwind anyway but you know something about that like you've got to wash behind your ears is the point I'm trying to make like it's a it's an area where a lot of people end up forgetting to wash but um especially if you're wearing headphones a lot because back here you can get a lot of oily buildup and CC dermatitis I actually like to use an anti-dandruff shampoo back here to to clean behind my ears this is an area where you know similar to dandruff on your scalp and SE dermatitis on your face you can get this oily flaky itchy inflame buildup so I like to do that and when you're wearing headphones a lot that creates a moist humid environment that's really more favorable for that little yees malesia so it can make you know this kind of problem behind the ears even more of an issue for you so stay on top of clean it behind your ears kids so I bought this blood pressure monitor cuff on Amazon I've been pretty happy with it because it will syn to an app on your phone so you can keep a log of your blood pressure and heart rate I find that is something that's really useful a useful metric like I'm not I try to not get too into like tracking all these Health metrics because it's sort of like what are you going to do with all that information then you just become like you know somebody who just writes down numbers all the time like how many steps you got in a day like how many hours of sleep and it just becomes like to what end you know what I mean but uh all that to say having a Rec of your blood pressure readings over a period of time it can be a very useful information uh to provide to your doctor because a lot of people um deal with what they call white coat hypertension meaning your blood pressure goes up in the doctor's office cuz maybe you're nervous stressed out um they call it white coat hypertension like because they attribute it to being nervous about the doctor but honestly it's gotten to a point where the amount of time you have to wait in a doctor's office is so frustrating that it gets your blood pressure up too so it should be like um you know waiting room waiting room hypertension like the stress of of having to wait anyway um so I got this and I've been really happy with it the cuff is um standard size and it it also will fit a large larger arm and it's been doing well so yeah it's it's useful and I I think you know like I said what what good are all these numbers well like if you go to the doctor's office and you have a higher a blood pressure reading on the higher end they're probably you know going to tell you to maybe check it again and you know it can kind of be a thing so having this and having a record to show them is really helpful because a lot of times your blood pressure will will run a certain way and it'll be very different in the office so that's handy to have I've got my little pumpkin back there I'm still burning the Tuscany trick-or treat candle the cupcake one it's not my favorite favorite scent I think I've complained about this already in multiple Vlogs and I have re I purchased a new another candle on their Halloween set that I'm I'm itching to buy I'm itching to to light into but I have this thing in my personality where like with the candle I'm going to burn it unless it's like really really foul which this is isn't it's just kind of like you know I know Tuscany can give a better candle profile um unless it's just really foul I'm going to burn that thing all the way and I'm not going to start a new candle until I finished it some people burn more than one candle at a time and let the the fragrances like mingle and I bet that's really nice if you get the right pairing but I'm always like on the fence about if I should do that or if it's going to be like weird and and and mess things up like I think one of my favorite to skinny candles is the Lemon sugar cookie and I really think that the lemon sugar cookie would be nice over like some of those more Berry scents I think that would be like a nice kind of way to blend those two but I don't know what would go good with cupcake maybe a cinnamon scented candle so it was a gorgeous day on this Sunday I had to get out I could not spend it inside as you can see the sky is really really blue and gorgeous I'm over by the River Oaks neighborhood where they're all these Mansions I love to drive by these houses and just Ogle them lot of them have these like massive walls in front of them so you can't really see them too well but over the holidays this neighborhood is really fun to come to because they go all out lighting up their mansions and they all look beautiful uh it's just something to see something to behold I wanted to go to Memorial Park um and so that's a bit of a drive but it kind of ended up to be a fail because actually I could not find a parking space uh because everybody wanted to get out which like I've said in other Vlogs I try and get outside as much as possible during the day it's actually really good for your sleep cycle for your mental health to get outside in during daylight hours and spend time Outdoors uh as much as possible like especially if you work swing shifts can really help set your clock back so because I couldn't find a place to park I ended up coming over to Rice Village uh area and they have that nice walking trail uh getting some Cloud footage here I just think it's so Zen but I used to walk around this uh Park a lot um in my older apartment but I I haven't been here in a while it's always a fun time let me know in the comments I think some of you went to Rice so hopefully this footage brings back fond memories of your own stomping grounds but uh I love the pretty oak trees that line This walking path I did not know that this existed this Garden back here it's for the students but I had to come and check it out they have all sorts of beautiful flowers the garden was actually closed but you can it is open to the I guess open to the public um during certain hours yeah here's a little sign I guess um some alumni donated money for this garden and the idea is like to have a space for students to come and like learn about gardening so maybe one day they will have their own garden all right so I am going to show you guys some double cleansing in action here uh this particular night I decided I was going to use I've been using that DHC deep cleansing oil that I got from sty and I have rather been enjoying it it's very similar to the hot alabo cleansing oil um similar ingredients like olive oil but it has an aroma to it to it it has I think it has Rosemary in it so you can definitely smell that but it's a pleasant cleansing oil to use one of the reasons I love using cleansing oil so much is they're just a effective at removing Cosmetics like on this particular day I'm wearing uh that Lancome adol mascara I'm also wearing their waterproof eyeliner and this really does a good job getting in there dissolving it breaking it up I can't do makeup removers I always burn my eyes sting my skin if you have rosacea we were talking about this at the beginning of the Vlog but if you have rosacea um and you're looking for a way to remove makeup try cleansing oil or cleansing balm alternatively another good option is Cold Cream like the pwns cold cream is really a good option because it dissolves the makeup but it also is like very soothing um I don't you know they call it cold cream and it does kind of feel nice and chilled going on the skin but the oil is another option or a cleansing balm the main difference between like cleansing balm and cleansing oil it's just the balm is solid at room temperature I also started using the um isant yam root vegan milk cleanser oh my gosh those of you with sensitive skin rosacea consider this mild cleanser because it's such a pleasant experience it's free of fragrance it's very hydrating it has this like slippery texture to it which may be offputting for some but I really enjoy it it almost kind of cloaks your skin in a hug as it Glides across the surface of the skin and gently cleanses without disrupting the underlying Skin Barrier you see with the double cleanse approach the first step the oil cleanser is kind of just like getting in there and breaking up residue buildup on the skin surface the second step with the mild cleanser is actually getting in there and cleansing everything away so that's why I like doing it that way typically I do the second step in the shower but I decided to do it here so you guys could see this cleanser in action and as you can see it took everything off well hey guys I am all clean moisturized hydrated got my tread noan on but um one of the things I was thinking about you know on Sundays I do a Q&A over on my Instagram and I also post it to Facebook or basically I just you know post a still image of myself and I say hey drop any skincare related questions in the comments of this Instagram post or this Facebook post and I will usually answer you know a handful of them as many as I can and I post the question and the response to my Instagram stories and it's saved in a highlight bubble if you go to my Instagram profile anyway one of the questions I got today was like how do you deal with dry eyelids especially if you live in a cold dry climate and I got to tell you petroleum jelly is a game Cher for dry eyelids or eyelid eczema because it prevents water loss really well and it also um prevents penetration of irritance into the skin so it really is a is a great option plus it's free of common allergens and irritant I mean it's basically your immune system really doesn't care about Vaseline so that's a good thing it's just like an inert little barrier support there it's really underrated for all the things you can do it's also beneficial for cutting down on chafing wind bur if you live somewhere cold and windy um what a day y'all today was gorgeous like so nice when the weather is beautiful because you just want to be outside and so soaking it all in and such a mood boost I'm telling you summertime here can get a little like you know winter months get in other places because it's really just too hot to safely be outside for long stretches of time so you kind of get a little you know the a bit of the Blues in the summertime but that being said I really love summer and I find that you know I'm happy as can be throughout the summer cuz I like all of the summer festivities like the summer holidays and summer food summer fruits I really like summer and I love the beach so I don't know winter here I I don't mind because it's pretty mild but winter is not not where it's at for in my mind like no thanks uh I'm not I'm not Team Winter I do like winter when I don't have to go anywhere then it's fine you know it's like all cozy with a fireplace and my coffee and it's relaxing sure winter time sounds Divine but the realities of existing places that have strong you know intense Winters no thank you I don't want to be out there shoving now no thanks defrosting uh the windshield I hate doing that uh I hate driving in icy conditions cuz it's not fun although I got really good at driving in snow when I lived in Colorado like I had this little trick sometimes I get stuck in the snow like in a parking space like you'd park somewhere and then maybe you'd be parked there for a while and then we get a huge dumping of snow and you kind of have to dig your car out the car I had at the time I remember I would get in it and you know you kind of like try and dig some of the snow out as best you could heat up the car so it was somewhat def you know defrosted and then I remember I would like move it forward and back and forward and back and then I would like myself I would I could rock my own car and I could get it to rock out of the out of the space and float away I got good at that you know there's certain things that are really intimidating but once you learn how to do them and you just become comfortable and it becomes a necessity that you do it and do it efficiently then it's like not a big deal anymore like parallel parking is one of those things where you just put yourself in that situation and get uncomfortable a handful of times eventually it will just be like no big deal um that's that's a lot of things like if there's anything that you are intimidated about doing or you're like apprehensive you just kind of have to throw yourself in that situation and I mean provided it's not like hazardous to your health or something you know what I mean like within reason just throw yourself in that situation and be uncomfortable for a couple of times and eventually it just be such a non-issue that you'll start doing it all the time and you'll look back and be like why was I ever freaked out about doing this it's like non B deal all right y'all I am going to wrap this Vlog up I've had a great day I hope you have had a great day thank you so much for watching to the end if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "hello everybody i'm back back back again for my nighttime rosacea skincare routine um you have maybe seen the first part of this video which was my daytime and morning skincare routine for rosacea um so i shared my favorite products there and how i go on about it so today we are concentrating on the evening on cleansing the skin and treating the skin the same way as we did in the morning but i have quite a bit of a different lineup for the evening but the thing is that most of these products you can use morning or evening so i'm just giving you a selection of things that work for me personally and maybe that will work for you too so um if you haven't watched the first part i talked about um there was asia a little bit deeper in a little bit more details there so i recommend tuning into that first and then coming back to this video i decided to split them because the first one was getting so long so first things first i'm going to cleanse my skin because i have makeup on i've been using the it cosmetics cc cream which i love it has such a good high spf and such a beautiful finish on the skin um just love it love it love it so i'm gonna use a double cleanse so we're going to start with an oil cleanser and i'm using squalane and antioxidant cleansing oil this is a plant derived squalane and squalene is a fantastic ingredient to use pretty much on any skin types so i just take a pump and massage it into my skin and if you are into massage like i am this is your time this is your moment to give your skin a bit of loving if you have very very aggravated rosacea or very very sensitive skin and this is especially the good time to do it but just be a little bit more gentle on the areas where you get um quite inflamed where you get a bit red but just circular motions getting into those muscles kind of give your chewing muscle a little bit of extra loving to relax it maybe you're feeling tension around your brows and those angry elevens if you've been frowning a lot i love using my knuckles just because you get a little bit of deeper pressure and really nice on the cheeks as well a few swipes towards the ears and also on the neck if you're wearing makeup on the neck around the nose i've got quite heavy brows today so this is a fantastic oil to take the makeup off but also to do the massage with so i very often do my massages with um with oils with cleansing oils rather than with treatment oils so i'm just massaged it in and now i'm gonna rinse it with some water and a cloth the thing is that if are washing your face with water and you have rosacea or sensitive skin be very mindful about the temperature of the water only use lukewarm water um or like room temperature water but never hot water my second cleanse will be water-based cleanser and i'm using my miracle cleanser from aurelia this is probiotic skincare um and i love it i have been using it um for years now it's not targeting specifically um rosacea but it suits me it does have essential oils in it so if you get reactive to them then maybe um be a little bit more mindful about it but it has never caused me any irritation so again i'm gonna do one pump and it's a beautiful creamy milky cleanser so i've left the water on my face from the first cleanse and then i'm just doing the same this has that aromatherapy effect as well because it has beautiful sense of lavender and chamomile and bergamot and is just absolutely heavenly it's a really lovely cleanser to use in the morning as well if you're a person who use cleanses um most of the time i just rinse my face with water so i'm gonna rinse that off have mascara of course don't forget to take your mascara off and sometimes depending on what routine i'm doing i will leave my face wet and then i will go with my moisturizer straight on top of my wet face just to benefit from that moisture that is already on my skin then i'm going to do a little spritz of serious ink um this is a zinc sulfate solution it is amazingly soothing and calming for your skin zinc is a really great ingredient if you have rosacea and it comes in this really big bottle from la roche posay and it has a beautiful big like fine mist so there we go it's a little bit salty on the lips because of the sink and i just let this dry i just let the sink in give it a moment brush my teeth brush my hair do something like this so i'm going to give it a little second to dry before we move on to serums but while i'm here i want to show you a mask to dig into my drawers i'm not going to do this mask today but this mask when my skin is extra irritated and extra red and i just need that luxurious calming soothing cooling feel on my skin this is what i reach for it is pricey but there's also um nothing like it out there i know quite a few have been hooked on this since i have mentioned it years ago behind because i have been using it for years now and it's the shantikai jasmine and lily mask healing mask this has vitamin b5 it's got chamomile and mimosa and it's soothing it's softening it's calming and it just feels so good on your skin so i definitely recommend having a look if you want maybe to request a present maybe there's an occasion coming up and somebody can gift it to you or you can gift it to yourself as always i will be leaving all the links to all the items that i have mentioned in description box below i have some discount codes for some uh products as well so check the description box before you make any purchases but at the same time don't think this video is sponsored because it is not at all this is purely from my personal experience so we're going to move on to serums and treatments and i use two serums at the moment that have active ingredients one is hyaluronic acid and another one is colostrum colostrum gel is an amazing amazing ingredient unfortunately it's not vegan if you are vegan um and it is amazing to rebuild the barrier of your skin and to strengthen your skin so these has been amazing this is from environ um and byron is one of those brands that you have to look for a stockist to buy their stuff but there are quite a few now online otherwise we have a few um salons and shops that actually stock them so usually i go there uh and hyaluronic acid of course is hydration we want that hydration even if you have oily skin this is a misconception about having oily skin and not wanting to put moisture in a lot of the time your skin is oily because it's dehydrated that is the funny thing about it so i apply two different ones in different areas um different days sometimes i alternate them sometimes i put them on the same time when it comes to hyaluronic acid i either use mylar shape posse this is the hyalu b5 so it's got the b5 vitamin as well or the good molecules hyaluronic acid fantastic to just draw moisture into your skin and then for colostrum i apply one pump into my fingers it's like this funny brown color and then i just massage it into the area of concern so it's got um almost a little bit of a gritty consistency some vitamin c serums have that this doesn't have as much of it um but it's definitely it's not that smooth like i always think that it's not very smooth so i applied all my cheeks and all my temples so this is where i get most of my redness and then on the rest of the face and sometimes on top i will apply my chlorinic acid so i'm going to go with the good molecule ones today it doesn't really matter they're both really really good um a clear gel like a watery gel so i'm gonna apply that on my forehead on my chin jewel line around the lips for neck and chest i also forgot to mention in the morning that if i don't use the lower shape as a moisturizer i use the cerave moisturizer this is the facial moisturizing lotion this has spf 25 and it's fragrance free it's non-comedogenic it's very affordable and it's got ceramides too again again we're talking about that barrier of the skin but also it's just essential to wear spf if you have sensitive skin but even if you don't and even if it's not summer even if it's not sunny you've got to wear your spf so that's my serums on again give it a second to sink in give your products a chance to work their magic before you slap something else on then we're going into moisturizer and two moisturizers on the go at the moment in the evening it's the tolerian taurian the one that i showed you in the morning and the one that i used in the morning or the aurilia cell revitalize night moisturizer this is so deeply nourishing so if you feel like you want that extra hydration to be honest both of them are super super nourishing so it's purely up to you um i love aurilia as you can see it's got that really nice thick consistency so i'm going to apply that one tonight i alternate them um i like to switch my routine around which sometimes doesn't play out well because i end up using something that i got excited about and purchased and it just doesn't suit my skin but it's all trial and error so i'm gonna apply the this one today it smells again amazing everything from aurelia has that element of aromatherapy to it again don't forget about the neck i take about a pea size amount of cream um for the moisturizer and that my friends is it that is me done for the night so i'm gonna leave the creams to do their magic another thing that i use and that i have been enjoying is an led mask you might have seen it in my favorites video mine is from current body so it's an led silicone mask so you just put it on your face like that and then you press the button and the red light therapy starts so i usually do it every other day i just press the button and for 10 minutes i close my eyes and listen to my audio book and do absolutely nothing at all because i can and it's because it's good for me sorry i'm reaching for my lip balm because i can feel how dry my lips are i use elizabeth are then eight hour cream and the led therapy has been fantastic it is fantastic if you have acne if you're fighting fine lines and wrinkles and pretty much any skin concern led light can address of course it is not as strong as you will get in a salon but it is pretty damn good and pretty damn close as far as home uh equipment and home therapies go so i would definitely have a look at the current body one and or there's another one that is very similar that has um similar strength in the light otherwise if you guys have any questions at all please let me know i will leave all the information about all the projects that i have used today in the description box i hope you enjoyed this video and i hope if you do suffer from rosacea that it is not too bad today or tomorrow and i know how frustrating it can be but i wish you all a wonderful day i'm sending you all my love and i hope you are doing well don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you haven't done that yet and i will see you guys very very soon in my next video bye of course only by the end of the video do i realize i've got mascara all over my eyes this is what a wonderful youtuber i am",

        "transcript": "do you have sensitive skin today we're talking about what's up everyone I'm back we're back he's back I'm Dr Shaw Dr Maxfield Dr Shaw welcome back to our Channel Dr Lee where we talk about all things related to skin care and dermatology and today one of the biggest topics ever which is sensitive skin what is it who has it what causes it what products are best for it we're going to be talking about everything related to sensitive skincare and at the end we're going to be building you a routine with products that we recommend for sensitive skin all things sensitive skin here we go here we [Music] go so first question what on Earth is it mean does it mean to have sensitive skin the idea is that you would experience negative symptoms when the majority of other people wouldn't what that looks like is burning stinging itching irritation redness flushing after after exposure to something so that could be either just the subjective feeling of the products being uncomfortable on the skin or it can actually manifest as redness on the skin as well so why do we have sensitive skin why do some people have sensitive skin I think our poster children for this are those with eczema or atopic dermatitis and rosacea these two groups of people people who have these conditions they really struggle to use skinc care they usually struggle on a daily basis with just their Skin Barrier so this is caused by a combination of inflammation and Skin Barrier dysfunction so with atopic deritis they have a baseline levels of inflammation that are always there they have smoldering inflammation underneath the skin the Embers the coals are always hot and it just takes a little bit to push it over the edge and then it's on fire redness stinging itching the other side of it with a Skin Barrier same thing the atopic dermatitis you have decreased ceramides flagin natural moisturizing factor and so the Skin Barrier isn't healthy so not only is there always a fire but the barrier can't keep bad things out and it can't keep good things like moisture in and then you have the general population where you may not have a dedicated condition but there's probably some level of change regarding one of those two things and because a lot of it is subjective more than 50% of people think they have sensitive skin and in some studies up to 80% of people have sensitive skin it's not just hey I feel like I have sensitive skin but they've actually biopsied people's skin and looked at what changes they found in the skin so some people have thinner Skin Barrier some people have decreased ceramide and lipid contents some people have upregulation of different receptors like the tprv one receptor trpv trpv receptor this receptor is just one of many complicated neural connections that our cells talk and communicate with each other but interestingly this in particular is not only on skin cells it's on mass cells it's on multiple parts of our body and activation of this causes itch it's like really involved in the itch pathway but again it's actually also found in the rosacea pathway it's on our our C fibers our C nerve fibers which also transmit pain so this is just one cellular signaling molecule that has its little tendrils across sensitive skin everywhere and when we're looking at products that are meant for sensitive skin or to decrease that irritation or that discomfort that you feel with sensitive skin a lot of them are going to downregulate or calm down these receptors in the skin now when they've done these studies on people who have sensitive skin what they look at is basically stinging and burning when you apply lactic acid or stinging and burning in discomfort when you apply something like capsacin or even some of the more irritating surfactants like SLS right so what they look at this and see if people actually have a reaction to these that's also how they find out whether or not the products are helping to decrease that irritation inflammation and discomfort that you're feeling so if you normally feel irritation when applying lactic acid and then they apply this product and then they apply lactic acid and it decreases that irritation then that's a good sign that this product is helping with people that have sensitive skin basically like your retinol sandwich in a laboratory actually right so how do you take care of sensitive skin well there are a few things you can just simply avoid people with sensitive skin tend to react to these types of things so one would be fragrances two would be essential oils three would be drying alcohols and this is usually not causing barrier issues according to most studies but people with sensitive skin tend to react from a discomfort standpoint when they apply alcohol or drying alcohols to the skin I think I actually I know I more than he talk about products with fragrance in a positive light however my caveat is always this if you have a topic dermatitis rosacea or sensitive skin a product with fragrance is probably not for you uh my rule of thumb is it just doesn't like delete the product entirely it just you may not use it if you have sensitive skin so I think that the phrase is like say less but do less right so like you can actually do less to get an improvement in your skin with this category now when it comes to actives and sensitive skin you do have to be a little bit careful with these so you can use exfoliating acids you just need to really listen to your skin so mandelic acid larger molecule Alpha hydroxy acid may be a better exfoliator for you polyhydroxy acids like gluconolactone those are going to be better exfoliators for you but things that are smaller molecule like glycolic acid are going to tend to sting and burn in people who have sensitive skin so you may want to avoid those yeah you may not be able to use the most effective ingredient in your skincare routine retinoids included but you might be able to be consistent with a less effective one and still get great results now let's build you a routine for sensitive skin believe it or not there's actually an incredible amount of data on sensitive skin and products that help with sensitive skin so we did a deep dive on this and we actually looked for products that have these ingredients that tend to calm and Soo the skin and people who have that abnormal reaction to products so first starting out cleansers now cleansers are always going to be the most irritating part of your skincare routine they are removing dirt and debris from your skin at the same time they can be disrupting to your skin barriers so you want to look for gentle cleansers now your gentle hydr and cleansers tend to be good in this category cavey has one Cetaphil has one vany cream has one now Neutrogena has a gel foaming cleanser which is a larger molecule of surfactin in it and they've actually done studies on it that show that it decreases transepidermal water loss so if you like that foaming sensation then you can go with this Neutrogena gel foaming cleanser and still have that protected Skin Barrier I washed my face with this right before the video just because I have it right so he's like oh we got to get talk about this one it's like okay let's use it and yeah the subjective experience it was good didn't feel stripped I think Neutrogena Pink PHA cleanser um so that's a way to sneak in a light exfoliant polyhydroxy acids into your skincare routine while really minimizing the risk of irritation now again with cleansers you really just want to be gentle in this step you don't want to be taking one step forward and one step back with the rest of your products now you've picked your cleanser and you have to go onto the treatment phase now there's not a lot of good treatments for sensitive skin because you're really just trying to calm down the skin you're trying to avoid that irritation there are a few ingredients that we found while deep diving that actually do tend to offset that irritation in people that have upregulated trpv1 receptors so if you have this issue there are a few things you can do now as far as treatments and serums and moisturizers these kind of overlap into each other because a lot of the moisturizers are going to end up being treatments for people who have sensitive skin but serums that we do like would be things with the bifa ferment lysate in them now this is a probiotic um that you can find in a few products out there uh comes in serum form but has actually been shown to help with people that have sensitive skin yeah probiotics I did a huge Deep dive no one cared prob the most time I've ever done on a deep dive I cared he cared two people commented and cared but the uh nzen serum skin softening serum this is number three I was super excited that this came up I actually have fallen in love with this brand this year and last last year I actually did a live and I was like oh yeah there's this Korean skincare brand I love I don't know the name they're great this was what I was talking about but it's number three serum it has a extremely high concentration of this probiotic it's like the number one ingredient in the product list everything else is complimenting and soothing has a good amount of body subjectively I'm obsessed I think it's outstanding the poster child for this ingredient is actually the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum they're the ones that pretty much did all the studies on this ingredient showing that it helps to calm and sooe the skin and I wanted to hate that product because it it's one of those like Heritage products that's been on the market forever it's actually fragrance-free and I actually loved it when I used it the biggest Pitfall of this product is that it's super expensive it's closer to that $100 range so for me it's hard for me to always recommend it but it actually is a really nice product with actually a lot of data and they have a patented peptide that's part of this formula but but specifically it does this have this Bita of ferment extract that's been shown to be helpful for people with sensitive skin now you don't need to to use multiple serums honestly if you have sensitive skin less is more so just pick one of these another type of serum that you could look for is something with seea or cantella in it yeah the one that I've Loved this year is the seea serum from karx it is again it's the number one ingredient in multiple different forms sella Cella Cella and that's what you're wanting something very simple stripped down again for a serum has really good body I broke his rule I'm wearing both of the serums we've already talked about on my skin right now after I cleansed my face so excellent product I would even be new this year but one of my goats a high concentration of seea cantella maasti side this is going to be something that's definitely be calming and soothing for the skin now we're going to go on to just moisturizers after this but if you do want to use a hyaluronic acid serum there's good evidence to suggest that low molecular weight hyaluronic acid serums can be pro-inflammatory so they're not going to be great for people with sensitive skin you want to look for a high molecular weight hyaluronic acid product the vich mineral 89 is over 1,000 Kil adul and it's going to be the probably the best type of hyaluronic acid for sensitive skin now is this a necessary step in someone who has sensitive skin I would say no but if you did want one I would say the VC mineral 89 would be a good choice here now let's talk about my favorite category of products moisturizers when it comes to moisturizers you have different Vehicles right so like you have your gels your lotions your creams your ointments and there's now a lot of overlap so it can be difficult but what you're really wanting is something that is hydrating somewhat inclusive like whatever your preference is like some people hate the feel of something thick some people like something light that's fine just make it work another tip apply it to damp skin this is going to help lock in some more moisture it's going to help elevate your whole thing the other part of this is the individual ingredients in your moisturizers so we said no fragrance that's fine you can look for things like the sool panol dth con really is helpful but not as helpful as petrolatum and then you have individual ingredients like colloidal oatmeal and that's where I'm going to land right now this was a year of oats and it kind of I don't know if it went on noticed or not but a lot of Brands were coming out with oat products this year I was excited some of the best were aino has a good oat product it's it's actual oats it's not Cal oatmeal Cal oatmeal is regulated mad has an excellent oat balm so for someone who's looking for oats one of the most evidence-based plant ingredients in all of skincare mad balm is a great option for that sensitive skin right so this has that 5% collidal oatmeal which is actually approved for eczema proved to treat eczema it's approved as a skin protectant by the FDA so this is something that is actually clinically proven to be helpful for more of that eczema type skin now other ingredients and this is a part that I'm pretty excited about other ingredients that actually have been shown to help with sensitive skin that means the discomfort like they show people that get discomfort when they apply products and then they tried these ingredients on people to see if it actually helped with that discomfort now there are two in this category that you have probably never heard of because no one ever talks about them so first is 4T be cyclohexanol this has actually been shown to decrease sensitive skin and this is found in only a select few products but I found it in the userin redness relief line or their anti-redness line so we'll show the product here but this is super interesting this is of course a fragrance-free product but it has this ingredient that can really help Cal and suit the skin and next up is something that we talked about in our first product review ever so 3 years later we get to Circle back and talk about this product again of course this one is from L Ro POS which means that they've changed the name of it in the last three years because it wouldn't be L Ro POS if they didn't change the names on us so this used to be called the L Ro P tarian Ultra this is now called L Ro P tarian Derm allergo now this product was essentially formulated only for sensitive skin it contains an ingredient called neurosensine also known as acetal dipeptide 1 this product again has been shown to help with sensitive skin and what we love about this product and what some people hate about this product is that it's in a hermetically sealed packaging so this is airless hermetically sealed and it doesn't have any preservatives either so this is really formulated for people that get that burning stinging sensation when they apply products my wife's skin cartin is slowly coming out she has the most sensitive vascular arithat tangc ttic rosacea skin she tolerates nothing this is a staple in her routine but back when we couldn't afford this product we were like budgeting to buy this product because it was that good I remember how much it hurt to buy this product my one knock on this again name change yes also the pump I think there's been three times it just breaks like it just doesn't work and then we're left with popping it open and trying to get out what we can of this Liquid Gold um in my opinion it is a little expensive for a moisturizer for the volume um but again I think the value is there I think it's an incredibly incredibly gentle and novel unique facial moisturizer and this is a product that my wife actually uses as well she also has sensitive skin especially around her eyes lately believe it or not like me probably my fault somehow but she also loves this product so this product is incredible it's actually withed the test of time we're talking about it 3 years later which you know crazy consistency I would say we uh we keep it going so last we have to talk about sunscreen that's the protect step of your skincare routine in the morning critical cuz we do know that with sun exposure it upregulates vascular growth factors that make rosacea worse it makes sensitive skin worse it causes your barrier to be dysfunctional sunscreen critical step in your skincare routine in my patients I do find that your mineral sunscreens tend to be better for sensitive skin they cause less allergy and they cause less burning when you apply them yeah my experience as well like just because of my lifestyle sunscreens run in my eyes and I am always strictly looking for a zinc based sunscreen if I know that's going to be a problem for me right if not chemical sunscreens are fine by us a vany cream has a mineral sunscreen that is SPF 30 it's great product it Blends really really well some people might not love it but it's a great product we discovered it this year so we're actually pretty pumped about it other than that I would say if you're somebody who doesn't want to learn about all these ingredients doesn't want to learn about what to avoid just simply wants to know what skincare line do I buy if I have sensitive skin now I would say probably overall at all the brands that I looked at vany cream is probably the best formulated skincare line for sensitive skin they have the most strict ingredient guidelines when formulating products and they tend to be a safe bet I I don't think I found a vanny cream product that I don't like for sensitive skin and then second up I would say would be cavey a little less strict in their guidelines but I still also don't know of any products other than maybe their hyaluronic acid product that tends to not be great for sensitive skin yeah I think that's fair there's a reason I think dermatologists are hyper aware hyper sensitive to sensitive skin like it's the world we live in patients see us when things go wrong with their skin anytime there's a problem it's us and also there's a reason that vanac cream and cavey are always in a dermatologist pocket repertoire we can make generalizable recommendations people do need Simplicity life's crazy what's the one brand I can go look for at this store get Cy like get a Cy moisturizer you're probably going to be safe if I was not a dermatologist by training I don't know that I would know nearly anything about what to avoid in skincare products nor do I know that I would find a passion for it so so I I totally understand that people just want to know hey what do I buy I just want better skin and people want Simplicity we understand that we see it in our comments we see it in our patients um and so we totally understand the these are the two lines that I would look for again sunscreen is going to be critical to all of this the routine is going to be in the description so make sure that you download that routine people always give us really positive feedback on these handouts that we give so this is going to summarize the routine what products we recommend and what to avoid thank you all so much for tuning in please like comment and subscribe and we will see you in the next video we'll see you next time",

journey i'm going to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 skin condition which i have been suffering from\u00a0\nlast 15 years which is called rojasia i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to divide this video into different categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there lastly\u00a0\nbefore i go i want to say please be kind to others\u00a0\u00a0 be considerate to people who are suffering from\u00a0\nskin condition before you ask someone about their\u00a0\u00a0 face please think how you would feel if you were\u00a0\nin their shoes i feel like social media is also\u00a0\u00a0 to blame so we are conditioned to think everybody\u00a0\nneeds to have a beautiful skin you always see\u00a0\u00a0 like edited pictures flawless skin clear skin\u00a0\nin real life we have pores we have breakouts\u00a0\u00a0 we have pigmentation nobody has that porcelain\u00a0\nskin or baby like skin still today even though\u00a0\u00a0 i have a clear skin i don't have like a perfect\u00a0\nskin i feel like it is so important to normalize\u00a0\u00a0 skin conditions we need to have open dialogue\u00a0\nand open conversation in social media that is\u00a0\u00a0 how i feel anybody suffering with skin\u00a0\ncondition acne pigmentation or any sort\u00a0\u00a0 of skin condition please be kind to yourself\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching this video once\u00a0\u00a0 again and i hope you found this video helpful\u00a0\nand i'll see you guys on my next video if you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't subscribed please do i love to have\u00a0\nyou on my channel till then take care bye guys",

H: I try to think about it\u00a0\nlike does this ingredient\u00a0\u00a0 give back to my skin or does it take from it M: what are some of your\u00a0\nfavorites for calming down\u00a0\u00a0 irritated skin and supporting your skin barrier? H: panthenol glycerin and hyaluronic acid so\u00a0\nthose are hydrating panthenol's a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 soothing as well niacinamide everyone's fave\u00a0\nbut not too much like five percent not 10 or 20 and then there's barrier support so we\u00a0\nhave ceramides cholesterol or you might\u00a0\u00a0 see phytosphingosine so that's a lipid\u00a0\nyou find in the outer layer of your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and it helps to give back to your skin\u00a0\nthose lipids that it's mainly missing then we have soothing ingredients so my faves\u00a0\u00a0 are definitely oat and also centella so\u00a0\n\"cica\" madecassoside and copper peptide M: so moving on to specific products I don't know if I told you this but your\u00a0\nserum actually made me realize how there\u00a0\u00a0 were lots of actives for irritated skin because\u00a0\nI used your serum and it was lovely on my skin and then I looked at the ingredients\u00a0\nlist and there was so much stuff in there so side note I did not invite Hannah onto this\u00a0\nvideo because she's my friend and I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 plug her serum we are going to talk about other\u00a0\nproducts but this was like a revelation to me so the serum is water-based and most of the\u00a0\ntime water-based serums really sting when my\u00a0\u00a0 skin barrier is compromised and this did not\u00a0\nit just felt so lovely so my mind was blown H: I feel like the oat is doing\u00a0\na lot of the lifting there my skin was stressed out while we were\u00a0\nworking on it so it was good for me to\u00a0\u00a0 test but what I wanted was something\u00a0\nthat would feel calming on contact I definitely did feel like there was a gap\u00a0\nthat was not much you could get especially\u00a0\u00a0 in Australia that would hydrate calm and support\u00a0\nyour barrier that didn't feel like thick and balmy M: I really love how lightweight\u00a0\nit is and how well it layers and\u00a0\u00a0 like just the fact that there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market I've been using this a few times\u00a0\na week even when my skin isn't\u00a0\u00a0 that irritated because it just\u00a0\nfits into my routine so nicely M: what are your other favorite\u00a0\nproducts for when your skin's irritated? H: I really like the la roche\u00a0\nposay cicaplast sheet masks you\u00a0\u00a0 put it on your face and it just\u00a0\nfeels calm it's hydrated it's\u00a0\u00a0 the best even after treatments you\u00a0\nknow when your skin feels really hot M: so I personally just don't really enjoy sheet\u00a0\nmasks because I don't like the feeling of them\u00a0\u00a0 sliding down my face so I love the cicaplast baume\u00a0\nB5 which is getting reformulated to the B5 plus I picked up one up in Europe and so far\u00a0\nit seems to be pretty similar on my skin\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a little bit lighter but I have\u00a0\nheard different things from other people a lot of people have told me that they really\u00a0\u00a0 like the cicaplast serum as well but I\u00a0\nhaven't tried that enough to really say there are a lot of other centella products that\u00a0\nare formulated for this sort of skin recovery\u00a0\u00a0 phase as well from brands like bioderma\u00a0\nand there's quite a few in K Beauty too H: I quite like NIOD's copper\u00a0\npeptide but the lipid which is\u00a0\u00a0 a sort of gel it's great because\u00a0\nsort of a one and done PM routine Beauty Bay make this moisturizer that's oat\u00a0\u00a0 it's called Thirst Class it's kind of a\u00a0\nbit richer so I would use it in winter M: yeah I think oat is just really underrated I\u00a0\nused to make this DIY oat mask back in the day\u00a0\u00a0 that was just ground up oatmeal mixed with\u00a0\nwater and I would just slap it on my skin it has a lot of hydrating actives and\u00a0\navenanthramides which are really soothing H: if you're fancy the Cosmetics\u00a0\n27 baume 27 which is sort of like\u00a0\u00a0 a healing oil balm really beautiful it\u00a0\nhas essential oils but they're chamomile\u00a0\u00a0 calendula those calming ones not the\u00a0\nhectic lavender or anything like that laneige cream skin beautiful\u00a0\ndoesn't have many ingredients M: I really love that one too\u00a0\nit's really lightweight and\u00a0\u00a0 less ingredients just cuts down\u00a0\nthat chance of skin reactions along the same lines with less\u00a0\ningredients but a bit heavier\u00a0\u00a0 there's also Vaseline and Aquaphor\u00a0\nwhich is mostly just petroleum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 and they're water free so there's\u00a0\nlike a lot less chance of stinging there's also CeraVe healing ointment\u00a0\nand the QV sting free ointment which\u00a0\u00a0 is like the Australian version of that\u00a0\nand they both have ceramides in them too I also really like using face oils\u00a0\nwhen I have that compromised skin\u00a0\u00a0 barrier because of the lack of water\u00a0\nit just doesn't tend to sting as much H: the paula's choice advanced\u00a0\nreplenishing toner I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 reminds me of laneige cream skin only\u00a0\nit's packed with antioxidants as well\u00a0\u00a0 so it can almost be your am serum\u00a0\nif you want a bunch of antioxidants I quite like my LED mask as well so I\u00a0\nhave one that's red and near infrared I\u00a0\u00a0 find when I use it regularly my skin is just\u00a0\nmore resilient and can tolerate more things I get a little bit tired in\u00a0\nthe evening so you just put\u00a0\u00a0 it on and then you've done skincare\u00a0\nand it's one less layer on your face M: I mentioned before that you have to avoid\u00a0\nretinoids exfoliants and vitamin C but there\u00a0\u00a0 are gentler versions of those so what is your\u00a0\npolicy on using these when your skin's irritated? H: it really depends for me on how irritated my\u00a0\u00a0 skin is but but I do have some\u00a0\ngentler versions of my actives la roche C10 is an example that\u00a0\none has 10% vitamin C but also\u00a0\u00a0 their neurosensine peptide and a\u00a0\nbit of salicylic acid so I have\u00a0\u00a0 literally never had an issue with that\u00a0\nproduct and I have issues with vitamin C and if I wanted a retinoid the kiehls\u00a0\nmicrodose it's enough to have an effect\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not enough to cause any issues so\u00a0\nthat's also a perfect beginner retinoid in\u00a0\u00a0 general and it has ceramides to\u00a0\nreplenish your skin as it works M: I also really like using derivatives of\u00a0\nvitamin C and A where my skin's irritated\u00a0\u00a0 because while there is less evidence\u00a0\nfor them working they are a lot gentler which I guess could be because they're not working\u00a0\nas well but it is like a nice fallback option my favorite less irritating derivatives for\u00a0\nvitamin C are ascorbyl glucoside magnesium\u00a0\u00a0 ascorbyl phosphate and thda or\u00a0\natip which are the same thing and for vitamin A I like granactive retinoid for gentle chemical exfoliation I like\u00a0\nusing polyhydroxy acids although I do\u00a0\u00a0 also sometimes use a very small amount of\u00a0\nsalicylic acid since it can be soothing but\u00a0\u00a0 you do have to be pretty careful because\u00a0\na lot of the formulas are quite harsh M: so one question I get asked a lot is\u00a0\nhow long do you generally have to wait\u00a0\u00a0 for your barrier to fix itself before\u00a0\nyou can go back to your usual products H: I am getting pretty good at repairing mine\u00a0\u00a0 and recognizing the signs before I\u00a0\ntruly obliterate it so a week or two recently I had a facial where it was an enzyme\u00a0\nexfoliant and it was like a bit scrubby and\u00a0\u00a0 I felt a bit tingly around the mouth I\u00a0\nthought it would be fine it wasn't fine the next few days it was tingly and so I\u00a0\njust cut the actives for about two weeks previous times has taken me three months M: that is so long yeah I think it is just a lot easier to not\u00a0\nmess up your skin barrier in the first place the longest my skin has taken is probably a week\u00a0\u00a0 or two but it depends a lot\u00a0\non the type of irritation so with perioral dermatitis\u00a0\nusually that is maybe a day or two if my nose is peeling off after a cold\u00a0\nthen that will usually be over a week now with cleansers which ones\u00a0\ndo you like for irritated skin? H: I like to use fragrance free cleanses and\u00a0\nit's because if your barrier is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 compromised then things get in further and so\u00a0\nthey wouldn't normally irritate you but they can I like avene extremely gentle cleanser\u00a0\nI like biologique recherche lait u that\u00a0\u00a0 is the one that's for oily skin but it's a cream and I like a really soft washcloth so like\u00a0\nthat really flammable fluffy polyester M: I also like fragrance free\u00a0\ncleansers where my skin's irritated some of my favorites are from geek\u00a0\nand gorgeous hada labo and bondi sands all of those don't really strip\u00a0\nskin and like you said they have\u00a0\u00a0 moisturising ingredients\u00a0\nthat give back to the skin I also really like using bioderma micellar\u00a0\nwater with soft reusable cotton rounds the bioderma was specifically designed and tested\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin and reusable\u00a0\ncotton rounds are just really soft M: now we are Australians so of course\u00a0\nwe have to talk about sun protection what is your approach when your skin's irritated? H: there are a couple of sunscreens\u00a0\nI know not to use because I can feel\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit spicy on the cheeks if my\u00a0\nskin is irritated but generally I will\u00a0\u00a0 look for one that is formulated for sensitive skin I really like those European pharmacy\u00a0\nbrands ends that cater to this type of skin M: yeah I think there is this sort of\u00a0\nassumption that you have to use zinc\u00a0\u00a0 oxide if your skin's irritated but\u00a0\nsometimes that's not the best option\u00a0\u00a0 and newer sunscreen filters\u00a0\ncan be really non-irritating if you go into like a French pharmacy\u00a0\nyou'll see that all of their sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin sunscreens are actually all chemical\u00a0\nsunscreens they have those newer filters some people actually find zinc oxide\u00a0\nmore irritating because it is drying\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite irritating when you're\u00a0\nrubbing it in because it's so thick\u00a0\u00a0 and sticky and also just trying to\u00a0\nget it off with cleanser at the end on top of that they're not always truly free\u00a0\nfrom chemical sunscreens I've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this before but there are these SPF boosters\u00a0\nthat are in a lot of mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\u00a0 they have almost identical properties to a\u00a0\nlot of properly approved chemical sunscreens I've actually talked to quite a few\u00a0\npeople now who have told me that they\u00a0\u00a0 react to some mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\nnot others and then they checked and\u00a0\u00a0 they saw that the ones that they do\u00a0\nreact to have butyloctyl salicylate M: right what other tips and tricks\u00a0\ndo you have for irritated skin? H: I think a lot of people don't know\u00a0\nthat your skin it exfoliates itself right it's called desquamation and it does that\u00a0\nbetter when it is adequately hydrated so\u00a0\u00a0 I would always try to hydrate my\u00a0\nskin before I try to exfoliate it if it's flaking or something\u00a0\nlike that and you might find\u00a0\u00a0 that the flakes take care of themselves that way I also really like doing several\u00a0\nlayers of one toner putting several\u00a0\u00a0 layers of one product on is better\u00a0\nthan putting four or five different\u00a0\u00a0 products right less opportunity\u00a0\nto upset your skin freak it out M: I also find that with flaky skin\u00a0\nif I have to get rid of them before\u00a0\u00a0 putting on makeup then I will wet my\u00a0\nskin and use a peeling gel very very\u00a0\u00a0 carefully and just buff in tiny circles\u00a0\nand that seems to do the least damage but that is like a really emergency sort\u00a0\nof thing I wouldn't recommend doing that\u00a0\u00a0 regularly when your skin is compromised because\u00a0\nthe hydration technique is just so much safer M: you also gave me some really good tips for\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis which is a newer issue for me it's a red rash that comes up around\u00a0\nyour mouth and near the sides of your\u00a0\u00a0 nose and it's been coming up\u00a0\nmore because of mask wearing the extra humidity can lead to an impaired barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and imbalance microbes and that can\u00a0\ncontribute to perioral dermatitis so I've had to change a few things when it flares\u00a0\u00a0 up like adding a cleanser in the\u00a0\nmorning which I don't usually do when my skin is happy then extra\u00a0\ncleansing tends to mess it up more\u00a0\u00a0 and dehydrate my skin but when that\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis is flaring then\u00a0\u00a0 my skin's already messed up so cleansing\u00a0\nactually takes it back towards happy M: do you have any other tips? H: if you think it might be perioral\u00a0\ndermatitis never put steroids on it\u00a0\u00a0 that's a Dr Cara-ism it's my beloved dermatologist perioral dermatitis it's like imbalanced\u00a0\nmicrobiome but also it can happen from\u00a0\u00a0 steroid withdrawal because the steroids\u00a0\nput your immune system to sleep a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit your immune system was there sort\u00a0\nof keeping the microbiome in check M: speaking of microbiome I found that I\u00a0\nsometimes get very superficial folliculitis\u00a0\u00a0 on my body when my skin gets irritated\u00a0\nso like after exercising and I'm sweaty\u00a0\u00a0 and my clothes have been rubbing in my\u00a0\narmpits and in like my crotchal region and it's usually worse when I'm a bit\u00a0\nrun down from stress and lack of sleep basically this is when bacteria infect your hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles and you get red bumps with pus\u00a0\nthat look like shallow inflamed pimples for these I like to use a benzoyl\u00a0\nperoxide cleanser most of these are\u00a0\u00a0 meant for the face but dermatologists have been\u00a0\u00a0 recommending it for body folliculitis too\u00a0\nand it's been working really well for me I use it right after I exercise\u00a0\nand also when I'm having a flare\u00a0\u00a0 and just also not marinating\u00a0\nin sweaty clothes helps a lot but if it's really deep and painful\u00a0\nand not going away then definitely see\u00a0\u00a0 a doctor because you might need antibiotics or\u00a0\nsomething or it could be just not folliculitis M: now rosacea I get asked about this a lot and\u00a0\u00a0 it's a bit of a confusing condition\u00a0\nthat not a lot of people talk about so what is rosacea? H: rosacea is a chronic inflammatory\u00a0\nskin condition it's basically my\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist explained it to me as it's the blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels that are inflamed not the\u00a0\npores like you would have in acne you'll see visible blood vessels so those\u00a0\nlittle red ones are called telangiectasias\u00a0\u00a0 redness flushing so you'll see a symmetrical\u00a0\npattern of redness so mine comes and goes so you might get sort of a pimple like bump but it\u00a0\u00a0 won't be in the t-zone it will be around\u00a0\nthe cheeks and the nose in this pattern so it's like w zone not t-zone M: it gets confused a lot with acne and it\u00a0\ntends to show up from your late 20s onwards M: so how did you first\u00a0\nsuspect that you had rosacea? H: I was at an event and Dr Dennis\u00a0\nwas there and I said \"you know what\u00a0\u00a0 I'm always like flushing pink and red\u00a0\nthrough here sometimes through my cheeks what's going on? is that something I can treat?\" he's like \"well that's rosacea\" and I\u00a0\nwas like \"see ya\" I didn't want to know M: why should you actually\u00a0\nlook into managing rosacea? H: the thing about rosacea is that it progresses so you'll start with just the pink\u00a0\nand the flushing and maybe some\u00a0\u00a0 visible blood vessels around the nose\u00a0\nyou can get them in your cheeks too and then you'll start to get lesions\u00a0\nand you can also have it get into your\u00a0\u00a0 eyes and then it can progress\u00a0\nto thickened skin and swelling M: in terms of treating rosacea there\u00a0\nare over-the-counter options like\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid you should also\u00a0\nsee a dermatologist who has\u00a0\u00a0 experience with treating rosacea and\u00a0\nthey'll have other options available how else do you manage rosacea? H: Keeping on top of your skin barrier\u00a0\nand keeping that in check in place,\u00a0\u00a0 really supporting it is number one And avoiding triggers so you'll notice\u00a0\nwhen you start to flush from certain things the sun is a big one my skin hates the indoor heating - hates it alcohol some foods even spicy food is a big one\u00a0\u00a0 especially for like pale people\u00a0\nthat only eat meat and vegetables some medicines even do it your\u00a0\nskin care or makeup could do it M: I feel like in the skincare community we\u00a0\ntalk so much about acne but nowhere near as\u00a0\u00a0 much about rosacea so if any of this is\u00a0\nsounding familiar then you might want\u00a0\u00a0 to read up a bit on rosacea and\u00a0\nconsider getting it checked out I'll put some more resources in the\u00a0\ncaption and keep in mind that if you\u00a0\u00a0 have darker skin the redness will be harder to see I hope you enjoyed this nerdy chat if you did like the video to train the YouTube\u00a0\nalgorithm to give you more content like this also share any tips you have and leave\u00a0\nquestions for Hannah in the comments you can follow Hannah here she's also\u00a0\nwritten a great book and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 how much I'm getting out of it from all of my tabs I also have an ebook on skincare and I hope\u00a0\nthis video helps your skin be less grumpy at you",

        "transcript": "the three best products from the ordinary for rosacea prone skin if you do have rosacea it can be very difficult to find products that work well rosacea naturally is much more sensitive than even dry skin or sensitive skin and there's a lot of different things that can trigger rosacea such as eating spicy foods drinking alcohol or even going out into the Sun rosacea is primarily a vascular condition meaning the little blood capillaries that are naturally in your face are at the root cause for why this flares up for some people and although it's normally this redness in the cheeks rosacea can have pimples it's not the same thing as acne but they can look like acne and it is possible to have both rosacea and acne together these are the three best products from an ingredient perspective that should be okay for rosacea prone skin and that have the actives that have the potential to help and the first one actually mimics what dermatologists prescribe this is the salic acid ten percent in silicone and as a liqu acid is a really cool ingredient you may be familiar with other skincare acids however this one is much more gentle and for rosacea prone skin it can help dermatologists actually prescribe a 15-percent as they like acid solution for some patients with rosacea you can't get that over the counter it's too high of a percentage to get without prescription but this is at 10% and you can find other solutions that have 5% etc this helps with the redness of rosacea but it also helps if you do get those little white pustules those pimple like looking things and azalea kasih does also help with acne in case you have both as the oleic acid can burn a little bit when being put on the skin so do be aware of that but it is one of the ingredients that once the skin builds up tolerance to it can actually help to protect your skin a little bit more over the long run meaning that rosacea prone skin is less likely to flare up from other ingredients being used somewhere down the line because this is an a dimethicone base it's really nice and smooth onto the skin kind of like a primer the only things that it can ball up if you go at it too aggressively so I would recommend starting by patting it on the other thing is that as a liqu acid can be used day and night no problem dr. Sam is a dermatologist that I love and admire and she has used azalea Cassatt on pregnant and nursing patients for those who are pregnant earners it's hard to find skincare that is safe for both you and your baby so it's nice that this is an option and the other thing is that it's fairly unreactive so it's generally okay to use with most other things in a routine because of its silicone base it does work best after your serums either as a step before your moisturizers are kind of in place of your moisturizer or before your sunscreen since it has that silicone butt next you do have to consider sunscreen yes sunscreen can be used to help combat rosacea and the reason why is because the Sun is one of the major flares we see rosacea being vascular can be triggered by a lot of things but most people who suffer from it say that sun exposure is a big one sunscreen and the prevention of the UV rays from damaging those delicate little capillaries inside of the skin is really important not only to prevent it from flaring but to actually keep it under control and down regulate the steps that are already happening in your skin this is a mineral sunscreen from the ordinary I really love this one a lot of people have sensitivities to some of the chemical ingredients in sunscreen a lot of those are things like a boban zone oxybenzone octinoxate Homo say late those are not necessarily bad things however for people with sensitive skin they can be stinging they can be irritating and especially for people with rosacea prone skin the skin is already hypersensitive so you don't want to offend it more this sunscreen is an SPF 30 it's a great option that you could put on in the morning and the other thing is that it does have some other ingredients in here such as urea and such as Alan toen we've spoken about these ingredients before on this channel but as a little reminder these are both very soothing to the skin specifically urea can be helpful and Alan toen has been known to be anti-inflammatory which if you're having a rosacea flare-up would be very useful because we're talking about redness you know that this includes a recommendation for the niacinamide and zinc 10% this is really one of the best solutions that the ordinary has when it comes to large pores oiliness and redness and seeing as rosacea is this redness condition this vascular condition this is a really great place to start niacin amide otherwise known as b3 is a water-soluble vitamin and it really can do amazing things for the skin in combination with the zinc it helps to not only stabilize this but really target the areas of the skin that are experiencing that redness it take a little bit of time and some people have noticed that their skin kind of purges which means it gets a little bit worse before it gets better on initial application of this but especially for those who are struggling from rosacea that has the little white pustules or if you have rosacea and acne in combination this can help to down-regulate your skin's natural oil production so bye-bye grease that could be contributing to some of that and on top of that down regulate the redness that is normally associated with those flushes and those flares total transparency if your rosacea is really bad none of these products are gonna work once you get past kind of a critical point you really do have to go see a dermatologist and get a prescription or make sure it is rosacea and it's not acne in disguise there are also other types of redness in the skin such as erythema that are different than rosacea and need to be approached differently but lucky for you we have a whole bunch of guides on how to use the ordinary products as well as deep dives into basic ingredients and different skin conditions so that you can understand how to be a conscious consumer how to turn and learn your ingredient labels figure out what's in there and work with your healthcare team in order to treat and overall embrace and understand your skin if you learn something here make sure that you that like button and don't forget to brush that's subscribe button if you haven't already more videos can be found right here and I cannot wait to see you beautiful bunch of lies in the next video love you guys bye",

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and number two for working with us on this video as well as helping make this rosacea education and information possible but remember this is not medical information that's for your doctor to give you do remember to reapply your spf especially if you have rosacea and always remember to be youtiful both inside and out i love you beautiful butterflies and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye you",

        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "well hey everybody welcome back to skincare with Chris Gibson if you're new I'm Chris I am your skincare expert I'm here to help you get your best skin ever and on this channel we talked about skin care products skin care routines skin care problems and today we're talking about rosacea and what products you can use to help combat that problem so if that's your thing please hit the subscribe button and the little notification bell so that you get notified when my new videos are up okay so finding skin care products actually will work when you have rosacea is a really tough go especially when you're talking about face washes and sunscreens anything that has chemical components because and I know you know this or you wouldn't have clicked on this video rosacea gives you a very sensitive skin most people think it's just redness but it's very very sensitive skin so it's my goal that by the end of this video you have some products that you can choose from and trust that will help you calm and reduce and soothe rosacea outbreaks or episodes all of the products I'm going to talk about today are in the video description box below and they are dermatologist approved and they can really really help now just like acne which I talked about on this channel incessantly I know since I have such a personal history with that rosacea is along with eczema and flama Torrey disease of the skin a lot of the same things that can trigger acne actually trigger rosacea and eczema so things like food things like skin care ingredients things like stress all can make these episodes and flare-ups happen so having the right skin care products and routine in place can really go a long way to keep flare-ups at bay and the really good news is that the products I'm going to talk about today they are so inexpensive okay first up at any routine of course is cleanser it's very very important that you use a cleanser that is not over drying and irritating Aveeno has an ultra calming face wash that's very good for rosacea it's a very mild formulation it's water based and it's infused with a botanical feverfew which has been shown to reduce redness and inflammation so it's a very calming face wash the other great thing is that it's fragrance free which is really really important when you have any kind of skin condition because fragrance can read really irritate your skin so this one is water-based fragrance free and will not strip your skin of the natural oil that it needs to be healthy it's also great at removing makeup for those of you who wear it so this makes an excellent choice for a cleanser for rosacea next up is moisturizer of course and moisturizer can really be a troublesome thing when you have rosacea because a lot of the common ingredients in skincare products are very irritating to this condition la roche-posay has a really wonderful moisturizers are called tolerate double repair face moisturizer it is also water and glycerin based it also has niacinamide which is really good for reducing inflammation and redness it also has ceramides which help your skin rebuild its actual structure and help it hold in moisture now if you're someone who has a lot of redness with your rosacea you really going to love this next product a Veen brand has an anti bred day soothing cream this is a really great light product formulation that also has a tint of green to it so that it automatically erases the red tones that rosacea produces now one of the best times to treat rosacea is at night when your skin is in its natural repair cycle and for a night moisturizer different brand which you've probably heard of before because they are the ones that have the different gel for acne which is a deplane well they have a night restorative cream that you can use or a night moisturizer it has hyaluronic acid ceramides in a lantern to help improve your skin's texture overnight so again while your skin is in that sleep repair cycle this particular product is going to deeply moisturize and heal your skin and just so we know how this all works ceramides are really important ingredient in that they are lipids that attach themselves to the skin help repair the skin structure retain moisture without irritation hyaluronic acid is a really important ingredient because it's part of your skin's natural structure abduct your skin already produces it it's super super hydrating and it really does help with cellular turnover and a lanten sounds like I'm saying Aladdin but it is kind of a magical ingredient it's made from the root of comfrey you've probably heard of comfrey tea as an herb it is able to soothe irritated skin and it actually helps the skin produce new tissue so again this Euler formulation for a night cream is a really superb choice now a lot of folks with rosacea have a very difficult time tolerating any kind of a serum because of the concentrated nature of the ingredients now la roche-posay has a very light anti redness reducing serum which is a very very well formulated product in fact it is so light it's really more like an essence spray but it too has red tone reducing ingredients that will take the redness out of rosacea without irritating your skin now another product that is super hard for people with rosacea to find that will work for them is sunscreen Cetaphil has a specially formulated moisturizer with an SPF of 30 and the great thing about this moisturizer is that it's mineral based and not chemical because it's the chemicals in sunscreen that can really trigger rosacea flare-ups them you guys who have it know what I'm talking about so this particular moisturizer and it's very inexpensive can be used as a sunscreen so you're gonna be totally protected without irritating your skin and it has caffeine and a lanten in it as well that will help reduce redness while it protects your skin from the ultraviolet and UVB UVA rays all of that now all of these products together can give you a really superb skin care routine that's gonna allow you to use products that won't irritate or trigger an episode of your rosacea and yet let you get the really great benefits of good skin care now I hope this video today helps you figure out some products that can really help you out with your rosacea please in the comments below let me know what your top skincare concern is because if I haven't made a video on it I probably will thank you guys so much for watching and supporting the channel I can't tell you how much it means to me please stay well stay beautiful and I will see you guys over on the next video",

        "transcript": "Hi how are you another rosacea video today and I thought we could go into what needs to be in your everyday routine if you're managing redness or Rosa just a quick reminder because sometimes with Rosa videos I find that they reach people that maybe haven't met me before I'm Rose I'm a beauty journalist I was diagnosed with Rosa six years ago and everything I share in these Rosa videos is information that consultant dermatologists have told me I'm not going to mention specific products today I want to give you um rules and ideas of what to use so for example like moisturizer is going to be one of them and looking for a moisturizer that helps to strengthen the Skin Barrier I will do separate videos with product recommendations but the reason I wanted to do something neutral today largely is so that if I'm mentioning something that you can't get for whatever reason maybe is out of your budget you don't like the brand whatever the criteria could be this is more to tell you what should sit in your routines that you can do your own research and find things that work for you so all of that said let's talk about your routine the great thing about redness and Rose ASA is that the simplest routines are actually the most effective in helping to manage it so all I would recommend in the first instance for you is a great cleanser twice a day a great moisturizer twice a day and an SF from here it can be really helpful to incorporate a treatment stick so for me for example I've got type one and type two rosacea so I have persistent flushing and then I also sometimes have red texture and bumps um it kind of looks a bit like spots it can be confused with spots but how you would know that texture is more of a rosacea texture than an acne texture is that acne spots tend to come to a head whether that's a white head or a black head whereas rosacea spots tend to be just angry red bumps so for me my treatment step that works really well for me is azelaic acid that's a really great ingredient to help reduce the appearance of that redness and I find with the right strength aalc acid I can see a reduction in texture in literally a matter of days so even though that would maybe be your next step it would be something that I would really recommend if you're particularly struggling with your skin let's start with moisturizer now with red or Ros acia prone skin you can find that the skin is also tight or uncomfortable um maybe feels really dry so moisturizer is a really important thing that will help to keep your skin more comfortable now crucially a lot of those symptoms can come from a compromised or irritated skin barrier so when your Skin Barrier is really healthy if I could do this a little analogy for you this Skin Barrier is going to lock moisture in it's going to prevent anything from getting into the skin like irritants pollution dirt and everything's going to sit really nicely but a compromised Skin Barrier looks like this and so all of those irritants can get in moisture can get out and you can notice an increase in things like the redness and sensitivity so ideally your moisturizer that you're going to use twice a day is going to have ingredients in there that help to strengthen the Skin Barrier which in turn is going to make your skin feel more comfortable less tight less dry you're going to see less redness it's going to have a huge knock on effect when it comes to your moisturizer ingredients like ceramides are brilliant for helping to manage rosacea um a nice rich formula can often be quite helpful because a lot of that dryness will respond well to that however everyone's skin is different if you find that you have maybe a more oily skin you can get lovely gel consistencies that will be just as good as at repairing the Skin Barrier ultimately I would say as well try and look for something that's as simple as possible if you want to add active ingredients to your routine you could add those in elsewhere separately if it was me I would look for your moisturizer to really just focus on the Skin Barrier and moisturizing the skin all of that said I'm a huge believer in everyone's skin is different and the number one thing I would say is just carry on with whatever is working for you now the next one is SPF that I would say is crucial to wear every single day here here the thing with SPF everything you read or any dermatologist will tell you it is the most important thing to use every day we all know this however if I could just put it to you another way the other thing that's crucial to remember with SPF is that wearing it every day will reduce the appearance of your redness the sun is one of the biggest triggers of rosacea and it will literally cause your skin to flush and look more red in lots and lots of people so when you wear your SPF not not only are you protecting your skin from the raise of the sun pollutants irritants you know it's every single Derm as well will tell you if you're hoping to achieve a healthy aging and look as great as you can at any age it's the number one thing that you should be using but in terms of redness it's a very crucial step in helping to keep your skin really calm so if that if you're not using it every day let that be a little motivation that it is really worthwhile to use and then your cleanser now with cleansers I personally think this is a really important step to get right when you have redness or rosacea it's really important as the name would suggest to clean your skin that's great however lots of cleansers are rich and moisturizing and have ingredients in them that again are going to further support that Skin Barrier if you are in the very early days of managing your rosacea I would honestly recommend using a cream cleanser something really gentle massage it off with your hands when I come to do a cleanser video I'll go into more detail I'm not one of these do as I say not as I do I deviate from that sometimes I will use soft cloths I will sometimes use a balm um I've mixed and matched over the years and I've found what works for me but in the early days if you're thinking of making tweaks to your routine to keep things really comfortable cream cleanser no cloth you can get cream cleansers that will take all of your eye makeup off and everything um you will see a world of difference to how hydrated your skin feels and also when your skin is really nicely cleansed all of those other things are going to work well alongside it and then finally your treatment step this is where you're maybe going to have ingredients that aren't necessarily available over the counter that are really going to Target repairing and helping to reduce the appearance of that redness what I would say to you in this instance is seek medical attention luckily there are loads of online resources now that you can use I will make another video on these but on the top of my head I want to tell you about the boots online doctor where you send photos in of your skin and then they can make a prescription for you that they think is most appropriate and you just pay for that prescription there's skin and me which is an online pharmacy prescribed service where you can have a formula made for your with active ingredients that you wouldn't be able to buy over the counter that they can formulate with that will help to Target the redness or clearer that's what I'm currently using at the moment that is a dermatologist design service of the same nature where you fill out a huge questionnaire they will make a bespoke formula to treat your skin and you use it in harmony with all of those other steps but you will see a huge difference because it's been made to really Target what is going on on your skin now there are other things you might want want to add in your active ingredients vitamin C for example for radiance we'll go into all of that in a further video but for now those Basics your moisturizer SPF cleanser and a treatment step are the first things I'd really prioritized to keeping your skin as calm as possible I've got nothing on my skin today by the way if you want to have a little look um mine is kind of playing ball really well at the moment got a few little uh broken veins there that I might think about having some laser for really considered did that before but I am starting to think about it now so if I do that I can absolutely keep you posted there's a Top Line I want to keep these videos really easy to dip in and out of so I'm going to leave it there I'll go into more detail about all of those categories with product recommendations in another video if you've got any questions please feel free to leave them here and I'll talk to you soon take care",

After\u00a0\nwatching that video, an old friend approached me,\u00a0\u00a0 asking me to help her build a\u00a0\nskincare routine for her rosacea skin\u00a0\u00a0 and kindly agreed to let me\u00a0\nuse her pictures in a video. And as many of you seemed to enjoy the \u201creal\u00a0\nlife before and afters\u201d, and because I just\u00a0\u00a0 did a video on skincare tips for rosacea skin\u00a0\nand many of the problems you might encounter\u00a0\u00a0 if you suffer from it, I figured it would be\u00a0\na great time to share how far we have come. If you are new here, welcome! I am Doctor Anne,\u00a0\u00a0 a physician passionate about\u00a0\nskincare and well aging. For background information, my friend is 36 years\u00a0\nold, is a teacher and has two small children - so\u00a0\u00a0 no time really, not really invested in skincare\u00a0\nand was diagnosed with rosacea a few years ago.\u00a0 Back when she was first diagnosed, she\u00a0\nwas put on Soolantra, which worked,\u00a0\u00a0 but made her skin pretty dry and tight,\u00a0\nwhich is why she stopped it eventually.\u00a0\u00a0 Over time there were breakouts again, then some\u00a0\nredness and a general irritation with tightness.\u00a0\u00a0 She purchased some stuff from the drugstore, but\u00a0\nthat didn\u2019t help much, and that is where we start. First impressions This is her skin, as you can see there is general\u00a0\nredness on the cheeks and breakouts, mainly around\u00a0\u00a0 the chin. If you look closer at these breakouts,\u00a0\nyou will see that there are no blackheads,\u00a0\u00a0 only papules and whiteheads, which is the main\u00a0\nway to distinguish rosacea breakouts from acne.\u00a0 She described her skin as dry,\u00a0\nirritated and very sensitive. The first thing we did was take\u00a0\na look at her current routine:\u00a0 In the mornings she used a little water to freshen\u00a0\nup, then some Rose Water Face Mist from Garnier\u00a0\u00a0 and the Avene Antirougeurs Day with SPF 30.\u00a0\nAt night it was eye makeup remover, the same\u00a0\u00a0 Garnier Rose Water Face mist and then the Avene\u00a0\nAntirougeurs Calm Masque if she could be bothered. Now I have two main issues with this:\u00a0 For someone with dry and tight skin, I think\u00a0\nthere should be a proper face cream and some extra\u00a0\u00a0 hydration. Nothing against Avene, but if you have\u00a0\ndry patches, you need something more occlusive,\u00a0\u00a0 especially at night. A face masque a few times\u00a0\na week will not give you the desired results.\u00a0 And then that Rose Water Face Mist. Here\u00a0\nis a picture of the ingredients: Yes,\u00a0\u00a0 there is Glycerin as humectant, but I think that\u00a0\nthe alcohol denat used as solvent along with\u00a0\u00a0 the added Fragrance and Linalool aren\u2019t really\u00a0\nhelpful for skin that is chronically inflamed. The skincare routine we started with Referring back to my skincare tips\u00a0\nvideo, these were my main tips:\u00a0 A minimal and gentle routine\nGentle cleansing once a day to\u00a0\u00a0 get rid of pollutants, makeup and sunscreen\nNo potential irritants, so no essential oil,\u00a0\u00a0 fragrant components or alcohol\nBarrier repairing ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 like ceramides, Niacinamide, Colloidal Oatmeal\u00a0\nand occlusives to stop Transepidermal Waterloss\u00a0 Azelaic Acid\nSunprotection To keep things simple, we did take a look\u00a0\nat some easily available things from DM,\u00a0\u00a0 a German drugstore that has a very affordable\u00a0\nskincare line called Balea Sensitive. No\u00a0\u00a0 potential irritants in the products we\u00a0\nchose and easy to pick up while shopping\u00a0\u00a0 for toothpaste and diapers. Two things weren\u2019t\u00a0\navailable there and had to be ordered online. The first suggestion for her\u00a0\nmorning routine was this:\u00a0 Cleanse with water if needed, apply a layer\u00a0\nof Geek and Gorgeous Liquid Hydration Toner,\u00a0\u00a0 followed up with a Niacinamide Serum from\u00a0\nBalea (it contains 10% Niacinamide and 1% Zinc,\u00a0\u00a0 which I hoped would help with the inflammation)\u00a0\nand then a rich hydrating sunscreen, the Garnier\u00a0\u00a0 Super UV Anti-Age SPG 50 + with Glycerin.\nThe toner wouldn\u2019t have been necessary,\u00a0\u00a0 but she liked her face mist and I figured\u00a0\nit would be a great replacement, as it has\u00a0\u00a0 no essential oils, fragrance or alcohol,\u00a0\nbut Panthenol to help reduce inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0 I picked the Garnier SPF despite it\u00a0\ncontaining older chemical filters because\u00a0\u00a0 I never found a mineral sunscreen I liked, but\u00a0\nit was a mistake, as you will see in a bit. For her evening routine it was the following:\nTo gently remove makeup and dirt, we started\u00a0\u00a0 with the Balea Cleansing Oil, followed by a\u00a0\nlayer if The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension\u00a0\u00a0 10% and then the Baleas Ultra Sensitive\u00a0\nNight Cream, which is basically a plain\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer with enough occlusives to prevent\u00a0\nwater loss, but really no irritation at all. So a simple routine with Niacinamide and Panthenol\u00a0\nto help with inflammation and the skin barrier,\u00a0\u00a0 Azelaic Acid to keep the rosacea calm, a\u00a0\ngentle cleanse and a plain rich moisturizer. Check in after six weeks Now I would love to tell you that ever since\u00a0\nher skin was at its best, happy and calm,\u00a0\u00a0 but that would be a lie. When we did our\u00a0\nnext check-in after around six weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 that was how her skin looked: less redness, yes,\u00a0\nbut around the chin area even worse than before.\u00a0\u00a0 The SPF hadn\u2019t worked for her at all, had even\u00a0\ngiven her eczema around the eyes, which is why she\u00a0\u00a0 was back on her Avene Antirougeurs Day SPF 30. Now\u00a0\nI would have been happier with an SPF 50, but if\u00a0\u00a0 you apply the Avene one liberally, you are still\u00a0\ndoing great in terms of protecting your skin.\u00a0 When I asked her how her skin felt\u00a0\nthough, she was actually pretty happy:\u00a0\u00a0 No more tightness, no stinging, no dry\u00a0\npatches, so at least something had worked. The adjustments we made The next step we took, and if you take away\u00a0\none tip from this video, let it be this one:\u00a0\u00a0 The next thing we did is book a\u00a0\nconsultation with a dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0 You see, the breakouts and irritation around her\u00a0\nchin were most likely caused by the need to wear a\u00a0\u00a0 face mask all day - I told you she is a teacher\u00a0\n- and if you have rosacea and it gets worse,\u00a0\u00a0 there is no point in experimenting.\u00a0\nActive rosacea flare ups need to be\u00a0\u00a0 treated with prescription medication\u00a0\nbefore they lead to permanent changes! Her dermatologist put her back on Soolantra, which\u00a0\nnow that her skin had the supporting skincare\u00a0\u00a0 wasn\u2019t an issue anymore and another few weeks\u00a0\nlater, this is the current result. Much better\u00a0\u00a0 and most importantly with her skin still feeling\u00a0\nsoft and calm rather than tight and irritated. Take home messages Now while this doesn\u2019t really sound like\u00a0\na skincare success story, I think this\u00a0\u00a0 routine building process teaches us two very\u00a0\nimportant things about skincare for rosacea skin:\u00a0 First - skincare alone isn\u2019t enough\u00a0\nto fix a serious skin issue and\u00a0\u00a0 you need to see a dermatologist if\u00a0\nthings don\u2019t improve very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0 No matter if it is acne, rosacea or eczema.\u00a0 And second - while skincare isn't\u00a0\nthe hero here solving the problems,\u00a0\u00a0 it is an important supporting act. The\u00a0\nskincare we picked helped her skin feel good,\u00a0\u00a0 which in turn made it easy to keep using the\u00a0\nprescription, and that is not to be dismissed.

        "transcript": "[Music] welcome back we have another derm reacts video and today we're joined by dr sam ellis hi she's a board-certified dermatologist in northern california and today we're looking at a really interesting routine i always say they're interesting i'm always like fascinating this is like a day in your life and i'm like this is so interesting my job is interesting okay yeah exactly today we're looking at dana and she has something that was diagnosed by her dermatologist as acne rosacea so acne rosacea interesting because i didn't know that there was like a difference really i know i know nothing about rosacea really when it comes down to it that's okay you're not alone but i know that a lot of people deal with rosacea looking at her pictures what would you say i mean she's been diagnosed already at this point right yeah so rosacea tends to have that more central facial involvement so cheeks nose forehead and chin and then sort of have this background redness and a lot of people think rosacea is only redness but you can have lots of bumps which we call papules as well as pustules so pus-filled bumps with rosacea the thing with acne and rosacea is they can both manifest with similar findings and so sometimes especially in younger patients they'll either have both conditions going on which kind of muddies the picture or the rosacea will have an acne pattern and then in both cases we would call it acne rosacea so would you treat that differently than typical acne yeah i typically treat it more as rosacea just for me and my own practice just because rosacea prone people tend to have more sensitive skin so we have to be really careful with what kind of actives we're having them incorporate and then if they're not responding optimally to the rosacea treatment alone then adding in some specific acne fighting ingredients is a nice way to go you know we've talked about rosacea on this channel with other dermatologists and stuff and a lot of the time i hear that you don't get diagnosed with rosacea until you're older at least 30s and stuff do you think it's one of those things that maybe this might be like we're finding more and more that it's maybe happening in people that are younger i'm not sure i mean we do think of rosacea as being a skin condition that's mostly of people age 30 and up but i definitely see patients in their 20s and even some in their teens who absolutely have rosacea so it just because it's most common in people over the age of 30 doesn't mean that people under the age of 30 can't have it all right so before we get into her video if you love skincare make sure you like this video and subscribe to the channel and also if you want to send in your skincare routine feel free to look in the description box where we have more information hi my name is dana i want to take you guys through my skincare routine and i'll start with the morning so typically in the morning i cleanse my face with cfl just the gentle skin cleanser i'll go in with the rosacea medicated rosacea gel all right so she starts off cleansing her skin in the morning do you think for somebody that has rosacea acne rosacea i guess i always picture sensitive skin so that i think sensitive skin shouldn't cleanse their skin in the morning but i'm making things up right so i don't actually know i don't deal with rosacea myself so i think i mean i think that generally if you do have sensitive skin if you tend to be dry if you have rosacea that morning cleanse really tends to be unnecessary so i think just a little bit of water in the morning to set your skin up is generally all that's needed even when you're using as gentle of a cleanser as cetaphil this next product that she uses rosacea i've actually never even heard of this what what are your thoughts of it yeah so this is an over-the-counter rosacea targeted medication it's sulfur-based which is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial so it can help with rosacea it's not like gonna knock rosacea out but for people who are sensitive that are redness prone it can be a helpful product to have in the in the lineup then i'll follow up with the moisturizing cream from stridovie so then she goes in with the cerave moisturizing cream very straightforward i have no no qualms with that yeah i love that one bear republic mineral sunscreen lotion 30 spf i have been to a dermatologist where they diagnosed me with me rosacea um so very red in the skin have the little bumps whole nine yards tons of fun as far as that sunscreen goes i i used this such a long time ago i personally felt like it was a little bit thick that's why i remember it not being as cosmetically elegant as i wanted but i mean the ingredients are fine it's got good you know broad spectrum coverage yeah that's what matters the most i mean you know i feel like sunscreen is actually really important to bring up because she's a redhead it's always important to wear sunscreen but specifically with redheads and also for someone who's dealing with rosacea absolutely rosacea you know one of the most common triggers for rosacea flares is uv radiation and sunlight so the fact that you're protecting and we see her protecting is huge it's essential yeah is this a time and and i don't want to discourage her because she's obviously using sunscreen which is the most important step but is this a time maybe that we would say that an spf that's higher than 30 might be more important maybe so the differences between spf and 30 and spf 50 are pretty negligible if you're putting enough of the product on it blocks 97 versus 98 of uv radiation when you use the right amount but most people don't put that full thick coat of sunscreen on so it's worth considering using an spf 50 planning for maybe some under application so before we discuss her morning routine i i think we should look at the night time to see what she's doing get the full picture yeah as for my night routine i do sort of a foaming facial cleanser and after that i follow up with dabzone gel that my dermatologist prescribed nighttime routine she actually switches cleansers and she moves on to the cerave foaming facial cleanser i think it's totally fine when you have oily skin i think it's a little bit more of a drying cleanser versus like the cetaphil which is just really basic right absolutely and i think that foaming i think gives people that satisfaction of a cleanse and that's why they reach for foaming cleansers i totally get that i do that too but if you are prone to dryness or irritation sometimes some of these foaming cleansers can be a little harsh okay so now we're saying that she does have a prescription product right dap zone what do you think about that i like dapsone it's typically a treatment i think of for acne it's anti-inflammatory it's antimicrobial it's not as commonly prescribed mostly because it's very hard to get it covered by insurance oh yeah but it can be a really nice anti-inflammatory especially for people who are not responding to maybe more traditional or commonly prescribed acne topicals you're talking about like the retinoids in like retinoids benzoyl peroxide clindamycin that type of thing lastly i use this exuvance overnight transformation complex it has hydraulic acid um botanicals pha does a really good job of calming my skin down it seems like all right this exuberance overnight transformation complex i've never used it i'm a big fan of phase yeah they're great i think a lot of people associate them with this like very mild exfoliation but what i personally like them for is the hydration yeah they draw water in i mean they're great for hydration yeah i really really like that but this is really interesting to see in someone's routine that has acne rosacea so i'd love to hear your thoughts on it yeah and i think for her too she's probably using it more in a hydrating capacity especially the fact that she says that her skin feels good after using it and not stripped or irritated which can happen with using more harsh exfoliants that she's really using it for its moisturizing benefits and it seems to be working well for her if i'm really breaking out in rosacea i'll go in with this sodium sulfate self face to my sulfur cleanse that my dermatologist prescribed um but that's pretty much it i haven't really found any relief from my acne rosacea it seems like no matter what i use things just get worse so looking for something guys thanks guys i feel so sad when i hear that it's like i've been trying all these different things she's obviously seeing a germ right and she feels like nothing's working that cleanser that she threw in there is a sulfur cleanser so that means that she's probably using that instead of her cerave foaming cleanser when she's having a pretty bad breakout she said that's what i would expect yeah that sulfur sodium sulfacetamide is a prescription cleanser that we give to people with rosacea but what i thought was kind of interesting is she said that she only uses it when her rosacea gets bad and i i caution people to like cherry pick when they're using their products it's so important that even when your skin feels good that you're still using your prescription medications especially you know talk about it with your dermatologist but i encourage people not to back off of use just because their skin feels good because that's right when that flare is getting ready to gear up again you know i see so many people say that they stop using a product because it stopped working for them what were those commercials back in the day and maybe i'm really aging myself i think it was like a deodorant commercial it was like you use this product you don't even have body odor and they're like exactly you know because they're using their deodorant yes that's always people like you don't need botox you don't have wrinkles and i'm like that's why yeah exactly and it's kind of the same concept it's like you keep using these products even when your skin looks good unless your doctor told you not to yes so really it comes down to she seems to be doing what she's supposed to be doing or seemingly supposed to do right what do you do in this case obviously she should go back to her dermatologist and say this is not working for me what do we do now right but if she were sitting in your chair what would you be saying to somebody like this and before you answer that a reminder this is not medical advice obviously you know this is not a patient relationship here this is you just kind of giving a little bit of a perspective yeah and just my general approach to people who are struggling with rosacea that they feel is not optimally controlled so the first thing i do is i have a conversation with the patient and remind them that rosacea is a lifelong condition it's something that is going to be there running in the background no matter how good your skin looks or feels and so we really have to get at with the patient what their goal is is their goal to never have a breakout again is it just to control redness and once you understand your their goals you can kind of decide how aggressive you want to be with prescription medications because i think here she has a great over-the-counter routine and there just might be some little topical additives that are prescription that could give her that little boost to make her more confident and happy with her skin so let's take a look at her morning routine cleanser cetaphil totally fine great she's using that prosatia do you think that maybe she needs something else not that's over the counter i would say yeah okay so you're kind of getting at the like if it's not working maybe we need to up this yeah maybe we can up the ante a little bit yeah you know what do you say to people when they want to only use over-the-counter products or when they're looking for more of that straightforward approach i know i'm guilty of this i don't sometimes want to start a prescription like i was prescribed orals yeah and partially because you know i'll get like the hormonal breakout and then occasionally with like melasma and stuff like that like there's just like reasons to get on it yeah to have just beautiful skin right but i didn't do it because i was like i don't want to commit to this right it's a big commitment and what i often will say to patients is you know your skin condition your acne your rosacea it's not going to kill you but it's really about how much does it bug you what do you want to do how many steps do you want to take to get it to a place that you're happy with and when we're looking at certain things that are available over the counter we might be limited in how much improvement we can get with that and just if you understand that and you're okay with that we can talk about it but know that i have a few other things in my back pocket if you kind of want to bring those into your routine too when would be the time to maybe start using the or you know use the over-the-counter products and ingredients i think if your condition is mild you're not getting any residual scarring from it it's not something that you're thinking about every day if you're thinking about your skin condition every day you're looking in the mirror and you're sad you know because of your skin and it's not responding to your over-the-counters that's the time to seek out a dermatologist but mild acne mild rosacea they absolutely can be managed with over-the-counter products too so that said with the morning routine you probably wouldn't change anything besides maybe adding something prescription if she went to go see her dermatologist yeah as far as the nighttime routine it sounds to me like you prefer she just stop using that serum foaming cleanser and just always use her sulfur cleanser yeah right this is why doctor this is why her doctor gave it material right yeah it's probably meant for nightly or consistent use you have to remember that a lot of times products require consistent use over time to see the best results and sporadic integration interior routine is not going to always give you the consistent results you want with your skin think about that dap zone is that a prescription if she's not seeing enough like change in her skin is this a time when maybe a dermatologist might go ahead and say let's switch to something else totally and i think usually we give people around 8 to 12 weeks maybe up to 6 months depending on which topical it is to kind of give it its proper chance to work effectively and then if it's not really doing what it we want it to at that point in time you gotta you gotta change it up yeah are there you know like oral medications and stuff that a dermatologist might explore as well yes definitely i think oral antibiotics are probably a mainstay treatment for rosacea but you have to be on them long term generally to keep that control and that's a big commitment to be on antibiotics long term so it's always a conversation i have with my patients and to see again how much is their disease bothering them what kind of symptoms are they having what do we need to do to really get that fully under control okay wait so i hear all of the dermatologists come in here and say that they put people on antibiotics right yeah and you know the first thing that comes to mind for me yeast infection yes for women this is a problem yeah dude so is there kind of like a multiple situation here happening with the prescription yeah i mean it's definitely something we talk about and there are certain people who are going to be more prone to yeast infections than others i mean we typically will use lower dose antibiotics more for their anti-inflammatory effects than their antimicrobial effect and that can sort of mitigate those yeast infection side effects we put them on probiotics we have them drink yogurt or yogurt-based beverages to kind of help with that but there are certainly patients who just can't be on antibiotics long term because they're too prone to yeast infections this is good i've always wanted to know this the things we really need to know but it's true i mean like that would be a huge hindrance to someone being compliant on their medication and some people can't tolerate it because it causes too much stomach upset or other things so that's always something that needs to be discussed and explored that's good to know yeah and even just hearing that you usually prescribe antibiotics at a lower level like i'm thinking about like after my c-section the antibiotics and stuff like that it was like strong yeah we're trying to stop infection down there right yeah and i think people are you know acne and rosacea they are not infections but there it's more of the skin's reaction to bacteria or mites or other things on the skin and so really you're just trying to get that anti-inflammatory effect more so than the antibacterial effect of the antibiotic let's talk about mites because we are talking about rosacea in this video specifically i i think a lot of people don't like hearing this but i think we need to discuss it slightly yeah so there is a very small mite so an eight-legged creature that lives on all of our skin called demodex and it's on everyone first of all but it gives you the heebie-jeebies to think about it they are microscopic you absolutely cannot see them but if i take like a little scraping from someone's skin in clinic and i look under my microscope you can see them and for people with rosacea we think that they probably have an excess population of these demodex mites but also probably just more of an inflammatory reaction to them so sometimes you don't have more but the way your skin responds to them is more inflammatory it's fascinating to me when you start to really think about like this symbiotic relationship yeah different they probably have some type of byproduct that comes off but yeah that is irritation but i'd have to look into it oh but again we all have it i mean i'll just wipe it off i know man gotta live with it it's like dust mites and stuff oh right yeah you think about it and you're like oh they're living on all of our stuff yeah they're everywhere yeah but it is it's definitely something there's some correlation with people with rosacea absolutely 100 all right so i guess with all that said it's really it's another one where we're going to time to go back to the dermatologist i hate saying that i always feel like oh i brought one of the best physiologists in we're gonna help you out but this is one of those situations where it sounds like you do need a prescription yeah and you're i mean it's actually a compliment that you're doing all the right things with your topical regimen that you can do on your own and it's not wrong to have to bring in a professional to kind of optimize your skin thanks so much for watching this video again if you want to submit your own skincare routine look in our description box where we have the information you can also find dr sam ellis here on social media you wanna tell me where yes i

        "transcript": "a great anti-aging skincare routine does not have to be complicated so I'm going to show you how to build one for both morning and night if you're new here welcome otherwise welcome back I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel this video contains a partnership with first aid Beauty and in a little I'm going to talk more about their new retinol product that I think is an amazing addition to a nighttime skincare routine especially if you have sensitive skin so I really wanted to build both a morning and a nighttime skincare routine for you here I have never done that in a YouTube video before but I feel like we're at the beginning of the year a lot of people have made resolutions to take better care of their skin but sometimes taking that first step of putting the routine together can be the most intimidating so I really wanted to break it down for you especially if you're new to skin care or new to incorporating anti-aging skincare into your your routine I'm going to start off with my nighttime skincare routine and then I'm going to meet you back here in the morning and do the morning skincare routine for you I feel like calling this an anti-aging skincare routine can be a bit triggering for people I'm not saying that we shouldn't age truly aging is a privilege but what I run into in my practice is that people come in feeling like their outside doesn't match how good they feel on the inside and that disconnect when you are younger is maybe not so obvious but I've seen it in my patients as they get into their 40s 50s 60s and Beyond it starts to become really frustrating so I don't think we have to have this hyperfocus on looking youthful but I do see the toll it takes when your skin doesn't reflect how good you feel and so when I'm talking about putting together an anti-aging routine it's really to maintain the health of your skin so you can be confident in what you're walking around the world in so every nighttime skincare routine is going to start with a cleanse we need to prep the canvas there is a lot of stuff that accumulates on our face during the day some we purposely put there like skin care and makeup some is just the sweat and grime and pollution from the day and regardless all of that needs to come off so that whatever we are putting on to leave on overnight can work its best effects and isn't fighting with anything else that's been left on our skin from the day and I'm going to be doing a double cleanse tonight I do this almost every night so if you are newer to skincare or building a routine a double cleanse involves either like an oil or a jelly cleansing step to remove the vast majority of the residue and then it's usually followed with a water-based cleanse to just get the rest off and some people might say that's not a simple routine why wouldn't you just give me one cleanser but I find a big mistake that people make is that they think their one cleanser is removing all the residue from their skin so one way you can test this is you can wash your face with your favorite cleanser and then take like a very clean white towel afterward and wipe your face and if you have no residue on the towel for example if you were wearing makeup that day then that one cleanse is probably doing the trick but I can tell you anytime I try to get away with a single cleanse if I have makeup or water resistant sunscreen on it's not happening the first cleansing step that I'm going to use tonight is the Crave beauty makeup rewind transforming jelly cleanser this was like one of my absolute favorite products that I used in 2023 and I've brought it with me into the new year so you can see it's kind of like a gel and then I'm going to warm it up in my hands and then I'm going to apply it to my face and let it sink in and massage it in to kind of start breaking down my makeup I'm going to take some more onto my eyes as well and just slowly and gently work that in if you care about anti-aging be delicate with your skin now skin is fairly resilient I mean touching your skin is not going to be a problem but sometimes I see people like really working it in around their eyes and like if you want your your eyes to look good now and 10 years from now be [Music] gentle now that that is all massaged in I'm going to rinse it off and then go in with my second cleanse I feel like that first cleanse did a really good job at removing the majority of my makeup but I still see some little traces so I'm going to go in with my second cleanse now I'm using the cavey hydrating facial cleanser when you are putting together an anti-aging skincare routine or a new skin skare routine you don't always have to have everything in your routine be new so if you've been using a drugstore cleanser for a long time and you like it bring it on into the new routine this is a really nice gentle cleanser so I'm just going to give a little water in that I recommend it all the time to my patients who have more sensitive skin still really effective but non-stripping nice and nourishing just going to work that into the skin doesn't sting around the eyes and and then once I've sort of done that we're going to rinse it off okay so now the canvas is fully prepped we are ready to go in with the Heavy Hitters for anti-aging and if someone were to ask me like what is the number one anti-aging skincare ingredient that you need in your nighttime skincare routine and I don't care where I am if I'm at a cocktail party talking skincare if I'm in clinic talking skincare 10 out of 10 times I'm going to say a topical retinoid retinoids are molecules derived from vitamin A and when applied topically they signal the skin to do so many wonderful healthy anti-aging things like improve skin cell turnover so that your skin may look less dull improve pigmentation in your skin help build collagen within your skin which is going to help with fine lines and wrinkles so really they do so much when it comes to anti-aging for being just one thing now that may sound too good to be true and sometimes it is because on the flip side of being very helpful for anti-aging skin things retinoids can also be quite irritating they can cause flaking peeling dryness redness stinging I mean I cannot think of a more problematic skin care ingredient in that respect I have so many people who come into my office as dermatologist who are saying hey Dr Ellis like I want to incorporate aoid but I just can't because I can't get my skin to tolerate it and that's where the product I'm using tonight really comes in so this is a newer launch from first aidid Beauty and it is their 0.3% % retinol complex serum and I love this for a lot of reasons this is a retinol product that is actually years in the making and what makes it so special is that it's really designed for sensitive skin the goal with this is to be able to use it regularly and consistently enough without irritation that you actually get to see the benefits of using a topical renoid over time also just a shout out for the texture of this I'll put it on my face in a second but I have to show you so it is a serum but it is a very lushy plushy serum like do you see how juicy that is like I actually cannot wait to put that on my face and I also think that is part of generating like a good skincare routine it has to be something that you actually look forward to doing and I I genuinely am looking forward to putting this on my face I also really like that this is a pump dispenser because the pump is a perfect serving size for your face so you do not need a big amount of retinoid to get a lot of improvement I find a huge error that people make is they over apply their retinoid and that's going to lead to more irritation granted you could probably slather your face in this and it won't cause irritation because of how it's formulated but just in case we'll just use exactly what we need and I do my tiny dot method which helps you spread it very evenly over the entire surface of the face without wasting it and without needing to use too much I'm going to grab another pump for my neck and my chest so the 0.3% retinol complex in here has retinol but it also has a vitamin a derivative that you might be less familiar with called retinol propionate and the advantage of using retinol propionate in a formula is that you can get the same effects of retinol as shown in some clinical studies but with less irritation so why wouldn't you want equivalent results with fewer side effects of course as a dermatologist I am always giving skincare recommendations and I would say one of the things I get asked about the most is a ret Noid that is not going to be problematic for sensitive skin or retinoid that someone could potentially use with their rosacea or their eczema or a retinoid that they can use as a beginner step in an anti-aging skincare routine and this one from first aid Beauty it is so good I mean not only is it gentle and effective but also experientially like just how my skin feels right after putting it on and what it's done for my skin over time like I feel very good about it now I'm a dermatologist I also use prescription strength retinoids but I can't always always especially if my skin is really irritated or acting up also I have a partner who is very stubborn and does not like to use retinoids and he has been asking for this I mean to have my husband ask for any skincare product is the highest compliment so if you have someone in your life who needs to start on a retinoid maybe try this one the fourth and final step of this nighttime skincare routine is going to be applying a moisturizer and the moisturizer I'm using tonight is one of my absolute favorite moisturizers of all time this is probably one of the very first skinc care products that was ever holy gril for me it's the first aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream this texture like you know your skin is going to be so moisturized after that and I love it because it has oatmeal so it is very soothing I'm a big oatmeal gal it can help with irritation it can help with a disrupted Skin Barrier so I'm just a huge fan of this moisturizer all around I recommend it to so so many people you can use it on your face and your body which I also like a multi-purpose type of product and if you are really prone to dry skin flaky skin even without like a renoid in your routine if that's just something that you deal with because you might have mature skin or eczema or you're just dry this is an excellent excellent moisturizer I went in with layer number two and I actually bring a lot of my moisturizers over my lips as as well I usually go in with some type of Vaseline at night right before bed but I actually like to bring my moisturizer onto my lips that is it for my nighttime skincare routine I will meet you back here in the morning to show you exactly what I put on my skin during the day to protect it and help it Thrive all day long see you soon good morning it is nice to see you again it is quite early but I like to get my skincare routine in before my son wakes up because once he's up you know it's unle leashed we don't know if I'm going to have time to Circle back to do a routine so finding time in your day to be consistent with your routine whether it's an anti-aging routine whether it's an acne routine is so so important consistency above all else is what's going to help you find success and my skin feels great from last night it is hydrated it is not irritated it's not bright red and you know for someone like me who has sensitive skin who has rosacea there are a lot of products that can really set my skin off so for me to wake up with just very happy skin is such a win and with that let's get into our morning skincare routine this is going to be simple straightforward efficacious this is actually just a two product routine you could expand it from there but I am really kind of taking this down to the Bare Essentials and this is actually quite representative of what I do on a typical workday I don't have a ton of time in the morning to get ready or I don't want to get up earlier to do a more protracted skincare routine so these are the things I stick with just like in a nighttime skincare routine the first thing we're going to do in a morning skincare routine is prepare our skin for any leave on products that we are going to be applying you can do that by washing your face with a cleanser and often times you can use the same cleanser that you used in the evening or you can just do a water cleanse Splash a little bit of water on your face to prep the skin this is what I do most days I feel like for a very long time people were sort of indoctrinated with the idea that you had to wash your face with a cleanser twice a day but for people who have dry skin super sensitive skin washing twice a day with a cleanser can actually be too much and it can be overly stripping to the skin even if you're using a gentle cleanser so if you've been struggling with dry or sensitive skin I totally encourage you to just give water cleansing in the morning a try so what that looks like for me is I'm just grabbing a little bit of water in my hands and we're just going to kind of Splash it on the face rub it around make sure I'm getting out any little eye boogers that uh formed overnight and after that I'm just going to take a clean towel and Pat my face dry we don't want to be scrubbing or rubbing especially if we're introducing a renoid product our skin is going to tend to be more sensitive and so you don't want to be doing added exfoliation with a rough towel so I'm just patting dry leaving it the tiniest bit damp for the next step and we're going to move on now if someone told me I could only use one product in the morning for an anti-aging skincare routine or really any type of skincare routine it would absolutely be sunscreen when it comes to anti-aging when it comes to skin Health in general sunscreen and sun protection is really doing the heavy lifting but if I got to pick a second thing to use in my routine it would absolutely be a topical antioxidant and specifically vitamin C in the evening a skincare routine is really focused on correction correction of whatever bothers you whether that's fine lines and wrinkles dehydrated skin pigmentation irregularities damaged Skin Barrier nighttime is for correction daytime skincare is really focused on protection as we go through our day our skin gets assaulted by environmental exposures whether that's UV radiation from sunlight or pollution and so we are doing a morning skincare routine to protect against damage of course you can have corrective steps during your morning skincare routine but I think if we are prioritizing and simplifying a routine focusing on protection against skin damage is the way to go obviously sunscreen is great for that but so is Vitamin C the vitamin C I'm using today is by my brand prequel it's called lucency so there are many benefits to topical vitamin C one being a protection Factor so it protects you against free radical damage so as your skin is assaulted during the day these little oxygen-free radicals form in the skin and they can bump around on important structures in your skin and prematurely break them down so vitamin C guards against that scrubbed a little bit here I'm going to rub it between my palms and then just press it into the skin and like any anti-aging skincare we are going to be bringing this down on the neck pardon me onto the chest chest um and onto the back of the hands as well I always find it so satisfying to get that First skinc Care step on my skin in the morning it's like okay the day is happening but aside from the protective abilities of vitamin C it also has these other benefits like brightening the skin helping with hyperpigmentation also helping support collagen synthesis so anything that's going to help us make new collagen make new structural support proteins in the skin is going to help anti-ag us and again anti-aging means something different for everyone I know that word doesn't sit right with some people but really what I'm thinking about is having healthier skin skin that you feel more confident in skin that is stronger and more robust and that's really the ultimate goal after the vitamin C has dried down on the skin which really just takes a few seconds I'm going to be moving onto my second and final step of my morning skincare routine which is sunscreen now a lot of people will want to put on other serums in the morning or maybe even apply a Moisturizer in the morning and you can always use the same moisturizer that you used in the evening if you feel like it's light enough but in my case I find that a lot of sunscreens I use tend to be moisturizing enough a lot of sunscreens are formulated in more moisturizing bases so unless you're really struggling with super dry skin or lots of sensitivity you actually don't necessarily need a moisturizing step in the morning and the sunscreen I'm going to be going in with today is a Korean sunscreen by a brand called Paro it is the daily soft touch sunscreen it is SPF 50 so nice high levels of sun protection of both UVA and UVB rays so as a reminder UVA radiation longer wavelength penetrates deeper in the skin more so contributes to premature skin aging wrinkles things like that and then UVB radiation shorter wavelength hits the top of the skin more likely to cause things like skin cancer I'm almost done with this tube so I hope I can get enough out this is one of my favorite sunscreens ever just goes in so effortlessly to the skin kind of like a yogurty texture when I think of anti-aging skincare like when I'm talking to patients in the office and counseling them when they're like Dr Ellis can you just make me a routine like what do I need what are the essentials I talk about the anti-aging Holy Trinity which is a retinoid which we used in our nighttime skincare routine vitamin C which we just put on and sunscreen if you have those three things you are so so set if you do them consistently so sunscreen is just kind of the final piece of that puzzle you'll also see that I'm bringing the sunscreen very up close under my eyes and onto my eyelids not everyone can tolerate that if you have really sensitive eyes and you can't put sunscreen around your eyes just wear big sunnies when you're outside if you're getting a little bit of sun or you know sun exposure while you're inside I'm not too worried about it it's really that sun damage that happens when you're outside in harsh sunlight that is going to cause the greatest problems when it comes to skin health and uh causing damage to your skin all right so I mean look at the finish on that like so stunning and that's the other thing if you starting a skincare routine you're more new to Skin Care finding products that you love not just what they do for your skin but the texture the application even the packaging is so important I feel like you need to be motivated to use your skincare it's a habit and you need to be inspired and so finding the sunscreen that you love the vitamin C that you like the retinoid that works for you and that you enjoy using those are all such important factors when it comes to being consistent over time and seeing results and with that final skincare step we are done here thank you so much for joining me for both my nighttime skincare routine and my morning skincare routine I hope you picked up a tip or two if you learned anything or you have any additional advice for sensitive skin definitely put it in the comments below

        "transcript": "hello i'm dr vinita ratan i'm a doctor but i'm also a cosmetic formulator specifically for skin of color so today's video is about rosacea we're going to be talking about what it is what causes it what makes it worse how to treat it and the mistakes that people make right at the end i'm also going to go through product recommendations as you know none of my videos have ever been sponsored and they will never be sponsored this means we're basically creating a evidence-based video library for you so you know what to purchase and what to avoid if that sounds good to you give me a thumbs up let's dive right in so let's start off with what is it it is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it tends to take place actually more in europeans so basically northern and western europeans it only takes place in about four percent of the population that are asian or african so it's not that common um to actually have rosacea when you have skin of color however if you do have it and you have skin of color you have to be careful because with us our melanocytes are larger and they are easier to trigger already so as i always say one scratch one bite or one burn and we hyperpigment but when you have rosacea your skin is already more sensitive and if you use products on your skin that burn the skin or irritate the skin it's not just a temporary irritation it leads to hyperpigmentation which is why when you have rosacea in skin of color it's it can be far worse it can be affect your life more because the consequences of you trying to treat the rosacea you have to be far more careful with skin of color than you are with caucasian skin so there are a number of known potential triggers for this it could be down to your immunity it could be down to vascular disorders another one tends to be uv radiation which is why it tends to be worse in the sun and infectious agents too now the clinical cause of the disease can vary from person to person it tends to start off when you're younger with just redness of the skin so temporary flushing or temporary erythema erythema is just another word for redness and this gradually persists and it takes longer longer for the redness to go and on top of that you start to get telegectasia which is when you can see broken capillaries under the skin this all tends to indicate that this is a vascular condition and studies have also shown that there's increased blood flow in those erythema areas in the red areas i'm sure there are other triggers that you've probably noticed including stress menopause can make it worse alcohol spicy food and sometimes even exercise so anything that basically makes you go red when you have rosacea is just another phenomenon where the skin becomes more sensitive to for those of you who have an immune dysregulation this can happen in response to uv radiation microorganisms injury from physical or chemical injuries such as burns the environment such as wind hot weather or steam and also cosmetics that you put on the skin that are not naive safe so things that can irritate the skin can make it worse so for example if you have rosacea and you try using retinol which is an alcohol which can be irritating it can flare up the rosacea so you have to be a lot more careful with which creams you purchase and actually this whole channel i only ever recommend safe products that means no denatured alcohol no fragrance no essential oils these things can sensitize the skin and dry the skin which is exact opposite of what you want when you have rosacea so all the triggers i've just discussed can basically increase the cytokines in your skin and these are signaling mechanisms that tell the skin to wear now in an inflammatory mode to produce inflammatory mediators and this then leads to more blood flow in that area which makes your rosacea worse now when we talk about microorganisms and rosacea there are two main micro organisms that we're talking about demodex follicularum and h pylori let's start off with demodex follicularum this is a parasite that lives in the sebaceous gland and can lead to inflammation of the hair follicle clinical studies have basically shown that there's an increased amount of parasites in people with rosacea skin compared to healthy skin h pylori on the other hand is a little bit more controversial because studies tend to contradict each other h pylori is found in the blood serum of rosacea patients which means that there's an increased amount of antibodies to h pylori in those with rosacea these are small potential triggers the big one however is uv radiation uv radiation equals more erythema due to vasodilation so basically increased cytokines in the skin equals increased angiogenesis which means new blood capillary formation and of course more information moving on to reactive oxygen species now we all produce this it happens when uv hits the skin uh free radicals form but it also happens in your mitochondria in your body now this leads to an oxidative stress and this basically can reduce your natural defenses but also it increases cytokine production so i the mediator for inflammation this is one of the key reasons you really want to be ingesting antioxidants and using antioxidants on the skin so foods that are full of antioxidants are colorful foods so it's easy to remember beetroot broccoli oranges and then of course on the skin itself using antioxidants such as vitamin c i wouldn't use vitamin a retinol for rosacea i'd rather use either retinol palmitate which you can basically find in the in our dranita rattan power antioxidant serum which is your fat soluble vitamin c retinol palmitates a non-irritating form of vitamin a and your vitamin e and coenzyme q10 so you basically want to use antioxidants like that that are non-irritating but will mop up free radicals foods that we tend to say to avoid would be things like spicy food drinks such as caffeine and alcohol some people even say to stay away from dairy so things like cheese and chocolate we also tend to say to avoid smoking because of nicotine which is a vasodilator too so because this is a chronic condition it really is about managing the condition you want to avoid triggers as much as possible because every time you trigger the skin it takes longer for the erythema to go so you end up in a cycle where you know you trigger the skins taking ages trigger the skin again and it takes ages so actually understanding your skin and how to take care of your skin really is key to managing rosacea so what do we do step by step the first thing you want to do is block uv from hitting the skin this is the number one cause so you want to be using i would recommend a mineral spf 50. the reason is zinc oxide in your mineral sunscreen is anti-inflammatory so for example in um our zinc bowl which you can find from our website skincare by doctor v down below it's got 17 zinc oxide in it which is anti-inflammatory so you i would rather you wore a physical sunscreen over chemical sunscreen with rosacea i'd also recommend a wide brimmed hat to avoid any direct sunlight on the skin if your rosacea is mainly here in the zygoma areas of the cheekbone area then you can get yourself a pair of these so this basically i use this for my melasma on my cheekbones and it prevents a uv from hitting my skin and these are dr v sunglasses so they're massive but they're great for driving because when you're driving um sun tends to be quite low and it it hits the face and the skin is red you know one hour later i would manage your diet and stress levels because any form of stress makes chronic skin care conditions worse it ages the skin if you have eczema it worsens your eczema if you have acne it worsens your acne any condition you have worsens with stress so this is considering this a chronic condition i would be doing everything i can to manage my stress levels i also recommend you opt for mild skincare just because you know on tic toc there's the thirty percent aha bht um the red vial that everyone's using that would not be suitable for rosacea it will burn the skin and it will lead to hyperpigmentation for skin of color so you just need to think of your skin as very sensitive and needs to be taken care of gently even the actives that you choose should be mild they should have the same ph as your skin i would avoid acids as much as possible so i've written out a routine for you on what i would recommend so this routine is actually tried and tested because my husband has rosacea you know it affects him so i basically made this routine for him which has been doing for years and has controlled his rosacea so first thing in the morning i would wash your face with a micellar gel wash you can use the one from simple however because of sensitive skin the one that i basically the ingredients i put into our micellar gel wash contains niacinamide uh which is strength as a skin barrier plus i put incentella asiatica and panthenol which are both anti-inflammatory plus i'm putting glycerin which is a water magnet so you're holding water from that top layer of skin because with rosacea you basically want to create a healing environment for the skin and you don't want to over strip the skin when you're washing it that's the first mistake that gets made so this is our micellar gel wash which you can purchase from the link below too second you really should use a fatty moisturizer that has some key ingredients you want ceramides in there because ceramides are lipids they're fats that basically retain water in that top low skin and give you that healing environment and you want a long-term moisturizer you don't want a lotion where water is evaporating from the skin and the skin feels tight you want something that's going to feel hydrated all day so ingredients to look for in your moisturizer would be things like ceramides peptides anti-inflammatories you want niacinamide too which strengthens your skin barrier and humectant so those are the key ingredients you really want in a nice knife safe moisturizer for rosacea so the couple that i love i do love cerave because of the ceramides in it i love cetera ben it's a very simple knife safe moisturizer it doesn't contain all the bells and whistles that i discussed but it's a fatty moisturizer and then the one that i made was the serrapep brightening moisturizer and in here i basically applied put in the niacinamide your ceramized peptides and anti-inflammatories now with after this you really need to apply spf 50 considering uv is the um can really make rosacea worse and especially if you're in a hot country spf 50 is non-negotiable so after your nave safe moisturizer apply your anti-inflammatory sunscreen so ideally look for mineral sunscreens things that say 100 mineral sunscreen some of them are hybrid some of them you know have mineral plus chemical chemical i'm not a huge fan of for a number of reasons number one it's not great for sensitive skin number two i like to put sunscreen around the eye area because this is where you tend to wrinkle first and actually zinc oxide is much better for around the eye area it's a lot more gentle on the skin and is good for sensitive eyes too now things that you must avoid are exfoliation exfoliation is not your friend we're trying to strengthen the barrier the barrier is weak and damaged so please never exfoliate avoid retinol i'd rather go for retinal palmitate or retinaldehyde these are less irritating versions of vitamin a avoid ascorbic acid instead for tetrahexal dicoloscorbate that's a fat soluble vitamin c which actually strengthens um the collagen so it actually penetrates down into the dermis avoid lactic acid too which is just another acid that exfoliates menthol as well so things that tingle the skin basically for your time routine uh wash your face with your micellar gel wash again you want to remove the sunscreen or any makeup from the day then apply your antioxidant serum that has the same ph as your skin so it's non-irritating so for example the one that i you know give to my husband is our antioxidant power serum followed by your knee safe moisturizer so you want to create that healing environment on the skin if your skin is particularly dry you may also want to use a barrier oil on top something like marula oil from the ordinary is excellent drug elephant does a very good one too and that would just continue to retain water on the skin so minimize trans epidermal

        "transcript": "you're in your 30s and you're deciding what are you going to do with your skin maybe this is your first introduction into skincare or maybe you've had a routine throughout your 20s and now you're trying to figure out how to transition into your 30s so this is our skincare routine for your 30s video right and sorry to disappoint you but 30s can be rough you're not going to leave like your entire youth behind but it's going to start to show and we're going to help equip you for the changes that are occurring or about I feel like I'm starting a puberty video but like we're going to equip you for the changes that are going on in your skin during your 30s all things 30s skincare here we go here we go Dr Maxfield and I are both in hour now later 30s mid 30s mid on the way up to late and we have noticed some of these changes in fact if you look back at our older videos when we are early 30s you actually kind of see time and stress hitting us in a very accelerated way so we empathize with all of you um some of the changes that you may be going through or experiencing with your skin let's talk about some of the changes that pretty consistently happen to people's skin when they turn 30 and go from the 30s into the 40s now there's this sort of concept that your birthday turns to 30 and then suddenly like your collagen production slows down and you know your skin cells turn over slower it's not like the next day it's not like there's a clock that goes off and it's it's just just a gradual progression that this happens at but you start to notice these changes usually in your 30s right it's true and I think the science like the first time I heard this was an undergraduate but basically our skin cells sto becoming new like our cells and our whole body sto becoming new and growing new cells and they just kind of hang on for dear life and slowly wear down that occurs like maybe in our mid 20s but it all starts showing up in our 30s so what this looks like just from an aging perspective is that the dark spots the texture the fine lines all of that starts to become present and starts to become permanent and prominent in addition we also start to develop rosacea this is something else that peaks in about the 30s and then continues to start now the one good news if there is any is that for some of us acne is going to disappear like your traditional acne starts to fade away or probably has faded away by the time you're 30 on the flip side you may be one of those unlucky people who now have just suddenly started to experience what we call hormonal acne which all acne is hormonal but this is the traditional what everyone refers to is hormonal acne and I actually have a lot of patients that come into the office and they say I never had acne throughout my entire life as soon as I turned 30s I started to break out along my jawline this is also very common in this age group so we're going to try to figure out how to address all these different types of concerns but you may need to start altering your skincare routine and start actually targeting some of these issues all right so what are some things that you started to experience with your skin at 30 and Beyond this is very interesting you ask that so definitely fine lines and wrinkles like it got to a point we do videos we look at ourselves all the time and I started realizing I was like my goodness my forehead it's just like line upon line upon line upon line and that just wasn't the case before like good or bad it just wasn't the case before and then same thing with dark spots I noticed I was getting a lot of dark spots you know what actually we didn't talk about this well we did but it pores like there was a time where Dr was like dude your pores and your nose is like out of control and so like changed my routine change some things about that well I didn't say all that I no you said all no I said you were developing Rosia and we needed to reach you before you developed ropa is what I said be specific apples and oranges like that's what I got from it basically but that's a part of rosacea right so we did mention rosacea that's one of the four types ocular uh acneform vascular and then Fus and the oil Grand rosacea so I I've experienced again dark spots lines and rosacea most prominently I would say texture for me like just growths in general like milia skin tags large oil called sebaceous hyperplasia I also started to experienc fine lines and wrinkles other things in general white hair um yeah that's true harder to lose weight that's unrelated to skincare hair loss right so these are all things that I I didn't have in my 20s and now have acquired in my 30s we could talk a little bit about even like what we do in our routines um to Target some of these issues when these things start to show up it's a little bit of like negative feedback it's like a slap on the wrist when you do something bad and so candidly my son protection has gotten a lot better over the last 6 Years cuz I'm still in my mid-30s I'm very I'm religious with it I like don't miss it ever when I'm outside I'll be going to surf and I will turn around and go get my sunscreen before I go back out to Surf it's that important to me and it's made a huge difference for oil I do a lot of ingredients for oil control um Incorporated everything for that white hairs of just like Let It Go what are you going to do at this point for white hairs I don't do anything for that yet I am allergic to hair dye so so um so there's not much I can do anymore there's like semi-permanent hair dyes and stuff but and there's like this whole discussion of like can you reverse Grays probably not um but like there is some new data coming out that certain like things can help but we're not like quite there with like a complete solution to that so just in general some of these things are like untargetable right but I've adopted a hair loss routine and I've adopted essentially like a quote unquote anti-aging or healthy aging routine um in order to combat a lot of the issues I'm just experiencing with time and so like Dr Maxfield said sunscreen has become so critical to my routine getting Botox once a year um is a big thing for me most people that get BOTOX get it every 3 months but for me I get it once a year because I want to avoid the lines but I also don't want to have like no movement cuz I like to express my face and I'm the same way it's like botox once a year it's not super deliberate it just happens like I just fall into a Botox needle you know how that happens the other thing too yeah life is like the diet exercise thing I've improved my my diet I've slipping back but I exercise habitually and have for like 17 years now like I just never miss exercise I'm also have gotten a personal trainer recently due to my lack of own willpower um trying to work through that um maybe I'll share some of that stuff with you all on Instagram if you're following along let's talk about specifically targeting some of these issues that you may start developing again this is where you definitely need to start introducing sunscreen in your routine this is going to be for everybody sort of UN Al across the board your skin is just less giving at this time right I developed sort of this mask of redness um rosacea more of like the platic type of rosacea that occurs in the mid face I develop that and anytime that I don't wear sunscreen that flares you'll notice more redness on my cheeks your skin just cannot rebound as easily as it once did your skin cells are slowly turning over and so retinol is an ingredient that can speed up that skin cell turnover you're may be developing dark spots and so again retinol is something that can block tyrosinase block the transfer of pigment and also remove pigment that's deposited in the skin if you're developing milia because of occlusives or just your skin cells aren't turning over as quickly retinol is something that can help to prevent Mila and texture on the skin and so the first thing that I started to introduce in my 30s was actually retinol and that's like a perfect segue into like all the ingredients and what you should be doing for the treatment of your skin at this time in your life and I think that's the right move one is sunscreen I'm I'm telling you we're going to Benchmark this moment and then 30 years from now let all go back and watch this video from our spaceships because like sunscreen is going to pay dividends like this is the equity you're putting in now for you to pull from that equity in your 50s and 60s it's a huge difference the second thing being retinoids you can introduce one ingredient sure Treo one this is a staple ingredient that covers all the things aging dark spots texture collagen last and and it's something that you can use your entire life it's better the longer you use it so start now because we're huge fans of deliberate skincare it's a little challenging for us to build a routine for each of you because your issues in your 30 can vary vastly from one person to the next uh but we'll try to Target the common concerns and give you either one ingredient or one product that could Target that concern uh for your treat step of the routine so to start off gentle cleanser is always going to be consistent across the board so we always do cleanse treat protect so at night let's start cuz I always start with the night routine cleanser uh just a gentle cleanser this is again if you're wearing makeup if you're wearing water resistant sunscreens your skin is less forgiving in your 30s um just telling you this from personal experience it's just less forgiving like when I forget to remove my sunscreen at night in the morning I feel like my pores are clogged I can see it I can actually see buildup of sebaceous filaments in my nose when I don't remove my sunscreen so again like your skin isn't as resilient so this is where you're going to definitely want to maybe potentially start introducing even double cleansing in your routine that's using a cleansing oil or a cleansing bomb we both like the pharmacy cleansing bomb um I like the DHC cleansing oil you like the Dermatology cleansing oil um also though I will say like just a oilbased cleanser here is like a really nice way to do it Sashi states of skin is one I've been obsessed with lately I don't personally love oilbased cleansers but this one for whatever reason I'm like obsessed with minimal lather oilbased remove your sunscreen and makeup now here's actually where a cleanser can become important like functionally important and this is the introduction of sulfur a hero ingredient that gets no love not because it smells that that can't be it can't be it at all it just doesn't get the love it deserves for me the prescription sulfur ingredient the sulfur sulfacetamide combination is by far the most effective the most aesthetic the least smelly and honestly it's less expensive than any over-the-counter counterpart so I hate to propose like a prescription option but that by far is my favorite conversely you have like a Kate Somerville sulfur cleanser which is kind of Classic this ingredient can be wonderful for especially Ros the acne form of rosace in particular which is again hitting this age group so again you could be even targeted with your cleansing part of the routine you can introduce cleansers that have mild exfoliants in them like polyhydroxy acid or mandelic acid or glycolic acid again sodium sulfacetamide you can also introduce like a Benzel peroxide for an acne but regardless you can be very targeted with this step and sulfur if you're developing rosacea is a really really excellent ingredient in some cases it's over promising under delivering people are swearing that it can like eliminate pores there's no evidence that sulfur eliminates pores by any means great for rosacea incredible incredible ingredient for rosacea next I would say for treating at night again very deliberate if you have acne differ in gel or trano and a retinoid in general different is the over-the-counter one just go with that if you have rosacea overthe counter you're kind of limited AIC acid would be my go to option you can get the one from Niche Beauty Labs that's a 15% AIC acid overthe coun I don't even know if it's legal if you're not able to get the theid AIC acid there's the ordinary at 10% there's Paul's choice at 10% theorum has a 10% but they have a 15% which is like prescription level I don't even know how they're doing it and then let's see what other conditions dark spots yeah dark spots but just before we go to dark spots since we're focusing on hormonal acne for this age group I have to shout out a prescription option again I feel like I'm like in the doctor's office talking to you now but win Levy this is a topical anti-androgen so it's going to like blunt the hor hormonal response to your hormonal acne and the reason I think it's important is just it's Unique there's nothing else that's doing what it does right now and so that can be a very effective ingredient especially for that hormonal component especially again along the jawline male and female guys and girls you can all use this ingredient now to dark spots we talked about troan retinoids being the anchor but here's where you can introduce your like skin malist Consolidated product may love fadeaway serum the Dr Shaw dark spot Dynamic delicious ser serum of love what is the name of this product it's called remedy for dark spots it's called it's the easiest name of all I actually deliberately chose the easiest name for the product you can remember the may love fadeaway serum but you can't remember remedy for dark spots it's just so functional I thought that couldn't possibly be it I'm a functional person that one includes your retinoid it also includes 11 which is absurd 11 supporting ingredients like it's a one-step shop for your dark spots but again ingredients you're looking for if you want to break it down by ingredient you want your transic acid you want your Alpha abutin you want your gluconolactone you want your coic acid niinomi I mean it's an extensive exhausting list that's why I like consolidated products for this right exactly one product here targeting some of the dark spots in discoloration that you either got from your acne uh your post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or a lot of my friends developed melasma in their 30s combined products are really effective faded is another option that we've been big fans of um some people don't like the sulfur smell of the product because it smells like rotten eggs but some people don't mind the smell at all and then another thing that I personally experienced in my 30s like I said is texture the first thing that I did when I developed texture was I introduced a retinoid into my skin care routine and I I blitzed it every night got irritated you can watch some of our old videos on how that process looked I look like such a a little kid back then I got really irritated but I eventually powered through it cuz you will get retinoid dermatitis or irritation when you initially start your retinoid and if you're in your 30s and you're starting it For the First Time start every other night until your skin gets used to it my texture on my skin got about 80% better from just the retinoid alone and then I wanted to really kind of break through to get that shine it was very I was very focused on getting the glow this dewy skin that I was seeking in life and I introduced a chemical exfoliant twice a week right so I would do retinoid three nights exfoliant retinoid three nights exfoliant 31 31313 and that broke me to that like 90% cuz otherwise it just wasn't breaking through with retinoid alone and so I introduced a lactic acid exfoliant into my routine and if you're looking to to treat texture retinoid five six nights a week five or six nights a week an exfoliant for your skin type once or twice a week and we'll link below how to pick an exfoliant for your skin type a link above how to pick an exfoliant for your skin type um because you should be deliberate about which type of exfoliant you're going to choose right and honestly that in my opinion is sufficient for texture at this time of your life we will talk more about this later as we like move back in time or forward in time with life routines cuz that's coming by the way this is just like the beginning of a life Journey um but that probably is sufficient right now for your skin and the last part of this treat thing is and this is always like a little bit of a taboo topic but again being very deliberate about why you're doing things when I started turning kind of mid-30s I started to really develop bags under my eyes dark circles I was traveling a lot or am still traveling a lot always just kind of like looking tired and noticing noticing my age and fatigue mostly in my eyes so this is when I started to introduce more of an eye cream into my skincare routine I don't think eye creams are Miracles by any means but I do think they can help with some of the puffiness and dark circles they can brighten the under eye area so I've always been a big fan of the L'Oreal Paris caffeine and hyaluronic acid eye serum there's also other options biossance is still my number one favorite eye cream Marine Al I just think it's incredible I don't know why and then at night it's just simply again a moisturizer a moisturizer based on your skin type dry skin thick cream oily skin gel normal skin you can go either way yeah exactly just moisturize or not but do it to your preference for your skin type very subjective goal here like it's very subjective if you want to great if you don't want to great if your skin likes this great if it doesn't like this great it's all up to you and then your night is closed then you go to bed this is again whatever amount of sleep you get congratulations You' fallen asleep and woken up now it's the daytime and our morning routine so morning routine you know a lot of people say you don't need to cleanse twice I cleanse twice a day um I just use a gentle cleanser that doesn't Strip My Skin Barrier otherwise I look really oily in the morning if I don't um and I have all these actives on my my skin over so I personally like to cleanse the second time in the morning so I use the same gentle cleanser that I was personally using at night I also cleanse in the morning mostly because I work out in the morning and I want to wash before I go to work so I do that again don't stress it just whatever wash you want is fine here so treat here is again based off of your specific skin goals I won't belabor the points because we've kind of talked about a lot of these ingredients already for dark spots here you can use a vitamin C you can use supporting antioxidants to complement the vitamin C and then your sunscreen Additionally you can find a leave on sulfur product I think it's Neutrogena has a nice leave on sulfur product one of the very few so for rosacea that's a good option to compliment what you're doing there and then that basically takes you to perhaps the foundational part which is protection and of course this is sunscreen everyone should be using sunscreen this is the years it's going to matter the most you're actually going to notice a difference a noticeable difference in the quality of your skin when you don't wear sunscreen even in within one day I personally I don't know if you notice it but if I don't wear sunscreen for a day I notice more redness I notice more just inflammation I I notice even more like texture to my skin it's like it's a weird thing but I do notice the difference and maybe because I live parttime in Miami now so I get a lot of sun exposure otherwise and it's very noticeable on my skin so sunscreen very very critical find one that you love you may want to look into more sophisticated sunscreens at this age you know you're leaving your 20s you're entering your 30s maybe you want something that is going to double as almost a foundation dupe in a way as Dr mfi puts it I still believe right you're in your 30s I'm in my 30s I still believe that the Alta MD UV restore tinted it just makes my skin look better like I put it on and I'm like yeah that's it it's cuz you're wearing makeup it's like sunscreen but it really does actually function for that no makeup makeup look because it's kind of forgiving like if you've ever worn tinted sunscreen like it graciously Blends it kind of blurs what you want it to blur it has that dual purpose of protecting and it's subtle so I I do think tinted sunscreen is great for that but whatever sunscreen you prefer again for your skin type you're going to have to try them you're going to have to see which ones you like chemical or mineral totally your preference but you really need to invest the time into building this cuz this is like the next 30 40 Years of your life are going to hinge on that one step and if you make the change now in your 30s it'll be noticeable in your 40s or 50s your 60s or 70s or 80s I think it will make a big difference now if you look at our analytics on YouTube the biggest Peak is actually 30 to 40 so U many of you are sort of Aging with us um and so we'll share some of the things that we do maybe we'll even talk about some of the procedures we either have done or are considering doing ourselves um so that you can kind of make those decisions with us whether you want to do those things or not and you can actually see the results of those procedures but anyway that wraps it up you have everything from cleanse treat protect for all of the nuanced changes for your skin in your 30s and don't fear aging Don't Fear the wrinkle don't fear a white hair it's all part of the normal part of aging and this is where you're going to start to actually notice it and how how much you want to do to prevent that and how much you want to just do nothing to prevent that is going to be up to you as an individual you'll see a lot of your friends start to get fillers and Botox and Laser procedures and even plastic surgery at this age and you'll wonder like should I do these things too and like you really need to decide like what you want to do for yourself we can't tell you we could tell you that him and I we kind of like a more natural look um we try to describe to our patients like a more natural healthier way of Aging but like I still have patients that come in that want a little bit more extreme outcomes ultimately you have to decide like what type of outcome you want and this is the sort of formative years where you're going to be choosing how far how extreme how unext reme you want to go but as long as you're wearing sunscreen you're still going to be so much better off than most people and just skincare alone will get you far ahead of the game I don't know that's such a good summation I don't want to step on it perfect like be deliberate be you enjoy this journey of life we're just here to equip you with the tools and information so you can make deliberate decisions that is all so we'll see you all in the next video please like comment and subscribe and we appreciate and love all of you on this aging journey together see you next time",

        "transcript": "I'm a dermatologist let's talk about ways to improve your morning skincare routine so Jade rollers and Gua Sha will not replace Botox but it is nice in the morning to move fluid away from your eyes to the lateral part of your face to drain the lymphatics I prefer products with caffeine like the inky list or this is L'Oreal keep this in the fridge so when you take it out it's nice and cool then use the cold applicator to move the fluid away while using the caffeine to help with puffiness then you want an extra glow after that use Vaseline to Slug it all in such a cute little sample then film on the cheekbone to seal in all that hydration from the eye serum boom and instead of using a retinoid which I rather do at night you want to protect yourself from UV rays and pollution with vitamin C just use a few drops of this to brighten your skin before sunscreen hope this helps peace",

        "transcript": "hey everyone and welcome back to my channel i'm here to finally show you my day-to-day skincare routine as most of you know already i have struggled with rosacea dry sensitive skin enlarged pores and acne after a lot of research trying to figure out the causing solution i have found these products to help calm my sensitive skin and have noticed a big difference after sticking to this routine over the past two years [Music] so first cleansing i used to use the bioderma sensitive face wash but i noticed my skin was a lot more hydrated after using this cerave cleanser plus it's more affordable i just use one pump [Music] i know the way i'm washing my face seems a bit rough but i'm actually gently washing for around 20 seconds before rinsing my skin feels extremely plump and moisturized after this wash and i highly recommend this cleanser to anyone with sensitive skin i pat my face dry with a face towel that i change every day [Music] next i use hyaluronic acid by the ordinary which is a humectant it helps the skin to hold onto water keeping your skin moisturized i spray my face with mineral water which i keep in a spray bottle before gently applying the serum just be careful with what products you use before and after this serum it works better when you don't mix products together before applying and i always make sure to gently tap the product in until my skin has fully absorbed it niacinamide and zinc this is another perfect serum for those with rosacea acne and enlarged pores i always notice my skin texture is a lot smoother after using this i did perch for around a month when first using this but the deep inflammatory redness i had disappeared and all the small bumps i got around my forehead and cheeks went away i just used one large drop to cover my entire face and neck it's always advised to use spf to protect your skin from aging and getting damaged by uv rays i used this tinted cream by bareminerals which gives a glowy radiant look and you can just spread it with your fingers [Music] as i tend to leave the house a lot and i don't want to be self-conscious of my rosacea but i also don't want to use heavy makeup because it clogs pores and it's too much effort i use this cream which is good for people with sensitive skin it's gluten fragrance paraben free and more [Music] i use the cerave moisturizer when my skin is feeling super dry or i treat it as a spot cream for sun cream i use this la roche posay invisible fluid i have tried other sun creams which either tingles my skin or is too white and oily or my skin becomes flaky when applying makeup so far this has been the only sun cream that hasn't given me any issues but i'm open to any other recommendations this organic rosehip oil is a perfect replacement for a moisturizer it doesn't clog pores or make your face oily it has a perfect balance and hydrates my skin when it's feeling dry sometimes after showering i'll use this instead of all the other products and then apply makeup i only perched for a week when first using this and it really helps to calm down my redness as you can see my face is glowing my cheeks are shiny and smooth this is my simple affordable am routine [Music] when removing my makeup i use the bioderma scentsy bird remover i used to use simple wipes after realizing wipes are too abrasive for my skin type and doesn't fully remove makeup [Music] when only applying spf i just use one cotton pad and gently wipe my face and neck i always see beauty salons and makeup artists use this to remove makeup and now i know why it's perfect for every skin type and you see results it also doesn't leave your skin feeling tight or dry [Music] i use the cerave face wash again and i don't use any type of physical exfoliator or brush as it's not good for rosacea skin types time is simple and again it depends on how my skin is behaving but tonight i'm just using niacinamide as a first step before going on to my next step [Music] it's important to keep using this serum if you have large pores i then use azelaic acid which is perfect for cleaning out pores and encourages cell turnover [Music] every time i get a large spot on my face i will apply this over it for two to three days before applying any type of spot sticker and it really helps diminish the spot without scarring i just apply a pea-sized amount to the areas where i break out the [Music] most there's a lot more that you should do for your skin in terms of what you eat what you drink and how fit you are it's important to be clean on the inside before you focus on the outside i drink honey tea every morning to regulate bowel movement and honey contains antibacterial properties so it's good for acne prone skin you already know that i eat super clean according to my intolerances and this really helped get rid of my redness and acne recently i have been supplementing as my body is deficient in nutrients i have been taking this calcium magnesium and zinc supplement magnesium can reduce stress and boost exercise performance zinc has wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties next i take probiotics i have been taking this prior to the chinese medicine that i'm currently doing and recently this really helps my gut and having a clean healthy gut means having healthier skin finally i've been taking this skin nails and hair supplement it's only been a few weeks and i have noticed improvements with my nails now i'm waiting to see if it does anything for my skin it does contain collagen which improves skin elasticity and increases blood flow to the skin [Music] [Music] you",

        "transcript": "let me guys get excited because this video is a long time coming I feel like it's been over a year since I did a tips for rosacea today's video I'm going to share with you guys dermatologist tips for navigating skincare choosing skincare and thanks to avoid and skincare products for people with rosacea one of my favorite skincare products for people with rosacea you guys know is Rosa care and I'm partnering with procure the maker of Rosa care on today's video so I'll talk a little bit more later in today's video on why this is a fantastic product for people with rosacea in their skincare routine if you have rosacea you already know what a challenge it can be to navigate the skincare aisle and select skincare products that do not irritate you staying burn cause excessive redness and irritation on your skin rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by hypersensitivity to things that come in contact with the skin and that hypersensitivity manifests with symptoms such as burning tingling flushes of redness heat and little red bumps that almost look like acne and pimples but are a little different in their underlying nature rosacea is an incredibly uncomfortable disease to live with so my number one tip for rosacea skin care and navigating rosacea skin care products is keep it simple keep it simple in that your routine and the products you use should not be excessive there should not be more than three products think about it rosacea is a skin disease in which things that come in contact with the skin are very likely to irritate you so reduce the number of things that you put on your skin that is my number one tip basic tenets of a skincare routine really for anybody but in particular for people with rosacea should just be three products a gentle cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen and I'll get into the details and nuances of those in a moment so that leads me into my next tip and that is cleansing your skin it is important to cleanse your skin and to select a gentle cleanser a non soap cleanser I have several videos talking about some of my favorite gentle cleansers for the face so I'll list those videos down below for you to check out things that come in contact with the skin from your environment so on the skin and can contribute to you prolonged symptoms and exacerbation of redness and irritation the way you cleanse your skin out is very important you need to do so in a gentle manner just use lukewarm water want to avoid extremes of temperature and just use your finger pads in a circular motion across the face cleansing your skin this way is important for everybody but in particular for people with rosacea because physical physical touch physical factors can also flare redness irritation and precipitate flares of your disease in other words things like spin brushes scrub brushes facial brush those harsh washcloths can be your nemesis so just use your finger pads in a gentle circular motion and then rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water my third tip is to use a moisturizer on a daily basis whether your skin is dry or oily you still really need to moisturize moisturizers hydrate the skin by trapping water onto the surface of the skin and sealing it there in place they also condition the skin cells smooth the skin cells and calm down inflammation for people with rosacea using a moisturizer is really important also because we know that in individuals who use a moisturizer along with their rosacea medications they have a better outcome to their treatment than if they don't use a moisturizer and the reason using a moisturizer is so important is that it helps just you the skin hydrate the skin reduce the likelihood of irritation and the way to apply it is to use it immediately after cleansing to damp skin so once you rinse off your cleanser in the face is still wet that is when you want to apply your moisturizer and the reason for this is that it capitalizes on the hydration status of your skin at the time of cleansing just as you wet the skin to remove that cleanser there's a lot of water on your skin so moisturizer with its ingredients will come on and we'll lock that water in place and really helped you drive hydration into your skin and see the skin and reduce irritations and doing so will reduce the severity of rosacea and we have several studies showing can improve your treatment outcomes with your prescription topical and oral medicaid rosacea medications it's a really important part of rosacea skin care now my fourth tip will come as no surprise to you all because I talked about it and any chance I get I will bring it up and that is to protect your skin from the Sun wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen rosacea patients have a challenge however in finding a sunscreen that will protect their skin without simultaneously irritating the rosacea so some tips for selecting a sunscreen are to select a physical sunscreen and what that means is that when you look at the active ingredients of the sunscreen it should say zinc oxide only or it should say zinc and titanium dioxide those should be the active ingredients these active ingredients are most well tolerated or people with rosacea they are not irritating they do not sting they do not burn on the other hand other ingredients in sunscreens that are chemical ingredients chemical filters things like oxybenzone Ava Ben's own chakra line these ingredients can really be irritating for people with rosacea these ingredients can cause a little bit of irritation to this these types and precipitate a flare so it's best to select a mineral only physical sunscreen and by that again I mean one whose active ingredient is either zinc only or the active ingredients zinc plus titanium dioxide those are most well tolerated and the sunscreen also should be labeled broad-spectrum and it should be an SPF a sun protective factor of 30 or higher in order to properly protect your skin sunscreen needs to be applied on a daily basis even when it's cloudy out this is because the ultraviolet radiation that comes from the Sun can come through the clouds it can come through your windows and can contribute to the inflammation in your skin and drive your rosacea so you need to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen on a daily basis some other tips the over choosing your sunscreen is make sure it does it's fragrance free fragrance as I'll get into later is a it can really be problematic for people with rosacea to make sure it's fragrance free look for ingredients like silicones silicones go by the name dimethicone and a few other names all lists down below for you guys to help navigate but silicones are well tolerated in moisturizers and sunscreens for people with rosacea there they tend to be lightweight they are oil-free and therefore are comfortable for people with rosacea hyaluronic acid is a humectant that will frequently be included not only in moisturizers but also in sunscreens and is also well tolerated in people with rosacea helps to hydrate the skin and in a sunscreen can really helped you combat some of the dryness that you might experience with using a mineral sunscreen they can be a little drying so those are some good ingredients to look for and some good features to look for in choosing a sunscreen check out my videos on my protection mineral sunscreens I reviewed several and again I'll list the video that I'm talking about it down below in the description box to make it easy for you guys so my this set of tips pertains to ingredients what to look for what to exclude the number one thing that you should excluding from your skincare products is fragrance I always encourage everybody to make every effort to exclude fragrance from their products to only select fragrance free products but in particular people with rosacea have to do this and the reason is twofold people with rosacea have a higher likelihood of developing something called allergic contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis happens when you become sensitized against an ingredient and then you develop a skin allergy every time you come in contact with it so they have a higher likelihood of developing an allergy to fragrance in their products and people with rosacea are also more likely to have flares of their symptoms regardless of allergy when they come in contact with fragrance why is that so well the reason is because fragrance compounds can function not only as irritants on the skin and drive inflammation but they're also things called vasodilators vasodilators make the blood vessels in her skin to dilate and bring more redness into the skin which is the opposite of what you want to do in rosacea so selecting products that are fragrance free is really important selecting a product oh it's fragrance free it's tricky to navigate because you might be duped into thinking that a product labelled unscented is safe unscented is not fragrance free when you read unscented be very careful because unscented often means the product contains fragrance and it contains a masking fragrance to hide the scent of the product so that you don't detect it with your nose but it's still there and fragrance goes by a lot of names so I will list these names down below in the description box for you guys so you know what to look for because manufacturers are not really required to disclose the inclusion of fragrance in their products I'll list those names down below for you guys so you know what or in addition to fragrance the other ingredient that you want to avoid it's kind of very similar to pregnancy is any type of essential oils lavender oil rose oil rubs hip oil any type of essential oil regardless of how it was processed and made can contain things like fragrance ingredients that while you may not detect them with your nose while they may not have an aroma to them they can still irritate and bother the skin of rosacea so avoiding products with essential oils is really important the other ingredient to avoid is the inclusion of alcohols in your skin hair products alcohols are frequently present in a lot of sunscreen will often have alcohol so you've got to look for that ingredient alcohol is also added to stabilize active ingredients in sunscreens so it's in a lot of sunscreens and for people in general you know alcohol and alcohol Danitra they're not it's not a bad ingredient it's not something to fear but for people with rosacea it definitely is something that can contribute to a flare of their disease and irritate their skin simply because it is more on the drying side and people with rosacea just don't tolerate that to the same degree as other skin types and other people with without rosacea so avoid avoid alcohol and then menthol menthol is something that has to be avoided you'll find men fell on a lot of face washes and it imparts a tingling sensation you don't want a tingles and rosacea and some other ingredients in that vein that are often out it includes things like peppermint as well which is added to make things tingle and then witch hazel I have videos talking about witch hazel and you know it can be irritating and it really can be irritating for people with rosacea the other ingredient to avoid is eucalyptus eucalyptus is frequently added as a preservative to products and but it has been reported as something that is really aggravating to people with rosacea there are some beneficial botanic ingredient so in rosacea and for rosacea care one of which includes niacinamide niacinamide is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for redness it can it can reduce the amount of redness and it also can help your skin barrier in healing and keep your skin hydrated so it is a good ingredient ceramides are also a good ingredient to consider or rosacea they are natural part of our natural lipid barrier and in moisturizers can help our skin barrier and then also licorice root extract is very helpful in rosacea skin care products because it like niacinamide can be calming out anti redness you will find licorice root in a variety of products that are labeled anti redness and kind of targeting people with rosacea so that is a good ingredient from a cosmetic perspective another ingredient to look for property in a product you look for is chromium or color correction with a green tint this helps to camouflage redness and even out skin tone very nicely the reason I like this product is they is specifically formulated for people with rosacea and they they have not included any of the common rosacea irritants there's no menthol there's no eucalyptus there's no fragrance so all the stuff I told you to avoid is not in this this contains good ingredients for rosacea including niacinamide which as I said is anti-inflammatory helpful for the skin barrier it also includes licorice root which is anti redness and thirdly it contains the color correcting chromium property so it can nicely helped you even out skin tone without masking things so it's not like a makeup or a cosmetic it simply helps to even out skin tone through that chromium these ingredients are evidence-based for rosacea so the formulation combines the wisdom of nature with the power of science to really deliver an effect product for our rosacea sufferers that takes the guesswork out of ingredients and navigating ingredient lists and in addition to those beneficial rosacea ingredients that I mentioned niacinamide licorice root extract and color correct and chromium this also is a nice rosacea friendly moisturizer in that it's got hyaluronic acid which is hydrating helps to hold on water into the skin as a humectant and has dimethicone and silicone ingredients which helped you seal in water into the skin and trap water there and prevent what's called trans epidermal water loss from the skin that could lead to dryness so this is a really nice lightweight and comfortable moisturizer to wear for people with rosacea or really honestly if you have redness in general it's also very good this product is oil-free it's not going to exacerbate and the acne clog pores it's non-comedogenic and I'm really comfortable to wear the way to use this is as a moisturizer to apply it immediately active cleansing your face to damp skin and allow it to dry you can apply it in the evening time after cleansing and then again in the morning after cleansing after after cleansing and applying this allow it to dry and then put your sunscreen on over for morning use I can buy it on amazon.com as well at CVS anyways guys that concludes the tips check the description box I will list the key features that I mentioned in today's video I hope it was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

        "transcript": "hi everybody and welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel if you have been here before today i'm going to be sharing my morning and nighttime skincare routine when it comes to mild rosacea so i haven't done this in a while i haven't sat down and shared my full skincare with you and because my skincare is kind of ever-changing i constantly add new products i do have my ride or die a little lineup that i use all the time but recently my skin has been going or through some changes i had a cold sore that was so bad and it took me weeks and weeks and weeks to heal it and hence i couldn't um couldn't really record any massages or the buckle massage that i keep promising you which will come after this video because i am going to film it today or tomorrow um but uh then i had some hormonal breakouts because um there were some changes with that as well no i'm not pregnant i will let you know when i am but otherwise i have been getting quite um big flare-ups of rosacea on my cheeks i get rosacea purely because of the food that i eat the stress and um there are lots of different factors that contribute to rosacea and rosacea really shows itself up by when the vessels the in your skin get bigger and the inflammation comes through usually it's around the cheeks but a lot of people actually don't know that they have rosacea because um they think they have acne and they can very much present themselves in very similar ways you can get little bumps on your cheeks that have little white heads you will see little capillaries and almost like broken capillaries on your skin of course you will have flushing there are so many different ways it can show up but there are also other things that show up that way you might just be reactive to spicy food or you might get flushed easily you know you can get redness in your cheeks depending on so many different aspects so um it's very much kind of an observation kind of situation you have to observe your skin a good idea as well is if you really want to understand your skin and your skin type is to keep a diary so what you have eaten what have you used what happened today with your skin how is it looking how is it feeling how are you feeling how much water have you drank and then you will see different effects that your skin might have so today my skin is pretty good because i have been using kind of a routine that i stuck to and my rosacea definitely got much better um this is still kind of healing because hormonal breakouts always take so long to heal i have been very good i haven't touched them but you know the scars will still take ages to heal and because i haven't really used acids and anything like that anything harsh recently because i've been clearing out the redness on my cheeks um that is why i haven't been able to fade the acne scars as much but i do use um kind of like local um local acids to get rid of those acne scars to resurface the skin so i'm going to talk you through my morning routine and this is not just for rosacea but if you do get redness in your cheeks if you have sensitivity in your skin this is a great way to build up the barrier and to moisturize and protect your skin i have already showered and cleansed my face and the cleanser that i'm using at the moment is the cerave hydrating cleanser this is for normal to dry skin comes with a pump super affordable it's kind of like a nice milky cleanser that looks like this and then it's low foaming i would say it does foam up a little bit but it's very good to um to use it if you don't wear a lot of makeup so it will kind of emolliate like this i will now have to go and wash my hands but it's very good to use in the morning if you do want to cleanse your face or just use water a lot of times i will just use water this is the cleanser that i kind of use morning and evening at the moment but i will show you in the evening another cleanser that i really like and use but this one is definitely um cerave in general because they have ceramides it's really really good to rebuild and re-strengthen the barrier of your skin then we're going to move into toner and the toner that i'm using at the moment is good molecules neocinamide brightening toner niacinamide is essentially a vitamin b3 and it is very good for hydration and also protecting your skin from kind of um environmental damage and it also helps with enlarged pores so what i do i just put a couple of drops into my hand it has almost a little bit of a thicker consistency than a normal toner and then i just press it into my skin everywhere and my neck and my chest like always remember this is the whole unit this is this is one um it doesn't come like this and then like that this is all one because the skin on your neck and your chest is very similar to your face so it will show signs of aging the same way okay so i really like this one again very affordable brand good molecules glass bottle dark glass bottle which is really nice and it's got vitamin c as well in it so it's nice to use in the morning if you're using spf but we will get to that and then we're going to go into a serum and this serum is one of the like the key main products um in my routine that i have introduced to reduce the inflammation and the redness and it's from face theory as a clear a15 serum so this is 15 azalea acid it also has um collodial oat aloe vera and green tea so azealic acid is a natural occurring acid and it is amazing at killing bacteria that causes acne and it causes rosacea so this has been fantastic to use it comes in a pump again a glass bottle so i just take a little pump it's like a liquidy white fluid and then i apply it on the areas of concern you can absolutely apply it everywhere and i just pat it and press it into my cheeks into my nose a little bit on my chin and on my temples because i get quite a lot of redness on my temples kind of like this area you can actually see it here um so this has been really really helpful and then i allow it to sink in for a couple of minutes i usually leave a couple of minutes between every step of my routine so i'm gonna let that sink in so acelic acid is just a really great ingredient for those anti-inflammatory purposes um and killing bacteria if you're suffering from acne or if you're suffering from rosacea or if you're not sure which one you have this is a great one to introduce into your routine i'm going to leave the links to all of the products that i'm showing in the description box below otherwise we're going to move on to an eye cream because i am still using an eye cream day and evening and the one that i'm loving at the moment is the aurelia brightening eye serum so it's a thinner lighter cream for your eyes it still has a really nice consistency but a lot of the eye creams that i see i find are quite heavy and almost difficult to spread around your eyes i will just apply it on my ring finger pat it around and then in circular motions around the eye i will apply it and then pat it in so a little bit of de-puffing a little bit of massage of course sometimes i go for a tiny little pinch this is great as well to wake up those blood vessels bring a bit more oxygen new blood to the skin you can literally pinch around your whole face pinching is great while that um serum is sinking in this is what i usually do i take the time to give my face a little pinch around the brows okay and then we're going to move on to the moisturizer and the moisturizer that i am loving loving loving at the moment is the taller rain from la roche posay la shapos they actually have a whole line purely for rosacea and i haven't actually tried that line um because i've started using this and i've kind of stuck to it and i was like i'm not buying any other you know products i'm not introducing anything new into my routine at the moment and this is a really great intense moisturizing cream and even if you have combination skin like i do um i think that it will not break it out because it has been amazing for me it hasn't broken me out once which is pretty incredible considering how reactive my skin normally is so comes in a pump again and it's quite a thick moisturizer so i do about like one and a half two pumps and then again just part it everywhere if i'm going on the neck and the chest i definitely do two pumps and then a bit of massage in the neck a bit of lymph stimulation there and then we're gonna press it into the face this has a hypoallergenic formula it is great for easily irritable sensitive skin if you are prone to oily skin this is really good as well and so i'm going to leave this in the description box as well because this has been my little hero so it definitely keeps my skin soothed and moisturized at the same time and then after the um the moisturizer has sunk in i move on to my spf i am still using my tried and trusted environment spf 15. this is for winter and i find that that is enough for me um and i have been using these sunscreen for probably six years now if you have been watching my channel for a while you would have seen environ in the early stages of my channel and i still use their moisturizer i am on stage three or four at the moment so i have stepped up the amount of vitamin a that i have in the cream i still use their serums and i still love the brand very much um but the spf is definitely in my daily routine so it has a nice creamy consistency uh it doesn't give you a white cast so i just kind of do probably like the length of almost two fingers that's how much uh spf you need so i'm gonna apply it everywhere and again i just pat it in i don't really rub it into my skin i just pat it in and on my neck even though my neck doesn't really get exposed these days because i wear big jumpers with turtleneck and scarves and massive jackets because it has been so cold which doesn't help the rosacea situation for sure and then i pat the um the excess into my hands sometimes i do this if it's feeling a little bit too much like i have applied too much and that is pretty much it i also wanted to mention a supplement that i'm taking at the moment and it's the aurelia beauty and immunity support so this is probiotics with zinc and both of those for me are kind of like a must supplement that you should take if you um care for the health of your gut and if you care for the health of your skin the health of your skin is pretty much directly linked to the health of your gut and so is your immune system so if you're taking probiotics and your gut is healthy and your diet is balanced and then that will very much show up on your skin on your like whole well-being and the way that you feel and this has really been fantastic i too i take two of these a day that my friends is my morning routine and i will catch up with you in the evening for my nighttime routine um this video might be incredibly long which i apologize for but i've got a lot to say maybe i will maybe i will actually split it in two videos because um i feel like i just blab on but otherwise if you have any questions um or anything at all to let me know about please let me know in the comment section below check the description box for all the links and i will see you guys very soon in my next video or in the evening bye",

        "transcript": "hello everyone i'm dr anjali khadke i'm an aesthetic dermatologist practicing in south mumbai since past 12 years today we are going to discuss the anti-aging skincare regime for rosacea prone skin or very sensitive skin so before we look into the skin care regime we will first understand what is rosacea so rosacea is nothing but a inflammatory skin condition which is characterized by basically redness of the face which is also associated with trigger-based flushing what does that mean it means that the skin becomes red on some occasions like maybe when you have hot spicy food or when there's change of emotions becomes a little red or pink and then it settles down there's also something called as a capillary bust you see small capillaries bursting onto the skin it is also associated with textural changes of the skin what is that the skin becomes a little thickened there is enlarged pores and also it is associated with acne so these acnes are like maybe popular or pustular but they won't be in the blackhead or whitehead form so this is how rosacea presents itself now when we look at the skincare regime you have to first understand that the threshold of the skin is really less in a rosacea patient so when you have to go on to the skincare regime it has to be very very mild kind of a skincare regime cleansers have to be a gentle hydrating cleansers so that they don't irritate the skin you can choose somewhere from cetaphil to second is the exfoliation if you're thinking about exfoliation you want to you might want to try beta hydroxy acid like the salicylic acid rather than the alpha hydroxy acid which is like the glycolic acid third is moisturizers so moisturizers are must in a rosacea patient because the skin is really dry so you might want to look for something which is ceramides or glycerin or hyaluronic acid in the moisturizer now forth comes to active ingredients should you or should you not use active ingredients for a rosacea patient because they have very sensitive skin now the question is very tricky there's no the answer for this question because it depends if your skin threshold allows you to do it you can start with a mild active ingredient when i say mild what does that mean if a take an example of a retinoid cream suppose a point five percent retinoid cream we want to apply what you will do is take a delob a small amount of retinoid cream mix it with equal amount of moisturizer so that 0.5 becomes 0.25 another way of doing this is that whatever mixture you have you can just start applying from the lateral areas of the face which have less inflammation and not go very vigorous with the central part of the face this is one way of applying active ingredients but you need to take a call depending on the skin sensitivity and how you tolerate the agent now next is sunscreen so sunscreen is a must use a broad spectrum sunscreen anywhere from spf 30 onwards you can choose for your skin now what are the don'ts for an rosacea prone skin is basically you do not use any brushes because they tend to cause a lot of irritation to the skin and may aggravate the condition so use sponge which is more mild for the skin second don't do any mechanical exfoliation because they tend to again irritate the skin more third avoid any factor which leads to increase in redness of the face so make sure you know what are the factors that tend to increase the redness and then you can take care accordingly",

        "published_at": "2021-06-23T13:00:10Z",
        "transcript": "so many of you have been requesting videos on rosacea especially since i talked about it being a skin condition that i personally struggle with so i thought a good place to start is to tell you a little bit about what rosacea is and some do's and don'ts to follow if you have rosacea i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and find skincare products that work for you first of all what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic but treatable skin condition that typically involves the face now i say treatable and not curable because sometimes patients will come see me in my office expect to get a treatment regimen for three to four months for their rosacea and then never deal with it again and the reality is that rosacea is a lifelong condition and there will be times when it's flaring and there will be times when it's under really good control but the goals of rosacea management aren't to get rid of it because there's no cure but to manage it in a way where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life and where you're happy with your skin it's a persistent inflammatory skin condition meaning that it often presents with redness and irritation and i'll talk a little bit more about the signs and symptoms of rosacea in a minute but it also affects men and women the women slightly more than men and it is really a disease of adults so the onset of rosacea is usually after the age of 30. more than 16 million americans have rosacea that's about 1 in 20 people and we think that globally about 5.5 percent of the world's population also has rosacea rosacea symptoms can include easily flushing or blushing persistent facial redness visible vessels on the skin surface easily irritated skin scaly skin dry skin itchy skin it also can affect the eyes so some people will get grittiness or irritation in their eyes and the last thing is that rosacea can have pimples and so it is often misdiagnosed as acne someone with rosacea might just have one or two of those symptoms and someone might have all of the things i just listed so it really can exist on a spectrum of severity but also the presentation can vary widely from person to person one question i get all the time is why do i have rosacea what is causing it is it something that i am doing and oftentimes it's not it we know that rosacea is caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors but a lot of times people don't have full control over those and so it's not about what's causing your rosacea at that point it's more about you have rosacea what are we going to do about it and it's great that we have awesome treatments to help get rosacea under control for people and manage those signs and symptoms so they're not suffering from their skin condition on a day-to-day basis prior to just a few years ago we used to categorize people with rosacea based on kind of the main signs or symptoms that they were presenting with i'm gonna go over those four categorizations even though we don't really use those clinically anymore because i do think it helps people understand the signs and symptoms that rosacea can present with but just know we don't use those categorizations anymore because we understand that people with rosacea can kind of have overlapping symptoms that span more than one category the first of sort of these four categories of rosacea is something called erythematolangictatic rosacea and really what this means is rosacea presenting with facial redness and typically this is redness in the center of the face so the chin the cheeks the nose and the forehead and this is redness that is often present at baseline but then gets worse with flushing or blushing based on exposure to certain triggers and then with that flushing or blushing you can also have altered sensations of the skin like sensitivity stinging burning or sort of this overwhelming heat sensation the other thing that can happen with this erythematologic rosacea is the presence of telangiectasias which are dilated blood vessels that are visible on the skin surface the second prior subtype of rosacea was something called papulopustular rosacea and really this was rosacea presenting with red bumps or red pustules which are red bumps filled with pus this is the type of rosacea or a feature of rosacea that is most commonly mistaken or mistreated as acne so it's something that's important for your doctor to be able to recognize the third prior categorization of rosacea was something called thymidus rosacea also called rhinophyma when it specifically involved the nose but really this is the development of sort of a thick bumpy texture to the skin and it's not a common feature of rosacea but it's certainly something to keep an eye out for the fourth category of rosacea was ocular rosacea or rosacea involving the eye this will often present as irritation light sensitivity watering eyes a gritty sensation in the eye but like i said before we are not using these four categorizations anymore we know that people can have redness and eye symptoms or feminist features and papules and pustules so it's more about what each unique person is presenting with when we're diagnosing and treating their rosacea so let's get into the do's and don'ts of rosacea i just want to put a caveat here though that these are guidelines they are not strict rules i know i'm a physician i'm a board certified dermatologist and i'm telling you these things about rosacea but just know that everyone's skin is different and if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is fine it's no big deal but these might be things that are worth thinking about if your rosacea is not under optimal control and you're trying to figure out ways for you to intervene and make a meaningful positive difference see a dermatologist we are able to accurately diagnose and give you a treatment plan for your rosacea i cannot tell you how many times i've seen rosacea misdiagnosed as acne lupus an allergic reaction eczema seborrheic dermatitis if your face is red or bumpy or sensitive and you don't know why get the help of an expert to make sure you're treating the right thing get to know your rosacea triggers and then avoid those triggers so although we don't know all of the causes of rosacea we do know certain environmental factors make rosacea worse and they can really vary from person to person so things like sun exposure hot or cold weather stress alcohol chocolate dairy spicy foods i mean the list goes on and it really is unique to each person what i recommend is that if you're not sure what your triggers are keep a rosacea diary any time your rosacea is flaring write down what you ate what you drink and what your surrounding environment is like being more aware of your triggers and avoiding them will absolutely help your rosacea stay under better control protect your skin from the sun so wide brim hats please and then sunscreen every single day now i used to tell my rosacea patients to use mineral-based sunscreens only so those with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as the uv filters because we thought they were maybe a little bit less irritating but what i found over time is that a lot of my rosacea patients can tolerate chemical uv filters in their sunscreen just fine so rather than limiting my patients sunscreen options i let them know that it might be a little bit of trial and error to find a sunscreen that they love but once they do use it every day keep your skin well moisturized people with rosacea often will have some skin barrier disruption and be more prone to barrier disruption even if they're using gentle skin care so using a nice moisturizer that feels good on your skin that doesn't cause stinging every single day and maybe sometimes twice a day if you're feeling particularly dry will help your skin feel better and look better too and my final do is have realistic expectations of what's achievable when treating rosacea typically the goals should be to have fewer flares and have your symptoms be well managed but if your goal is to have zero evidence that you've ever had rosacea you're really likely to be disappointed and i'm not saying that to be debbie downer dermatologist over here but if you focus on incremental improvement you're much more likely to find success in your treatment and be happier for it let's get into the don'ts i feel like i have to say this one more time before i get into the don'ts which is if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is totally fine that's okay keep doing it these are not rosacea laws these are just recommendations don't overheat your skin or expose it to extreme temperatures now this can be tricky to do all of the time but we do know that really cold weather and wind as well as really hot weather and indoor heating can all flare rosacea don't rub or scrub the face so any type of physical manipulation or physical exfoliation can cause increased redness and irritation so that goes for physical exfoliants like microbeads or scrubs as well as even like the rough fibers of a towel rubbed on the face they can all cause increased irritation so pat your face dry don't aggressively massage it just be nice to your skin don't use too many products a simple skincare regimen really is best especially if you're incorporating prescription topical medications to treat your rosacea you really don't want to be layering product after product after product you also might be sensitive to certain products so doing a little patch test in front of your ear or on your jawline for several days before kind of using it all over your entire face is not a bad idea don't use certain skin care ingredients that are known to trigger rosacea not every person with rosacea is going to be sensitive to the same types of skincare ingredients but in a survey conducted by the national rosacea society there were some ingredients that more people tended to be sensitive to and those are things like alcohol witch hazel fragrance menthol peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil there are other types of skin care ingredients like tretinoin and retinoids salicylic acid glycolic acid benzoyl peroxide antioxidants and topical vitamin c and people want to know i have rosacea those things can be irritating can i use them and really it's on a case-by-case basis one thing i recommend is never introducing more than one active to your regimen at once so if you're thinking okay i want to introduce a retinoid go low and slow and kind of see how it works out for you i use tretinoin in my routine even though i have rosacea but i could not do that initially i had to get my rosacea under really good control before i could incorporate that ingredient i never want to say anything is truly off limits for my rosacea patients but just know that you have to use things like acids or exfoliators with caution and understand that even if you can't tolerate them at this point in your rosacea journey you might be able to in the future don't be afraid to use prescription medication i find that sometimes in clinic i meet resistance from patients who just want to use over-the-counter options but this is a true skin disease and i don't find that most of my patients want over-the-counter options for their other types of diseases that they have skin disease should be no different don't be afraid of the prescriptions they are really developed for the treatment of rosacea they have been well studied give them a shot and my final don't is if you have rosacea and you have not been able to get it under control don't feel hopeless okay team up with a dermatologist maybe get a second opinion and also understand that rosacea is constantly being researched we are learning more about this condition day by day and as we move forward we are going to have even better treatments and interventions to offer what tips have helped you with your rosacea put them in the comments below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see you next time",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video I'm going to share with you a simple straightforward effective skincare routine for clearing up blackheads white heads acne breakouts and for rosacea and that really stubborn cousin of rosacea perioral dermatitis this is a really easy routine anybody can do it doesn't require a lot of advanced thinking planning layering give this video a thumbs up if you like simple straightforward No Nonsense skincare routines that don't require like a lot of advanced thinking planning tons of products cluttering your shell I'm going to be using one of my favorite ingredients it's very underrated it's sulfur in the de la Cru maximum strength acne treatment this is a 10% sulfur mask I'm going to show you how to use it and while I do it I'm going to explain how it works what the benefits are and what to expect you want to get started by first washing your face you can just use a mild gentle cleanser I'm using this one by Neutrogena a favorite of mine the hydroboost with hyaluronic acid hydrating Gel Cleanser fragrance-free importantly when you wash your face always make sure to use lukewarm to Cool Water using really hot water not only can dry out the skin but actually can be really aggravating to conditions like rosacea and perioral dermatitis you want to make sure to pat dry the skin if your skin is soaking wet this product is probably not going to set up as as well now that my skin is clean and there's no water residue left on the surface this product is going to go on a lot more evenly a lot more smoothly to use this you just need about a pearl sized amount and you're going to apply a thin film to the face now I'm going to put it to my entire face sparing around my eyes common mistake people make when it comes to Skin Care is putting on a big glob all you really need is a very thin film of this it has a very moisturizing texture make sure to get my nose cheek area so as soon as you've applied this in a thin film to the entire face sparing the area around your eyes you're going to set a timer for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes I'll go ahead and do 15 while the timer is going we're going to talk about what what exactly this is doing what it's helpful for what to expect sulfur why would you want to use that in a skincare routine it has a lot of benefits for the skin if you weren't aware it's anti-inflammatory and it's antimicrobial it can help reduce the acne causing bacteria cutie bacterium acnes and it can also help control certain microbes on the skin surface that can aggravate conditions like rosacea your skin has these little mites hello kind of freaks people out they're called Demodex mites but in Ros part of the skin problem where you get these inflamed red spots is thought to be due to an abnormal response to those little mites and sulfur can actually help with that sulfur is also chotic meaning it basically unclogs pores it does this because the sulfur is thought to interact with cysteine the amino acid and the keratins in your skin helping to basically break up the glue between cells that are kind of stuck together in your pore the benefit of doing that is unclogging pores so you can see Improvement in blackheads and white heads otherwise known as open and closed comeone so for example if you get a lot of Comey dones on your forehead this may help you out if you get a lot of blackheads on your nose this is something to consider because sulfur is both anti-inflammatory and because it can help reduce the burden of the acne causing bacterium cutie bacterium acnes this can be a particularly valuable mask to consider incorporating into your skincare routine if you have acne whether it be acne that is predominant L hormonal maybe predominantly localized to the jawline maybe you have comedonal acne that's aggravated by hair styling products on your forehead and you're trying to clear that up or maybe you have acne on your body like your chest or your back you don't have to just do this to the face this product can help with those things sulfur is really underrated by and large some of the things I really like about sulfur and this mask in particular are that it's pretty easy to tolerate it's very gentle on the skin I mean it's well tolerated by by people who have the sensitive skin condition rosacea I also like that this product can be used alongside other treatments what we're doing here in this routine is essentially a form of short contact therapy what is short contact therapy essentially what it sounds like putting an active ingredient on the skin leaving it there for a defined period of time and then rinsing it off the advantages of short contact therapy are that you get the ingredient on the skin you derive the benefits but you minimize any side effects of dryness that's what we're doing here I've got a lot of videos talking about short contact therapy on this channel whether it be with troan or other acne ingredients like benzol peroxide so check those out but today we're basically doing a form of short contact therapy in contrast to some of those other active ingredients that we've talked about with short contact therapy though I want to emphasize that sulfur is pretty gentle on the skin it's actually kind of soothing the main side effects of using the sulfur mask are it can be drying some people find their skin itches when they use it and probably the thing that bothers people the most is the odor some people find that it smells like rotting eggs other people note that it smells like a match head basically the smell of sulfur now we're going to rinse this off the skin surface in my opinion I don't smell any residual sulfur odor using this product after I rinse it off but I have gotten comments over the years from people who are like I use that and every time I use it my husband or partner they tell me that my face smells like eggs so just a word of warning it can leave a foul odor on the skin surface that a lot of people don't care for but as I mentioned you can use it alongside other active ingredients it doesn't counteract other active ingredients and because it's relatively gentle overall I mean it may be a little drying but overall it's pretty gentle you can use it alongside other active ingredients for either acne rosacea perioral dermatitis for example in the case of acne you could use this mask rinse it off as we're going to do in a moment and you'll see see me do that you can rinse it off and then you can use your other acne treatments whether it be bzal peroxide troin aoic acid um topical dapsone you can also use treatments for rosacea along with this whether be topical icin which is sold by the brand named cilantro or topical metronidazol this is not going to get in the way of that it's gentle enough that you can actually do this on a daily basis comment below have you ever dealt with a bout of peroral dermatitis otherwise known as per orificial dermatitis it can be very frustrating and uncomfortable as the name implies often involves the skin around the mouth although it can involve the skin around the nose and around the eyes periorificial dermatitis is notoriously difficult to tackle head on and majority of skincare products actually end up irritating that condition but sulfur is something that is prudent to consider in the routine to address that condition again it is thought to be related to rosace the anti-inflammatory properties of sulfur are what is thought to be responsible for improvement in periorificial dermatitis with sulfur so in summary benefits that you might observe with a product like this are fewer breakouts fewer blackheads fewer white heads in the case of rosacea fewer papules which are those red bumps fewer pules which are those white pus fill bumps similarly with periorificial dermatitis you may note Improvement in the number of red bumps that you get with that condition and an overall just Improvement in the sensitivity that you experience with those little bumps if you've ever had that again those bumps they can sting and be really uncomfortable what if you don't have acne rosacea or periorificial dermatitis can this still be helpful certainly can it's chotic properties can help improve the appearance of pores does this have any anti-aging properties to it no there's nothing about this that combats skin aging how often can you do this mask you can do it as often as you tolerate it you actually can do it on a daily basis either as part of your morning skincare routine or part of your evening skincare routine and truthfully if you're motivated you can do it two to three times a day as tolerated so what I suggest is that try using it once a day for the first couple of weeks see how you do with it if it's too drying maybe go to using it every other day but if you tolerate it fine consider increasing it to using it twice a day by increasing the number of times a day that you use it you may note that that you get a faster onset of improvement of things like red bumps pules blackheads and white heads again everything in the skin takes time but by increasing the frequency as tolerated you may know that you get to those results faster than doing it at a more conservative Pace now if you'll recall from my video on short contact therapy one of the things I really like about it is that it gives the individual a lot of control and tweaking the duration of contact you can start out really conservative leaving this on on the skin surface for 10 minutes and then increase the duration of contact you may find that initially you only tolerate wearing it for 10 minutes and that it's too drying but with time you are able to tolerate it better outwards to 15 and 20 minutes and then again increasing from just using it once a day a few times a week to daily to twice a day I mean really it's going to be something that you can guide people who have drier skin maybe are more sensitive those that tend to be more on the rosaceous side of things they may find they have to be more conservative whereas people who have really inflamed acne they may find that they need to be a bit more aggressive and use it more frequently the spots of acne they can be quite thickened and so the penetration of this can be a little slow in those areas so by using it more frequently you may get to the end point that you're looking for faster okay now that the 15 minutes are up I'm going to rinse this off the skin surface something really nice about this product is you don't don't need to use cleanser to rinse it off the skin it's water soluble meaning it'll come off with water now you certainly can use a gentle cleanser if you find that that works for you I would suggest though just using water because the more times you wash your face with a cleanser that can end up drying out your skin too much and as I said sulfur can be a little drying to begin with and again cool to lukewarm water we're not going to go boiling the stratum corium here all right so now that I've rinse that off we're going to come in with the final step of this very simple straightforward routine and that is to apply a moisturizer if this is part of your evening routine or a moisturizing sunscreen if this is part of your daytime routine doesn't matter what the product is so long as you like it and it doesn't bother your skin I'm using the hadot amuji skin conditioning gel by nuturi this is a really lightweight hydrating gel it's beneficial in that it's going to replenish any moisture that I lost from washing my face and it's going to help keep the Skin Barrier protected and hydrated to minimize any potential drying side effects from The sulfur mask with moisturizer you only need a nickel to Dime sized amount again you don't need a big glob on there of course it's going to depend a bit on the consistency of the moisturizer that you're using so you can always add a little bit more if you feel that you need to but you don't need to go on in with a big glob from the get-go it just will end up wasting things now if I were doing this as part of my morning routine I would pat dry the skin completely and I would come in with a moisturizing sunscreen if you guys missed my video on the pure screen Plus Mineral tinted sunscreens from Neutrogena definitely check those out but these would be a great option if you have especially if you have very sensitive skin they're mineral sunscreens they're less likely to sting and burn in comparison to the All chemical sunscreen and you have four different shades to choose from there so that would be a great option okay where do you get this Dayla Cru sulfur oy you can get it a lot of places it can be a little hard to find cuz they sometimes put it like down at the bottom shelf but you can buy it at Walmart you can buy it at Kroger grocery stores I've seen uh Target you can also get it at like Walgreens r a CVS or you can get it on the Amazonian so it's pretty inexpensive and you don't need a lot of this you also as I mentioned earlier in the video You could also use this product to like the chest the back anywhere where you have breakouts this could be used and it can be helpful it can be used under the arms too if you find that you get painful breakouts there maybe related to hyro adenitis you may find that this is beneficial in those areas it can be very soothing and anti-inflammatory can this product be used if you were pregnant always discuss that with your treating healthcare provider but by and large sulfur is is considered to be safe to use in pregnancy can you use a sulfur mask if you are allergic to sulfa s u LFA the answer is yes sulfur is not the same as sulfa sulfa is a class of antibiotics that some people are allergic to but this does not crossreact with that okay I'm going to wrap this video up here I really hope that this was helpful to you guys straightforward effective three-step routine for acne rosacea paroral dermatitis really anyone could benefit from this routine if you're looking to incorporate sulfur in for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits um now on the end slate I'm going to link my video on how to do short contact therapy with benzo peroxide it's a great way to use benzol peroxide for your acne derive the benefits of that ingredient but minimize the drying effects benzo peroxide in contrast to sulfur can be a lot more drying and irritating so watch that one next especially if you're coping with acne breakouts but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] h [Music]",

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can check it out also if you want to Deep dive on information about any of these skin conditions you can actually search Cassandra Banks and rosacea or Cassandra bankson sunburn or Cassandra bankson skin condition in the YouTube search bar and we've probably done a video on it specifically if you search Cassandra bankson how to treat a sunburn I've shared with you some of my best tips and tricks as well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this

        "transcript": "I'm back with another affordable skincare routine this is a morning routine focused on repairing Your Skin [Music] Barrier if you're new to the channel welcome I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good don't forget to subscribe to the channel and like this video I'm actually thrilled that people are coming around to the idea of supporting and repairing their skin barrier now it is a little bit redundant to say Skin Barrier because in and of itself skin is a barrier it's what divides your external World from your insides that being said your skin is made up of several different cellular layers and as you get closer to the surface of the skin or those outermost cellular layers those are the skin cells that serve the most protective role so really when we're talking about repairing and protecting the Skin Barrier we are talking about using products and using skin practices that help keep that surface layer of skin cells intact the way I like to describe it to my patients is your outermost layer of skin cells are like bricks and those bricks or skin cells are held together by mortar and in your skin that mortar is made up of a complex of proteins and lipids or proteins and fats now when you have a disruption in Your Skin Barrier it can be because the cells themselves or the bricks have an issue or it can be because the mortar or the protein and lipid complex that is holding those skin cells or bricks together has an issue and sometimes it can be both in fact in the world of medical Dermatology there are numerous skin disorders in which people are unable to produce these proteins and fats that create Their Skin Barrier or they produce dysfunctional proteins or fats and because of this these people often will have skin dryness skin flaking blistering skin fragility increased skin infections Etc because they are unable to create a strong Skin Barrier to protect themselves now something that's much more common than being born with a Skin Barrier disorder is actually being born with healthy fully functioning skin but then doing something to your skin for example overe exfoliating that then goes and disrupts that Skin Barrier and I feel like we've all done that before we think we're doing a skincare routine that's going to help us with our fine lines and wrinkles or our acne and we wake up the next day and our skin feels dry and tight it might be red it might be flaking it might be burning and stinging when we put our products on and that's a sign that our Skin Barrier is struggling and since most of us have been in that situation before and I'm assuming you have because you're watching this video I wanted to give you a skincare routine that you can use to help restore or repair Your Skin Barrier and give you one that's affordable okay let's get into the routine I wanted to make you a morning routine because I feel like there's a good number of nighttime skincare barrier repair routines out there and of course if you want me to make you one of those I certainly can but Skin Barrier repair needs to be in the morning as well and one of the core principles of skin barrier repair is eliminating actives from your routine so at night that means getting rid of your retinoids and maybe your exfoliating acids and often in the morning that means taking out vitamin C because that is a skincare active and it can be irritating for a lot of people so less is best when it comes to repairing your barrier okay so first step in a routine cleansing now I'm going to recommend that if your Skin Barrier is disrupted and it's not feeling great that you just cleanse with water yes that is perfectly okay and I've had so many people tell me that just by changing their routine from washing twice a day to just washing in the evening has made their skin less sensitive and overall feel better so I just have some lukewarm water running here and I'm just going to get my hands wet and just sort of massage that into my face I don't need to wash off the products I wore last night they've sort of rubbed off on my pillow or absorbed into my skin by now and then I'm going to gently Pat my skin dry No harsh rubbing okay okay first step of my morning routine is done and it cost absolutely nothing so I feel like we're staying on budget so for most days at this point in my routine I would go in with my vitamin C but again we're skipping all skincare actives so instead while my skin is still I'm going to go in with a hydrating skin serum and just to give you a preview I'm going to go in with a hydrating serum then a moisturizer then a sunscreen and depending on what your skin is feeling like whether you tend to lean oily or dry or are acne prone or just how many products you want to have in your routine some of these steps are optional I would say sunscreen is never optional but whether you do a hydrating serum and then your sunscreen or just a moisturizer and then your sunscreen or do all three steps like I'm going to demonstrate for you today you just want to make sure that your including steps only because you need them and not just because you think you should have them in your routine so reasons why you might want to do a serum and a moisturizer because for a lot of people a moisturizer is going to be absolutely enough and for some people even just using their sunscreen as their moisturizer will be completely adequate but I like to go in with a hydrating serum because often times in these hydrating serums one of the principal ingredients is something called A humant and A humant is just a category of skincare ingredients that helps draw water to the Skin's surface and I find When My Skin Barrier is disrup Ed my skin tends to look a little bit depleted it looks dry the fine lines are emphasized like my skin just doesn't look great and so I like using a hydrating serum to help bring that water to my skin surface to plump it out a bit also depending on which serum you're using it may have additional beneficial skincare ingredients that are not contained within your moisturizer or within your sunscreen so it's an opportunity to introduce new beneficial skincare ingredients into your routine so today I'm going in with the aino calm and restore triple oat serum and I believe this retail anywhere from $15 to $20 depending on where you're buying it from as the name of the product suggests it's meant to calm and restore your skin bear now this dropper mechanism not my favorite but not horrible you can see it's on the thicker side but when you go to spread it so smooth it's great and I find that this layers really well with moisturizer and other products so I like to kind of put it on right away while my skin is damp to really trap that moisture there so for my face I'm probably going to put at least one dropper I think I need a second one all right two droppers full massage it on so this has glycerin which is the humant ingredient that I was talking about before that helps draw water to your skin surface and helps plump it out a little bit aeno is also pretty well known for including oat derivatives in its products and oats have soothing properties they have antioxidant properties so that's also all going to help restore your Skin Barrier so I'm just sort of massaging this around pressing it into my skin and of course bringing it down the neck so I found with using this product it feels a little bit tacky or sticky to the touch for about 30 seconds and then it pretty much completely dries down and once it's drag down then I go in with the third step of my routine so first step was cleanse with water Second Step hydrating serum and now moisturizer the moisturizer I'm going to go in with today is the deride relief barrier moisturizer what an appropriate Name by purito this is like a good siiz moisturizer you get a lot of product in here I think it retails for about 20 bucks and I'll just show you the texture here it's thick and creamy but I find not too heavy so I can wear it during the day but absolutely could use this as a nighttime moisturizer as well I feel like it sort of straddles the Daytime Nighttime moisturizer thickness quite well and you can see rubs in beautifully I'm going to use about a pump a little more than a p sized amount perhaps at night I tend to use more moisturizer and during the day I tend to use if I'm using moisturizer at all a smaller amount and the reason for that is I'm going to go in with another layer of skincare afterward my sunscreen and I just find that if I use a ton of moisturizer and then try to put my sunscreen on top I just I don't like how it feels on my skin and then sometimes I also can get peeling of the product where it starts to ball up into these little white balls on the skin and that's not cute super annoying you have to restart start your skincare routine so just a dim sized amount of moisturizer for me today again don't forget the neck there we go while I'm waiting for this moisturizer to dry down a little bit before I go in with my sunscreen I'll tell you the reason why I like this particular moisturizer so much is because of the valuable skincare ingredients that it has that support the Skin Barrier it contains some calming plant oils it also has allantoin and squalene and cholesterol and then the main sort of selling point of this moisturizer is the variety of ceramides that it contains and remember back at the beginning of this video when I was talking about how your skin cells are like the bricks of Your Skin Barrier and then you have this complex of fats and proteins that form the mortar to seal those skin cells or those bricks together well ceramides are a key component of that lipid protein matrix that helps seal your barrier so when your Skin Barrier is depleted or not functioning in an ideal way using products that have ceramides in them can help repair that barrier and bring it back to its original function and with that we will move on to the fourth and final step of this affordable morning skincare routine to support your Skin Barrier and of course we're going to end with the best it's sunscreen now a lot of people don't realize that your Skin Barrier actually helps protect your deeper layers of skin from UV damage so when you have a disrupted Skin Barrier your ability for your skin to protect itself from UV radiation goes down so sunscreen of course is going to be essential for skin barrier repair routine in the morning and honestly for any skin routine in the morning the sunscreen I'm going to use today is a Korean sunscreen it's from a brand called called belflower it's the avocado moisture sunscreen SPF 50 pa+++ plus let's get this on I just put a layer of that sunscreen on and totally didn't record it so I'm going to go in and put another layer on for you but you can see it leaves a really nice dewy finish and that's one thing I really like about this sun green is it's very lightweight but feels quite hydrating on the skin it has some amazing UV filters in it and it also has some great ingredients that help support Your Skin Barrier so it has niacinamide it has cantella asiatica which is anti-inflammatory and I think most importantly it just goes on so well and that might sound silly to prioritize that above all else when it comes to sunscreen but the best sunscreen is the one you will wear so finding one that has a texture that you like is essential so that's all dried down now I think it has a really beautiful Luminous Finish and for a dry skinned gal like me that is basically ideal I forgot to mention that this sunscreen generally retails from anywhere between 122 and $15 so highly affordable which I also love because I don't want anyone skimping on their sunscreen or even worse skipping their sunscreen because it's too expensive everyone should be able to afford sunscreen okay you've reached the end of this routine I hope you found it helpful if you want to see other types of affordable skincare routines let me know in the comments so I can make those for you also if you have any skin barrier repair products that you love throw them in the comments as well as always thank you so much for

        "transcript": "[Music] hi guys welcome back we have another dermatologist skincare reaction we also have board-certified dermatologist dr. Annie Chu thanks for having me back thanks for being back here so she's got her own practice called the Durham Institute in Redondo Beach if you're out that way definitely check out what she's doing we'll leave all her information below in the description box today we are looking at Anna she is 21 and she is dealing with acne but she's gonna get into it and I'm curious to hear what you have to say this video is a prime example of why I think it's important for these videos specifically to have a board-certified dermatologists like you a real expert and I'm not saying I'm not an expert but I'm more of a skincare enthusiast and it's one thing for me to judge a person especially a celebrity or an influencers skincare routine and talk to you guys about ingredients and how it's working with the skin type but when there's an underlying skin issue I do feel like it's important to see an actual professional for that stuff right yeah and I think it's great because then you know your viewers can relate to some of the things that everyday people struggle with not everyone is perfect skin yeah it's true it's true so you want to get started you want to see what a does dealing has that's right hi my name is Anna I'm 21 years old and I live in Germany it's a skincare video and at first I'm gonna show you my skin I have a combination to oily skin type with an oily t-zone and my main concern is as you can see acne I have whiteheads and sometimes hormonally pimples and now I'm gonna show what I used for my skincare is she not cute as a button she's adorable I want to be like I know you so she's saying that she's dealing with acne and whiteheads and sometimes hormonal acne so this is when I think it's very important to have a professional like you to look at skin like this because you know she's got something going like usually you can look at someone who says they have acne and if it's like in a specific area it could be like oh that's hormonal over the tiny moon acne but this is one where I wouldn't even tell her go see an aesthetician like some people I know when they tell me they're dealing with acne and I look at them I'm like oh go see this aesthetician 3-months facials you'll be cleared yeah but then there are cases like this where I see all these little things happening around her skin where I'm like I think you need to see a dermatologist so I agree I think she's got a little bit of a mixed picture and to be honest I think it's hard for me to diagnose off YouTube like I won't be able to ask her some prompting questions here but what I see is not typical for more likely she may have additional hormonal breakouts but it's a little bit beyond that that it's you know there's more involvement I'm mostly with a central face and there's some degree of underlying redness so I'd venture to say she let's see what she says but she could have just regular acne but she's a little old different regular acne as well I think she could have some combo of acne and rosacea so rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition and there's all these different subtypes there subtypes are just characterized by chronic redness and then there's actually an inflammatory subtype that is characterized by little inflamed bums that look almost exactly like acne so it's really hard and frankly we have a diagnosis called acne rosacea because it's a little bit of a spectrum to kind of put these people in one category and my guess is she falls in that spectrum and I think it's extra hard for them because typically associate acne with being really and you'll lean yourself towards release stripping drying products because you're trying to dry it out unlike a lot of exfoliator that kind of stuff exactly but the problem is acne rosacea is acne on very sensitive easily irritable skin right and you can terribly inflame that and cause yourself a little bit of more inflammation trial inflammation dry out kind of cycle yeah and the inflammation is that because that leads to so much more problems down low down along it yeah and she could because she's only 21 there this might be an ACME dominant but there's underlying rosacea skin she will actually probably veer towards that no matter what yeah so it's probably good to look at the routine and make sure that we're setting her up for success even later on definitely so I do want to point out we do always follow up with everybody really quickly before we actually get on camera just to make sure we ask some of these questions she has been to a dermatologist in the past year she said I think they had given her clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide clindamycin this topical antibiotic with a little benzoyl peroxide she said they gave her a lighter percentage and it wasn't that effective and they also gave her something called azelaic acid yeah which you'll find in some over-the-counter products but prescription wise here in the US it's called Phoenicia and it's actually a cream that's prescribed for rosacea so my guess is that her dermatologist in Europe might have been struggling with which bucket to put her in as well because that sounds like you know that kind of an in-between regimen because there's not retinoid in there right yeah and rosacea patients don't do well with yeah sensitive very sensitive and this is why you're saying it's also difficult for you to just look at her video and be like what is going on so I've been true to say she's probably one of those people that can potentially hop around to a few dermatologists before she finds a solution right yeah and I think she does need to see a dermatologist better seen in person and in their triggers like is this worse than the Sun is this worse with like stress when you drink coffee woods do you tend to flush those are trigger questions or rosacea so she answered yes to any of those i but i definitely be like okay this is like definitely an acne rosacea versus a classic acne which we actually call acne vulgaris vulgaris is award for common in medicine so acne vulgaris is like the classic actually that we all think of the 16 year old with the whiteheads on the face but you know I'm guessing let's see that she will struggle with trying to balance oil and sensitivity which is very very difficult so let's see how she does all right let's do this well my night time skincare I start with double cleansing my skin I used this clinic take the day of cleansing balm and as a second step I use this set of Filkins lotion so she uses a clinic take the day off balm I know a lot of people love this balm it works really well it doesn't take your makeup off I don't know how much makeup she's wearing during the day and then she's going into just good old good old-fashioned Cetaphil until Cetaphil uh-huh so what do you think about the combination for her I love the Clinique but I don't know for her Clinique I find is a skincare brand that my younger patients with oily skin sort of geared towards because it was marketed towards like a younger as they Lauder type of thing right and I find that people then become really bonded to it whether or not they have oily skin I mean I'm one of those people I started when I was twelve yes mom took me to the counter yeah she was like it's like a luxury and again yeah she needs to get on to a routine let's see so it's got a little safflower so it's it's basically a hydrating mom I think this is a good product for her it's gentle it's non stripping and skin barrier health is the most important thing for her right so I think actually that with the Cetaphil is a really smart combination Cetaphil is one of those things like it's a product that we always just kind of have in our household we put a link in showers and stuff like that for guests or like I forget to like transfer my cleanser to the shower it's just sitting there and I'll use it I feel like it's just one of those things dermatologists always are like yeah sort of feels fine for almost everybody because Lee but I put it in a video once and there is a lot of backlash about it because they're like it's not good for your pH levels and blah blah blah what are your thoughts about that as a dermatologist it's the kind of product that derms recommend because it's been well studied to not really irritate skin types like rosacea or even if you are post laser it's actually very very gentle for those type like even after resurfacing procedures so we think it's gentle we don't think it really is a treatment cleanser some cleansers are a little bit pack a little more punch I said what do you think about that whole thing when people say like the pH level of a cleanser I think you're disrupting your finish no matter what when you're washing your face I've said this so I'm a big believer in that like you can splash water on your face and mess up your pH so I think you're gonna disrupt pH to a certain degree and hopefully the idea of a good skincare regimen is that you replenishing it back sometimes not every single day I use this via a baking powder it's part of filling that contains citric acid in it she's using a B or a baking soda cleansing scrub which there are like three words in that whole thing that I like freak me out without even without I'm just judging it from the title the name of the product baking soda swirl mix me up there they're strong they're strong they're strong the citric acid like she said the frequence and menthol menthol peppermint oil all of those like refreshing ingredients I feel like trick people into thinking that they're clean because it feels like at least a milky effect they're huge irritants and actually dehydrators of the skin yeah I'm super against them even on the body you'll often find them in like bug bite medications and stuff and that's just like a mental trick it actually it's not doing anything so I'm actually against it sort of in general as an ingredient yeah I really don't like this product for her personally yeah I don't know if I like it for anybody to be honest if somebody told me they were using this I'd probably be like what do you think of baking soda people ask me about baking soda all the time I think she likes it cuz when you mix baking soda with water it makes this a kind of like milky today's fizzy thing and it actually does pull out oils so I think if you believe you have a le skin which most people with acne like bumps now in this case I think we have to be a little bit careful but in with acne like bumps they I think what my guest says she says she doesn't use darl time I guess is she use it when she's feeling more oily right or when she's breaking out and it feels like she's doing something there's almost a mask like vibe to it isn't it I guess do you think it's bad for the skin though I think it's a scrub which I'm not a big fan of physical exfoliants especially on rosacea skin so this is compromised skin in general rosacea has chronic inflammation and their micro breaks in the skin and they just don't have a healthy skin barrier so it makes it even harder for them to tolerate things that normal skin people would yeah and so I think this was particularly harsh for her and is probably worsening some degree of this like irritation and chronic information that she has in making her breakout worse all right so let's see her next product I'm using this linear skin toner for combination to oily skin so she's using Laneige essential powder skin toner I'm looking at the ingredients I think she thinks she has extremely oily skin I in looking at you know the baking soda product prior to this I think coz of at the acne and inflammatory bumps she believes she has to fall within that 16 year old really oily skin teenage boy skin type and I don't think it is like I said I think you and I think Anna your routine is complex and your I think it's difficult to know but I think if inflammation without deep-rooted oiliness and I think these products are making you temporarily feel a little bit cleaned astringent out yeah I doubt she's fresh I mean that's what what I find when I'm talking to people like her is they're trying to literally dry out yeah those pimples but what you're saying is she's dealing with something that's not just a pimple my name's not dealing with pimples she's dealing with inflammation yeah and the chronic drying out is making it more red more inflamed and if she feels like she might be oily she might be causing the oiliness right cuz your oil glands are now overreacting to her stripping so it's like oh my god I need to make more oil it's a little bit of a horrible cycle like I feel badly like I think this product I'm just concerned about the alcohol content in it it's pretty high up on the ingredient list yeah and there's some fragrances and things like that in there - couple humectants but I don't see anything that jumps out is really anti-inflammatory which I'd love to see her on yeah I have to Sara's the one day that I usually use is this niacinamide and sink set on by the ordinary or when I'm feeling that my skin is a little bit dry I used this moods and power essence by Couric's she just answered exactly what we were saying so she's using that nice in my eye I think that's great for her right I agree because if it controls sort of pore size and whether rosacea act me they tend to be dominant especially central facially with a little bit of prominent pore size such a texture like you've said before nice and early products are easily incorporated into any skincare regimen because it's good for almost any skin type yeah and I even like the zinc here zinc is anti-inflammatory properties yeah whoo something that's anti-inflammatory in her so she said when I'm feeling dry she'll use the cause our exes snail mucin so I think it's exactly what you're saying she starts to strip her skin but then she starts to get that tight feeling so then she's like oh I need to replenish it so I'm gonna put on that snail mucin and even though it says it's an essence it's really sticky not that one specific yeah it's very very sticky so it's that humectant that's sticky yeah it's cuz it's giving her a little bit of that sort of moisture absorbing vive AK after she stripped it away but you can see how counterproductive that is like you are washing your face with really good cleansers like we were happy with it and then you are stripping all oils and then trying to kind of put it back it's almost like Oh waste of time like let's just find things that are a little bit more gentle on your skin and nor do I think I think part of this dripping thing is it'll improve or dry out the acne I think that's a little bit of time like it's counterintuitive I don't think you can dry out this type of acne at all right but if anything your skin we're ready yeah you're getting more redness just underlying an irritation moisturizer I use this la Ruche by the delorean sensitive fluid and I put this Mario Badescu buffering lotion on my breakouts after that I love that LaRoche particular me too I'm a huge fan of tellurian fluid it's really a gentle lightweight moisturizer works with almost any skin type I take it in all of my travel like my whenever I'm traveling yeah I take that moisturizer with me because I feel like if I don't know why it's like when you go into a different climate and stuff you're like not sure how your skin's gonna react yeah and I know I can always use on my stress right cuz it's not too heavy or too light it's kind of like it will adapt yourself and if I'm like getting irritated or I got like some kind of a sunburn even though I should be using my SPF and all that kinda stuff like if anything's happened to my skin like maybe I was like sleeping on some you know sheets at a hotel had something that made my skin react so that I always know I can use that moisturizer what I think is so interesting is that the tellurian line is made for sensitive skin she saw it on the you you saw it on the bottle when she showed it so here she is telling herself that she's only skin in certain products and now as she gets to the moisturizer she's like I feel I think she's noticing her skin is irritated and in my lap by that point exactly so she has what I mean I would venture to say so confused skincare regimen like she's like in my oily in my sensitive because they typically don't come together that often yeah so it I think that there's a little confusion here yeah but that particular product is great the LaRoche brand in general is pretty gentle yeah sensitive skins especially that tellurian line yes right yeah I think that that was a really good one and then she goes into that Mario Badescu buffering lotion which is the first thing is it's it's an alcohol yeah a drying alcohol right I would say that one is and then it's got zinc oxide he's nice in my glycerin interesting I actually didn't expect to be that I thought I was gonna end up being like kind of like their spot treatment but it's a little bit different what do you think of this product I actually don't know what I think of this product I'm not sure of it it seems like a gentler version of their their spot treatment which is a really well known product I I don't know I I think is she saying she uses a spot treatment or over she's a spot where she's breaking out yeah um I don't like the alcohol on her skin again it's about that skin barrier that's like totally compromised that's why she's so much erythema or redness so I'm not a big fan just because of the alcohol component I I think she might do better in this case this is what I think it's worth seeing a dermatologist because I think she may need a prescription strength product that balances those things to treat the actual inflamed bumps versus an over-the-counter spot treatment which are more effective for just drying it out yeah in the morning I start with the same cleanser by Cetaphil and fold with the same toner of nylon mesh then I'll use this so like as serum by the ordinary so we already know so she's using instead of felt totally fine yeah yep happy with that she uses that Bush lady morning yeah she's that little an age where we're just kind of like why alcohol yeah on the skin not necessary but she probably wants that second step to feel totally cleaned but especially in the morning is definitely don't need that you don't make that much oil in an average environment overnight cuz you're sleeping yeah and then she's gonna go into that 2% salicylic acid it's kind of like a serum from the ordinary what do you think of that for her skin type I think cell acid is a little bit harsh for someone with as much underlying redness yeah as her my guess is there's gonna be she she's making little micro tears and I'm shocked that she's not more irritated or complaining of stinging with this kind of routine but over time my guess is that's gonna happen got it she might have just like 21 year old resilient skin right now yeah but I think it's going to get less resilient over time with this barrage of drawing ingredients again salicylic acid great for classic acne yeah a little bit less good for something so inflamed yeah I think the salicylic acid it does it also go back to she thinks that she's an oily skin she thinks that she's got a little acne acne absolutely I think that this is just somebody who's struggling to identify her own skin type she sees pimples she thinks oily she thinks salicylic acid it does seem really frankly logical but I just think it's a little trickier you know got it and then I fall which with one of these moisturizers this one is a gel by 7ed for oily and problematic skin it contains hyaluronic acid and aloe vera and this is a vinta Larenz emulsion for sensitive skin there's right confused again where am i sensitive and my oily yeah like you usual acne patient cannot tolerate and I really like that of n I do till Erin product but they can't tolerate that that would be too heavy for an average oily skin acne person right I think she's actually you wouldn't look at that that yeah oh she is using that stuff so I think she's again replenishing stuff she's stripping away I think she does identify we the fact that she's sensitive yeah and a little irritable and that but Dutch but she's also torn between that and her because she's got that saber med where she's like and it's a gel it's a gel moisturizer so she's some days she's like I'm really oily I'm gonna just use a gel moisturizer right she's not a true moisturizer and in a couple days she's totally dried out and needs this to calm everything down because she's so irritated not just drive but irritated is my guess yeah and then so this is her morning which leads me to believe also she doesn't want to have like flakiness or something if she is gonna wear any makeup no good points yeah so how much she's going with the thicker moisturizer as well for my SPF I'm using this essence Sun milk SPF 50 by Misha and for an eye cream I have this therapy eye cream thank you very much for watching she's so adorbs I love that Misha SPF Nimue feels very light it's very Nobles like nothing on the shine so lightweight yeah and it's a great SPF with both UVA and UVB coverage I'm totally happy with that oh yeah say and this Arabi eye cream morning I think totally fine for her too right yeah absolutely it's a little preventative it's a really gentle wrong with ceramides which will replenish some of that skin barrier that we keep talking about with her so I think that's a good product to for her so you know I I think I'm gonna defer to the professional about her morning and nighttime skincare routine she's got a really really tough one yeah and it's more when I say tough it's more that I feel for you Anna because I feel like this is one where you're gonna have to do a lot of trial and error yeah yeah and I think that maybe seeing a professional or dermatologist to sort of treat the underlying inflammation will be really helpful here in general I feel like you already identified yourself of having two very different skin types sensitive and oily those are the two things you tend to like lean towards and they're actually on opposite spectrums almost of each other so something is not jiving and it sounds to me like it might be more of this acne rosacea type of saying so I think less is more on her less stripping products gentle cleansers like Cetaphil gentle moisturizers no alcohol based products be good to your skin barrier which means maybe investing in a better like a pH balancing essence if you want that step but I think the moisturizers that you're choosing which is the LaRoche in the event are both actually really good for your type of skin so she's choosing the right moisturizer yeah but I think what's thing here is a treatment product and I think that's because you don't really have a true diagnosis yet and I think maybe this is the time where you know not just because I'm a dermatologist but I think someone could really help you if they saw it in person or able to ask a few more questions or like you said it might just take a little bit of trial and error to find that balance yeah between a little bit of over-reactive skin and also treating the acne at the same time yeah you know this is so when I get messages from people all the time that are dealing with stuff that Anna's dealing with that are dealing with stuff that you know just completely other things but what I tend to find in this situation is that they'll tell me they went to a dermatologist once like she did maybe a year ago and then they tried something it didn't work for them and then they just kind of moved on from it yeah what do you think of that kind of the situation because then they'll be like I don't know if I trust dermatologists I saw a dermatologist they said this to me that was stupid what do you think about that it's hard I always try to tell everyone that when the FDA actually approves a medication as being that Sue's acne as the example is being effective for acne they're looking for 50 percent 5-0 improvement at month 3 that's really slow and really not that improved half better at month 3 most of us are not happy with that I'm not happy with other patients are happy with it but you have to realize what's realistic and you have to keep continuing to follow up so you know my approach or someone like this is a little bit of closer follow-up at the beginning you almost need a cheerleader to be like you know that's what it's not gonna go away overnight let's get through this you've had it for a couple years I'm not gonna cure your acne in two weeks if you had it for two years that's kind of get together and figure out what works best for you so I think patience is really a virtue here when it comes to skin care nothing women which is you know none of us have yeah but it's the truth if you vibe really well with your dermatologist then continue to see them and let them know what you're frustrated by maybe it's not working fast enough for you maybe you don't like the way the products feel maybe you don't feel heard whatever it is if you don't vibe with them you know everyone is a different type of personality then go seek a second opinion but I think the important thing is to not give up on seeking help with a dermatologist because there are prescription products that I think would really be beneficial and probably make the rest of her skincare regiment simpler I think you just can't achieve what she might want to over the counter Potter right like the only products I think I would keep for her are the cleansing balm Clinique to remove her makeup at night Cetaphil and probably that la roche-posay tellurian yeah oh and the niacinamide from the ordinary and then the venn product is my dad and I think that's too rich for someone who struggles with feeling like she's maybe a little oily don't because I think that they could really help improve her skin barrier yeah but like maybe the problem is she's just got too much stripping happening and so she might see a big difference if she's not stripping her skin exactly when you first cut out products know that you may have a flair so that's something that I think is really hard for people to deal with so she may blame it on cutting out the products but the truth is changing anything immediately can make you flare so if you're gonna cut out products give it a little bit of time like 3-4 weeks see if the skin can calm down and then sort of go from there in terms of adding new products I think having what I call products schizophrenia like jumping back and forth to ten products here is actually the worst thing you can do yeah especially for her skin type where she gets inflammation and irritation easily so easily yeah yeah but you're right once she gets her inflammation irritation under control that moisturizes the event one might become a little bit too much for her but until she gets there I think she needs it to kind of bring back the moist jobs good to know that's really really good to know is there anything besides going to a dermatologist that she could probably add right now for now I think you can look for cleansers or acne products that are sulfa based I think those things can decrease inflammation and redness pretty quickly and you may find they're less stripping versions that have anti-inflammatory effects versus just drying something out that makes sense alright well awesome thank you so much for being here this one was really like for me especially was very educational because this is something that I really do think an expert has to look at and like you said you know you need somebody probably in person to look at you and that's where this can get a little bit difficult but I feel like I feel like there was a lot to take away from it too yeah I think the big thing here is not all acne is the same that you can have acne on sensitive skin and not all acne is on oily skin so don't always just assume that I think there's inflammation of a different type fear that's get you better but I think that you know the good news is there's no scarring or anything whose thing like that so as long as you get the inflammation on control I'm sure you'll be on a good path I love it thank you so much dr. chu and then you guys if you want to send in your skincare regimen there's information below in the description box you can find us on Facebook and our private Facebook group and you know just have some questions if you want cuz we'll answer I'll talk to you soon take care [Music]",

        "transcript": "- It's literally been forever\nsince I've done a video. Hi guys, I'm Ross. Thank you, Adore, for having me. My video's for anyone that has rosacea, redness in the skin, high coloring, problematic skin, sensitive\nskin, you name it. If your skin feels it when you put some skincare on, and it starts tingling, it doesn't work, it's not working for you, I'm just gonna show you a\nroutine that works for me, AM and PM. When you have rosacea, or you have a skin condition that just is so sensitive, sometimes you're totally\nfine for six months, can be totally fine for a year and out of nowhere your\nskin just tells you that it's no longer good, no longer good for you. The first step is to make\nsure you use a cleanser. The cleanser I'm using at the moment is a Dermalogica cleanser, which is the soothing\nand calming cleanser, which I'm gonna grab. Just dampening my face. (water splashing) I just damped my face, damped my face, wetted my face, my face is wet. I'm using the UltraCalming cleanser. I did watch James the other day, James Vivian said that\nyou do have to cleanse for two minutes. I don't know if I've got\ntwo minutes to do this, I don't know if I spend\ntwo minutes cleansing, but this cleanser is\nbeautiful on the skin, it feels gorgeous on the face, it doesn't make my skin react, and it doesn't make it tight afterwards. Sometimes when you've got rosacea, or you've got sensitive\nskin you can use it then afterwards your\nskin goes really tight, and you get loads of lovely flaky bits. I'm not sure that was two\nminutes, sorry James, babe. That's what I've got in me to do that, right, I'm going to the sink. The big reveal, all bare, you can actually see my rosacea, so really red nose. Always in the summer, everybody's like \"Oh, you've\ngot a bit of sun there.\" And I'm like, \"No, that's just my nose.\" But, it's like a map of England, so usually it comes up here, down here, in here, and then I get, you can\nsee all the redness here, I get the dry, flakiness all in here. Done a podcast with the girls in Beauty iQ how I try to cover up my\nrosacea using foundation. But usually my boyfriend\ncalls me a lamington, Australian lamington because\nI get all the flaky bits start coming here. But this skincare routine\nis working for me right now. So, once I've cleansed, I'm going to use a serum. The one I'm using in the AM at the moment is the Osmosis one, it's quite boujee, but it's working. This is the Rescue serum, I'm using a pump and a half of that. This feels lovely, and this is just gonna repair the skin. Smells quite earthy, it's there to calm the\nskin and soothe the skin, that's what I need when I'm going to work, I don't need anything on\nthere that's aggravating it. But you can see there just, yeah, I'm happy, and you can instantly see hydrating, and crows feet don't look as dry but nice, nice and plump. Then, for my everyday,\nLa Roche-Posay Toleriane is a really gorgeous, everyday moisturizer which is just great for anyone that has super sensitive skin. If you're me, I will literally\njust use this moisturizer, and then I'll just probably go straight on with an SPF, and then I'll whack on my foundation. Make sure you put a tiny\nbit of moisturizer on, and then you get your SPF. I don't use a primer, I'm\nvery naughty like that. So, I go on with an anthelios, or an ultra-violet, get that SPF 50. Actually looks all right, not bad with no foundation on actually. Okay, so I've cleansed, and now I'm gonna share with you my night routine. My night routine is, it's not even that complicated. I think my whole makeup, beauty routine is never complicated, I literally use two foundations\nand that's about it. For my night routine, I'm gonna use a SkinCeuticals, which is phyto green corrective gel. You take one to two drops of this, maybe I take three, and this is great 'cause\nlike anti-inflammatory, antiseptic it said as well, and this is great, you put it on your areas that really aggravate you, and for me it's always\nthe center of my face. I have got it checked out, and I've been told to drink ginger tea and licorice tea, and I'm sure all of us out there that we've tried all sorts of things to kind of calm our rosacea, but nothing really works. So that, I put on the SkinCeuticals and you can use that down your neck, you can use it on your hand, you can use it anywhere, anywhere you feel that you're\nhaving a flare up is great. So I don't know if you have it, but you do a bit of\nthis throughout the day, 'cause you know that your skin's nipping, or it's itching, or I tend to do a lot of this, because I don't want\nmy foundation to move, or pressing, then when I get in from\nwork that's the first thing, that I take my makeup off, whack that on, and hopefully it will calm it down. Then I go on with a moisturizer. I don't even know how\nto pronounce that name, mesoestetic, (mumbling), can you see it? And basically, this is gorgeous, smells a bit like tonka bean, like freshly baked cakes. It's there to renew your skin, and provide strength to your cells. It's actually gorgeous, it's really gorgeous, smells beautiful. There is a special technology within this, really good for any of\nus that have rosacea, and I would literally just\nput this on before bed, I think it looks lovely. And considering I've\ngot a nice, rosy face, it doesn't nip, doesn't tingle, we're always gonna live with rosacea, or sensitive skin, I suppose it's just using skincare that works for you, and rosacea flares up\nif you have spicy food, if you've been out in the sun, if you haven't had enough sleep, if you're stressed out, it really just does come alive. Even when you're thinking something, and you might get a bit anxious, sometimes my rosacea starts nipping, and starts kind of coming out. There's like five key products that I use, this is working perfect\nfor my skin right now. So, guys, if you like this video, please hit subscribe, like, ring the bell. Thank you so much, Adore, for having me, all my love to anybody out there that has rosacea, sensitive\nskin, problematic skin, you name it, skin that screams when you put certain skincare on it, this is my happy recipe for you. All right then, thank you\nso much for watching, guys, (kissing) take care, bye. (upbeat music)",
