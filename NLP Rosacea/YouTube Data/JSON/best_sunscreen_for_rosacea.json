        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "hi everyone welcome back to the channel today's video is going to be very quick and easy just to update the list of sunscreens that don't break you out in 2023 my name is Lydia I'm a beauty industry Insider and a rosacea suffer so I have super sensitive skin and I know that sunscreen is really something that um triggers a lot of people with sensitive skins because it can cause your skin to break out so every year what I do is update the list of sunscreens that don't break my skin out obviously this is totally personal you're still required to do a patch test because what works for me is not necessarily working for you too but I'm going to give you my opinion on the sunscreens that really didn't break my skin out and so I estimate being good for sensitive skins sun protection helps you in so many ways helps you strengthen your Skin Barrier which in sensitive skins is already compromised it helps you protecting your skin from the danger of skin cancer and it also is your best ally to age gracefully I wouldn't call it an anti-age product but it's definitely the most effective pro-age product but it comes with the price of breaking your skin out the skin on your face is not the same as the skin on your body so definitely there is going to be something that is too potent for your face even so even if you use a sunscreen that is directly targeted at your face skin you're going to have to pay attention to what you're putting on your face a little bit um this is not fear mongering uh I'm just going to put a disclaimer right there is just about some ingredients in Sun care they sensitize your skin a little bit more normally you have two options chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens in my experience and I repeat in my own experience the ones that are more tolerated by um sensitive Skins are mineral sunscreens however they come with the price of being the ones that really tend to leave a white cast but I understand that they're not always suitable for every skin tone because most of the times they're not even suitable for mine and I have a light olive one for my recommendations the Evergreen andos from La Rush Paz is a great one it comes in a very handy package that you can even put in your jeans pocket it's completely transparent that exists uh in a normal version and in a matte version this has never broken my skin out has no color so it's suitable for everyone another product I would really recommend to try is new type of chemical sunscreen sprr sine AR SPF 50 plus this is a new generation of chemical sunscreen that use the ingredient that tended to break skins out in the past it's definitely rosacea friendly from aen it's called K so maybe it's been translated as perfum cream free or fragrance-free cream SPF 50 plus again if you have rosacea you can also try this one which is my favorite it's the rosacea treatment Clinic desensitizing barrier fluid SPF 50 this has the most wonderful elegant formula as a sunscreen it gives your skin such a youthful glow and it doesn't break your skin out it can tend to leave a little bit of a white cast at least initially on um some skin if you want to know more about it you can check out this video right here where I reviewed the whole the rosacea Clinic the rosacea treatment Clinic line as for mineral sunscreens my favorite this year as well is the Polish Choice essential glow moisturizer this is an SPF of 30 but nevertheless it's a wonderful wonderful cream that has a whipped cream texture it feels amazing on the skin it's really h hydrating it has this cute blurring effect that hides a little bit of your redness and also a little bit of your texture and it's overall what I would recommend for any day recently I've also tried this skin restoring moisturizer with SPF 50 from Polish Choice this one is from normal and dry skin and it's from the resist line and it's said to be um a silky cream that hydrates skin and evens the skin tone and helps prevent UV damage and signs of aging it's rich in anti antioxidants but as far as the even skin tone is concerned I am not really sure about this maybe on skins are not rosacea that have no rosacea so they have no redness to really even out but I would totally recommend it for people who don't want wear makeup because it's completely undetectable all right you guys I told you it was quick and easy um I hope this video was helpful to you if you did give it a thumbs up if you want to see more suggestions for sunscreen that don't break your skin out check out this video right here if you want to know more about the rosacea check out this other video right here and of course subscribe to the channel until next time bye",

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare

        "transcript": "hey I'm going to share with you today what sunscreens I recommend for rosacea skin of course this is a process of you to experiment on what what sunscreens work for you but I'm going to give you a place to start because it's a question I am asked all too often understandably because people with rosacea skin we need more protection now I'm not wearing any makeup I could probably make my skin really red right now um yeah see I have a you know I'm prone to being a little bit pink but as you can see I've got no breakouts anymore I don't flush red but yeah I can assault my skin because I'm super white and get a bit pink but it will go down really quickly okay so I'm going to give you two recommendations for the face and two recommendations for your body so the first one for your face would be this one here you can see that clearly links will be in the description just for your convenience this is not sponsored so this one is sunn skin.com and this one's a zinc sunscreen non-toxic and look most zinc sunscreens that I've tried I've been really against because they're usually super thick and they leave like this white layer they don't allow you to really um R like it doesn't really rub in very easily you end up having like these white bits on your skin it looks really really bad and especially if you have darker skin as well um it just doesn't look right and then if you have white skin you end up looking like a ghost so with this one it is not as thick not as nasty you don't need very much so it actually lasts quite a long time which I like even though it's such a small bottle believe it or not this isn't the smallest size it comes in uh so this actually last quite a while so I like that Pro tip mix it in with your sunscreen mix it in with an oil and rub it in and you'll get really good coverage with not very much sunscreen so love that about this one my second recommendation is osmosis protect now I have a LoveHate relationship with this sunscreen uh the reason why I hate it is the reason why I love it um is actually because I love it I should say uh it is the best that I've ever tried and I don't want it to be the best cuz it's a little bit more pricey and it runs out really quickly so I can't use it dayto day because it runs out really quickly I wish there was a better one the reason why I like this one one is because it is a zinc base but it's not the only ingredient this one is 100% zinc what will I say about this this just feels like moisturizer to me this just feels beautiful on the skin it has a really lovely smell there's nothing about it that feels like sunscreen that's why it's awesome but in priority of products for my skin sunscreen is not as much the priority in terms of budget which is why I don't use it all the time I still use it because I love it but I tend to use it more sparingly so if I'm going out somewhere ice or going out for the day like a brunch or something and I'm going to use makeup which I don't often ever wear if I do wear makeup I use this because I don't like the feeling of layering on my skin and this feels like a moisturizer it doesn't feel like I'm layering give it a go it's beautiful okay now body all right um Eco Sonia they're a gorgeous brand gorgeous Australian brand uh well it says product of Australia New Zealand and they have a number of beautiful like facial oils and other products that are incredible that I use dayto day every single day this s SPF sunscreen was recommended to me by my corneo therapist she about it I know so many other people who love this sunscreen so I really thought it was a shoe in I gave it a go I took it to Europe with me thinking it was going to be amazing for me I personally didn't love it there are benefits to it it rubs in really well it's 3 hours water resistant um it's good for the environment all these things if you care about those things they're really great I recommend trying it because so many people love it for me personally don't know whether it's because of my fair skin it just feels like there's a coating on me it feels claustrophobic when I feel like there's a coating on me maybe it's just having a rosaceous skin and a really severe skin condition for 7 plus years that I'm like I just get a bit like I don't like things feeling like something's on my skin or sitting on the surface of my skin even though it doesn't leave white residues it does rub in from a aesthetic point of you but feeling wise it feels like it's on the surface for me other people love it which is why I wanted to share it with you give it a go give it a try it might really work for you and it's non-toxic okay so the one that I love and it might be controversial actually there are benefits drawbacks to this sunscreen so I really love this parasol oil and this one's 30 plus in a Australia this is an expensive product uh it's a European product it's a French pot product it's not something that I can buy in the store here in Australia so I have to order it online I tried this when I was in Europe and it was a game changer for me to not feel like I had any sunscreen on my skin but I'm still protected it can help with a little bit of Browning still get some uh vitamin D which is really important without damaging the skin still protecting the skin I do have to apply this more often than I would something like this but I don't care I'm happy to apply a little bit more to feel like I just have moisturizer on this my skin it does um keep my skin really moist it doesn't smell like sunscreen it doesn't feel like sunscreen it rubs in really easily honestly I love it I really love it um in Europe there's no downside to this oil you can it's very cheap in Europe uh and you can get the 60 plus so you don't have to apply quite so often um so when I go back to Europe I'm going to stock up on this oil sunscreen so that's my recommendations for sunscreen if you have rosacea skin if you have sunscreens that you love or that you recommend for people to try that have worked for you please leave them in the comments below because we need all the help we can get you know you've got to try these things you've got to try all different products for your skin even with moisturizers it's taken me I guess it depends on the starting point but when I look at when I started experimenting with different oils and realizing you know my barriers improving what oils work for me now that my barrier is really great what moisturizers work for me um it was a trial and error phase so I used to use creams uh then I used thinner creams like thick creams thin creams and then oils and I found that a thinner cream with an oil works really well for my skin so it's really just a trial and error Pro process uh to see what works for you so please if you have any recommendations leave them below and I'm going to leave the links to the ones that I've shared in the description",

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as

        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

        "transcript": "with so many sunscreens out there how the heck are you supposed to choose one hey guys welcome back to the video today I'm going to be giving you some practical tips on how to choose the best sunscreen for your skin there are a few different types of sunscreens organic sunscreens commonly referred to as chemical sunscreens these contain compounds in them with carbon and the bonds between the carbons in these compounds are what helps the ingredients absorb UVA protecting the skin you also have inorganic sunscreens AKA mineral sunscreens these don't contain carbon compounds but rather sheets of metal oxides zinc oxide or titanium dioxide they work by primarily absorbing UV rays although to a small extent they also reflect them then you have a category known as hybrid sunscreens which are kind of in between and organic and inorganic sunscreen and that they have inorganic actives like zinc oxide and metal oxide and they have organic actives like octinoxate for example regardless of which one of these three types of sunscreens you want to go with they all can adequately effectively safely protect your skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation but people's skin is different in terms of how it responds to ultraviolet radiation from the sun when considering a sunscreen one thing you want to factor in is what your Fitzpatrick photo type is what is the Fitzpatrick phototype you might ask it is a way to classify People based on how their skin responds to the Sun goes from one to six Fitzpatrick phototype 1 easily burn they never tan phototype 2 Burns easily but sometimes can tan Prototype 3 is right in the middle they sometimes burn but they actually tan easily phototype 4 rarely Burns and tans quite easily five typically are people who have moderately pigmented skin they rarely ever burn but they tan quite easily phototype 6 has very deeply pigmented skin rarely burn they tan very very quickly and very intensely compared to people who have a paler skin type people who have a deeper skin type phototypes five and six they have more of the pigment melanin in the upper epidermis and that's what helps absorb some UVB the sun emits a few different things that can impact our skin negatively in our skin Health regardless of our skin tone UVB are the Rays that penetrate to the epidermis and damage the DNA in our skin cells MVP is largely what is responsible for a sunburn and people with a deeper skin tone because they have more melanin they have a little bit of natural protection against that UVB UVA on the other hand is another thing that comes from the sun to damage our skin it penetrates much much more deeply in comparison to UVB and it affects all skin tones being a deeply pigmented person does not protect you from UVA it only offers some protection against UVB UVA actually destroys the supportive framework of the deeper layers of the skin it destroys collagen then you have visible light that comes from the sun that's what we see with our eyes that illuminates the world and certain wavelengths of visible light namely in the blue light spectrum actually can drive hyperpigmentation in people who have Fitzpatrick phototypes three and higher it's a UVB rays from the Sun they damage DNA in our epidermis in people who have a deeper skin tone though what you will see is that that DNA damage is primarily restricted to the upper layers of the epidermis in contrast people with a paler skin type the UVB rays will reach the bottom of their epidermis and damage that basal layer of the epidermis and if you'll recall back to my video all about how skin works in the epidermis you have these layers of keratinocytes that vary in terms of how mature they are at the top you have the most mature keratinocytes and they're at the basal layer you have very immature keratinocytes along with stem cells so in people with paler skin the UVB rays make their way to that layer and cause DNA damage there in a very vulnerable population of cells people who have a deeper skin tone they're actually better at repairing the DNA damage from UVB in comparison to people where they pal our skin type these differences explain why people with a paler skin type are more at risk for skin cancers related to sun exposure people who have a deeper skin tone yes they do make skin cancers but the majority of them are not related to sun exposure the differences in how skin reacts to UVB also explains why people with a paler skin type are vulnerable to sunburn which is largely mediated by UVB moving over though to UVA the Rays that penetrate really deeply UVA contributes to premature photo aging sun damage and a lot of people hear that and they assume oh that's just a cosmetic thing it doesn't matter but it does matter because premature aging of your skin is going to impact the health of your skin long term the longer you live and nowadays people are living very long lives you really want to keep your skin as an organ system as healthy as possible because it has a lot of responsibilities for keeping you healthy all skin tones can benefit from wearing sunscreen while deeper skin tones are more protected from UVB they're actually vulnerable to UVA as well as visible light visible light again is light wasty with our eyes and primarily it's the blue light blue light and UVA are major drivers of hyperpigmentation in people who have deeper skin tone the two together exhibit what's called Synergy meaning they work together to make hyperpigmentation really really stubborn for people who have a deeper skin tone so you can see how based on your skin tone your skin type your Fitzpatrick photo type you're likely going to have some different goals when it comes to what you are looking to get out of a sunscreen for people who are pale it's going to be protect you from burning to protect you from skin cancer and to protect from premature skin aging whereas if you are a deeper skin tone sunscreen is going to be there to protect you from premature skin aging as well as to protect against sun-induced hyperpigmentation regardless of your skin tone if you have a pre-existing skin condition like acne eczema rosacea Sun can drive those conditions making sunscreen very important to helping keep those conditions under control and from getting worse do people with a paler skin type need to look for sunscreens that offer visible light protection as it stands now it's unclear if it impacts people who have a paler skin type like it does people with a medium skin type so if you're somebody who's very very pale Burns easily does not tan looking for sunscreens that have visible light protection in them may not necessarily be what you need whereas if you have a deeper skin tone you're going to want to look for those in ingredients that can protect against that visible light so we've gone over the different types of sunscreen and we've gone over the different photo types and kind of how their needs differ so what are you going to look for then when it comes to choosing a sunscreen some of this is actually going to vary to not to further confuse you but some of this will vary quite a bit actually depending on where you live so in the U.S we don't have as many active sunscreen ingredients as they do in other countries so when we're looking at sunscreens we've gone over the different types organic inorganic hybrid but then you have these different metrics right on the sunscreen namely SPF what does that tell you that actually is giving you a snapshot as to how good that particular sunscreen is going to be for protecting you against a sunburn which again is largely mediated by UVB but depending on your skin type that may or may not be the most important thing the general recommendation for everyone is to use at least SPF 30 but truthfully if you have a very pale skin type and you're going to be spending time Outdoors you're going to be much better served by a higher SPF whereas if you're somebody who has a deep skin tone you rarely rarely burn SPF 30 should be more than adequate for you because that is that's a reflection of the UVB protection it's not a reflection of the UVA protection per se now if you have a deeper skin tone paying attention to the UVA protection is really where what you're going to want to care about so how do you know how good a sunscreen is at protecting you against UVA that's going to depend on where you live and where you're buying your sunscreens because in contrast to SPF which is a measurement that is very standardized and pretty much the same all over the world in contrast to SPF which is reflective of UVB there's a lot of variation from country to country in terms of how UVA is is measured many countries use something called the um PA rating which is a a rating system of UVA protection so if you have a deeper skin tone you're going to want to choose a higher UVA rating um it's done based on something called persistent pigment darkening or in Europe they do a test in a lab to figure it out but you're going to want the higher UVA protection if you have a deeper skin tone especially because that's going to help you out with dealing with hyperpigmentation preventing it and clearing it that's not to say that if you have a paler skin type you would not be well served to choose a higher UVA rating as well unfortunately here in the US we don't sunscreen manufacturers are not required to give a PA rating of a you know determine UVA protection they're required to show that it protects against UVA but they're not required to provide a metric as to kind of what extent so it's basically on a pass scale basis so to make sure that your sunscreen offers you good UVA protection and if you're buying it here in the US you want to look for the terms broad spectrum because that ensures that the sunscreen will protect you from UVA if you're buying sunscreen here in the US everyone should be choosing sunscreens that say broad spectrum and the majority of them do where you'll find products that are not broad spectrum is a lot of times makeup with SPF is not broad spectrum it has sunscreen active ingredients that primarily protect against UVB but don't offer UVA and all skin tones they need the UVA protection now I said that the SPF generally like in general just like a general recommendation to all people is you know at least SPF 30. where you live in the Time of the Year may also be influential in terms of what sunscreen you choose if you live somewhere at a very high latitude and it's winter you can make do with SPF 15. these tips that I'm giving you they come from International an international uh consensus panel recommendation so I'll put my reference Down Below in the description box then there comes the issue of visible light protection that is going to be most important for people who have Fitzpatrick photo type 3 and higher the main visible light that that impacts the skin is blue light and it's a blue light that comes from the Sun that you need to concern yourself with not the blue light that comes from your devices if you are Fitzpatrick one and two the visible light as it stands now it doesn't appear as though it's an issue for those paler skin types but for people who have deeper skin tones and you're wanting to prevent clear hyperpigmentation or you have a skin condition with hyperpigmentation like melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation the visible light and UVA protection are like the most important pieces so we've already talked about what to look for for UVA protection broad spectrum or look at the PA rating what do you look for for visible light this is an area where unfortunately sunscreens don't have any standardized tests to show or prove that their product offers visible light the best you can do as a consumer in selecting a sunscreen that could offer you visible light protection is to choose sunscreens that have certain ingredients that are known to protect against visible light namely iron oxides which are what give a sunscreen tint so a tinted sunscreen will have iron oxides in it just make sure read the ingredients and the tint can offer protection against visible light which drives hyperpigmentation now if you live in Europe for example then developed a filter called trisorb which protects against visible light as well so again like I said a lot of what you may choose is going to come down to where you live you know for for people who have hyperpigmentation deeper skin tones hyperpigmentation that's that's what you're looking to protect from you don't burn but you want to clear and fade hyperpigmentation you have a lot more options at your disposal for very effective sunscreens outside of the US it's not to say that the American sunscreens cannot get you there the problem is with the American sunscreens you're not going to be able to walk into Walmart or Target or any store and look at the shelves and say this is going to be the best one for giving me the optimal UVA protection I need and the optimal visible light protection I need so those are the pointers with regards to sunscreens in terms of ingredients that protect against these different aspects of sun that impact people's skin differently based on your skin tone and how it reacts but there are some other things that you may want to consider when choosing a sunscreen first of all is like how sensitive your skin is because a lot of organic sunscreens they can burn and sting whereas mineral sunscreens typically don't do that and again it's kind of going to be influenced by where you live because in my experience trying sunscreens from all over the world organic sunscreens outside of the US are not as likely to burn in sting whereas here in the U.S it's a common issue that a lot of people run into with Organic sunscreens in which case you may want to choose an inorganic mineral sunscreen less likely or you may want to choose a hybrid a hybrid somewhere in between but they tend to not Sting the other thing you're going to want to factor in is the cast so in organic sunscreens with zing think when we're titanium dioxide they will leave a white cast some are better than the than others in terms of the extent of the white cast that they leave but for people who are phototypes five and six minerals sunscreens will leave a cast now they offer tinted mineral sunscreens which are a great option for deeper skin tones because they offer that visible light protection but even the tinted mineral sunscreens sometimes can often still leave a chalky cast and the paper that I'm talking to you guys about where I got you know the consensus recommendation from experts in photo protection all over the world Physicians from all over the world who are dermatologists experts in in photo protection like that's that's their niche in dermatology they basically said try and try and find a tinted sunscreen that color matches and I'm like how many how many tinted sunscreens did this panel actually try on themselves because if you've tried tinted sunscreens there aren't that many shades that that at least in my experience that I believe can be made so if you have a skin type like me many are orangey on the skin whereas if you have a deeper skin tone some of the tinted ones they kind of give this like lavender look some are better than the other others as far as the tint and how it looks on the skin but uh it's a lot of trial and error and that is that's frustrating that that's frustrating but it's something that it's something to think about you choose a tinted mineral sunscreen it may may not leave a white cast but it may you know it may be super noticeable on your skin the advantage of it is that it's got the iron oxides which can protect you from that visible light the disadvantage is the way it looks you may not want to wear it in which case it's not going to work as far as cast and looking weird on the skin the Organics on screens aka the chemical ones they they they typically don't leave any kind of cast uh you know they some of them they they may have a slight white effect a white Sheen but they're not going to leave like that white chalky cast a type of sunscreen that I find is a really good happy medium though I find that the hybrid sunscreens are a really good option for everyday use a lot of them are tinted another feature to factor in with a sunscreen is you're going to want to think about am I going to be outdoors doing sport am I going to be swimming do I live somewhere that's very tropical and humid and I'm sweating a lot in those situations it's going to behoove you to choose a water resistant sunscreen now there's no such thing as a waterproof sunscreen but a water resistant sunscreen is a little bit better at holding up under humidity moisture sweat and swimming so you want to look for water resistant then you have different forms of sunscreen right you have creams you have lotions you have gels you have sprays you have sticks and you have powders for Reliable sun protection you're going to want to stick with a cream a lotion or a gel because they provide the most reliable consistent layer of sun protection they're not vulnerable as vulnerable to skip areas creams and lotions you know they can feel greasy on the skin in which case you may want to choose a gel a lot of gels they're going to have low molecular weight alcohol in them which which can be a little drying you know it creates a nice fast absorbing formula that's not greasy but it also can be drying the La Roche Posay Melton sunscreen milk as a matter of fact YouTube has a shopping feature where you can tap on the little bag and the sunscreen should come up so that's a really good you know fast absorbing non-greasy one and it's water resistant people love sunscreen sprays but unfortunately sunscreen sprays have a lot of problems associated with them they're not off the table but they have problems associated with them namely like you actually have to spray it multiple times back and forth and then you physically have to rub it in a lot of people think sprays you know they like them because they think they they don't have to use their hands but you you actually do the reason you have to to use your hands is because they're not providing an adequate uh coverage just by spraying them on they need to physically be rubbed in I mean if you read the if you read the directions very carefully it should tell you to do that and then the other thing about spray phrases you don't want to spray them directly into your face a lot of people like them because they think they can use them that way but you really shouldn't because the safety of them being inhaled or you know getting into your eyes not that's not something that's established so it's the way to use a spray on your face is actually you need to spray it into your hands and then Pat it into your face which for people who have really oily and acne prone skin and they find that their Skin's very sensitive to a lot of sunscreens which can feel heavy or greasy that actually ends up working out well for them so long as you apply enough of the spray and get it on your face that may be your best option if you have if you're one of those who is often asking like every sunscreen breaks me out every sunscreen breaks me out you may try the spray approach just you have to use enough the sticks sunscreens they are a great option for around the eyes because there's no water and because there's no water it's you know as you're putting it on the skin it's not going to seep and run into your eyes a lot of people end up with blurry burning vision related to putting sunscreen around their eyes the mineral sunscreens are a good option here they tend to not do that water resistant formulas are less likely to do that but if you have a stick it's you know it shouldn't do that at all so I like sticks for around the eyes but you know the problem with the stick is you really really have to rub rub rub to get a good thick layer on there so they're not super reliable but they are handy to have on hand for touch-ups and particularly around the eyes powders I like to use an SPF powder if I have a sunscreen that's super shiny because it helps mattify it but I would never rely on a powder alone because a powder is not putting down a layer of sun protection it's just putting little spots here and there so you're going to have basically holes all over your skin where the UV rays are still getting in all right guys so there's a lot to it to think about when it comes to choosing a sunscreen if you've got a sunscreen that you like enough and you're wearing it you're winning uh you know you don't feel as though like you you have to optimize every single little thing and the other major take-home point about sunscreen is that you should never rely exclusively on sunscreen to protect your skin from the Sun regardless of your skin type or skin tone because you know it's it's not a shield of armor it has a lot of pitfalls and and reasons why it fails so you also want to do some other behaviors a hat Sun protective clothing sunglasses seek shade maybe carry an umbrella with you somebody pointed that out in a recent video to remind me and yes you are absolutely right at having an umbrella with you is a great way for added protection and don't stay out in the sun too long just because you have sunscreen on it doesn't mean that you you are able to stay out longer that's a common misconception because sunscreen will delay that painful experience of a burn but it's not necessarily A you know a shield of armor so you're getting a lot of UVA likely and damaging your skin so be really mindful of how much sun exposure you're getting and rain and all the behaviors all right y'all now on the end slate I'm going to have my video does sunscreen even work so if you missed that one check it out next it'll be on the end slate but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "well hey everybody welcome back to skincare with Chris Gibson if you're new I'm Chris I am your skincare expert I'm here to help you get your best skin ever and on this channel we talked about skin care products skin care routines skin care problems and today we're talking about rosacea and what products you can use to help combat that problem so if that's your thing please hit the subscribe button and the little notification bell so that you get notified when my new videos are up okay so finding skin care products actually will work when you have rosacea is a really tough go especially when you're talking about face washes and sunscreens anything that has chemical components because and I know you know this or you wouldn't have clicked on this video rosacea gives you a very sensitive skin most people think it's just redness but it's very very sensitive skin so it's my goal that by the end of this video you have some products that you can choose from and trust that will help you calm and reduce and soothe rosacea outbreaks or episodes all of the products I'm going to talk about today are in the video description box below and they are dermatologist approved and they can really really help now just like acne which I talked about on this channel incessantly I know since I have such a personal history with that rosacea is along with eczema and flama Torrey disease of the skin a lot of the same things that can trigger acne actually trigger rosacea and eczema so things like food things like skin care ingredients things like stress all can make these episodes and flare-ups happen so having the right skin care products and routine in place can really go a long way to keep flare-ups at bay and the really good news is that the products I'm going to talk about today they are so inexpensive okay first up at any routine of course is cleanser it's very very important that you use a cleanser that is not over drying and irritating Aveeno has an ultra calming face wash that's very good for rosacea it's a very mild formulation it's water based and it's infused with a botanical feverfew which has been shown to reduce redness and inflammation so it's a very calming face wash the other great thing is that it's fragrance free which is really really important when you have any kind of skin condition because fragrance can read really irritate your skin so this one is water-based fragrance free and will not strip your skin of the natural oil that it needs to be healthy it's also great at removing makeup for those of you who wear it so this makes an excellent choice for a cleanser for rosacea next up is moisturizer of course and moisturizer can really be a troublesome thing when you have rosacea because a lot of the common ingredients in skincare products are very irritating to this condition la roche-posay has a really wonderful moisturizers are called tolerate double repair face moisturizer it is also water and glycerin based it also has niacinamide which is really good for reducing inflammation and redness it also has ceramides which help your skin rebuild its actual structure and help it hold in moisture now if you're someone who has a lot of redness with your rosacea you really going to love this next product a Veen brand has an anti bred day soothing cream this is a really great light product formulation that also has a tint of green to it so that it automatically erases the red tones that rosacea produces now one of the best times to treat rosacea is at night when your skin is in its natural repair cycle and for a night moisturizer different brand which you've probably heard of before because they are the ones that have the different gel for acne which is a deplane well they have a night restorative cream that you can use or a night moisturizer it has hyaluronic acid ceramides in a lantern to help improve your skin's texture overnight so again while your skin is in that sleep repair cycle this particular product is going to deeply moisturize and heal your skin and just so we know how this all works ceramides are really important ingredient in that they are lipids that attach themselves to the skin help repair the skin structure retain moisture without irritation hyaluronic acid is a really important ingredient because it's part of your skin's natural structure abduct your skin already produces it it's super super hydrating and it really does help with cellular turnover and a lanten sounds like I'm saying Aladdin but it is kind of a magical ingredient it's made from the root of comfrey you've probably heard of comfrey tea as an herb it is able to soothe irritated skin and it actually helps the skin produce new tissue so again this Euler formulation for a night cream is a really superb choice now a lot of folks with rosacea have a very difficult time tolerating any kind of a serum because of the concentrated nature of the ingredients now la roche-posay has a very light anti redness reducing serum which is a very very well formulated product in fact it is so light it's really more like an essence spray but it too has red tone reducing ingredients that will take the redness out of rosacea without irritating your skin now another product that is super hard for people with rosacea to find that will work for them is sunscreen Cetaphil has a specially formulated moisturizer with an SPF of 30 and the great thing about this moisturizer is that it's mineral based and not chemical because it's the chemicals in sunscreen that can really trigger rosacea flare-ups them you guys who have it know what I'm talking about so this particular moisturizer and it's very inexpensive can be used as a sunscreen so you're gonna be totally protected without irritating your skin and it has caffeine and a lanten in it as well that will help reduce redness while it protects your skin from the ultraviolet and UVB UVA rays all of that now all of these products together can give you a really superb skin care routine that's gonna allow you to use products that won't irritate or trigger an episode of your rosacea and yet let you get the really great benefits of good skin care now I hope this video today helps you figure out some products that can really help you out with your rosacea please in the comments below let me know what your top skincare concern is because if

        "transcript": "what's up everyone we're back Dr Maxfield Dr Shaw I don't know what I'm doing over here welcome back to our Channel Dr we talk about all things skincare and dermatology and it is that time of the year again where we talk about our favorite sunscreens now sunscreens a lot of time it does come down to user preference which is why we still try a bunch of new sunscreens and find new sunscreens that we love every year this list we're going to come up with today is not nearly as exhaustive of what we could go over there are hundreds of sunscreens that we do like but we'll just pick a few to try to make it easy because it is that time of the year what sunscreens should you use this summer let's talk about it all things summer sunscreen here we go here we go so the first question is like why sunscreen why do dermatologists obsessively and probably to an annoying fault talk about the importance of sunscreen well it's because that the sun actually accounts for the majority of our Skin's aging changes and of course skin cancer is almost all of the risk of your skin cancer comes from the Sun but you'd think that as we get older and we just age intrinsically because we do wear out of our time that our skin would just age but at a 4:1 ratio 80% of our Skin's aging actually comes from the external environment and that's the sun absolutely so we can show you an example here this video showing the arms of somebody who's been exposed to a ton of sun and the legs of somebody who has not been exposed I mean whose part of the body is not been exposed to a lot of sun and this is going to clearly show you how much the sun affects the skin the skin quality skin aging and your risk of skin cancer so it's super critical now when we talk about different sunscreens there are really different categories that we're going to go over today one of our favorite Korean sunscreens one of our favorite mineral sunscreens one of our favorite non-mineral sunscreens one of our favorite hybrid sunscreens and one of our favorite tinted sunscreen so that you can kind of understand that there are some differences between these but the main goal is you just want to protect your skin I genuinely do not care which sunscreen you use as long as you're using a sunscreen that meets a few basic criteria so the first criteria actually the first question in general people ask all the time in the office what is more effective mineral or chemical sunscreen and it actually is a false question the effectiveness is a regulated Quantified measurement and so if your sunscreen says 30 plus in my book then you are going to be good to go that's like the threshold for an effective sunscreen that want to live by and again there's like not a debate this is a Quantified regulated measurement so as far as Effectiveness as long as you have that matching number that is the starting point for what you should be looking for and that SPF number specifically refers to the sunscreen's ability to block UVB light now UVA light in other countries is measured with that pa+++ sign that you see on some sunscreens in the US we don't measure the PA plus value um so for UVA protection which is still important for skin cancer and really important for aging you're looking for the word broadspectrum so now spf30 plus broad spectrum if you're out in the water you're looking for water resistance the maximum that's allowed by the FDA is water resistance up to 80 minutes so that's like what you need to look for in a sunscreen there's one caveat if you have dark spots hyperpigmentation or melasma right and that is the idea of tinted sunscreens the addition of iron oxides there's a lot of data to suggest and support that the fact that iron oxides and tended sunscreens can help pre protect against visible light which can cause dark spots especially for those with darker skin tones it can make it a lot worse so iron oxides protects also for hyperpigmentation beyond what normal sunscreen also does so here's this graph showing you the UVB spectrum of light that's what's the SPF is covering the UVA spectrum of light that's what your broad spectrum is covering and then the visible light which your tinted sunscreens are covering the iron oxides in them and you can also I this is something I learned even recently that toen uh the ingredient that's in some moisturizers and even in some sunscreens now um can actually protect you against visible light as well so just something to think about there are some new ingredients some new technologies that are allowing to Black against visible light without being tinted but those are kind of on the rise which is great might I say because as much as I love tinted sunscreens because they blend with my skin tone and they also have that dark spot benefit they're Messy as can be I have ruined many a shirt in fact at the last aad not the the one in New Orleans I ruined two dress shirts cuz I was trying out Sun screen is just walking around the Gazebo done toast shirts are dead I still have them they should probably get thrown away nothing like a brown collar around your shirts and I even I I I genuinely think about this cuz anytime I'm wearing my white Co I'm always very conscious of like should I wear a tinted sunscreen today because it will rub up against that collar and potentially look dirty if you're new to sunscreen then you're new to our Channel obviously how to use sunscreen can be important so you're not just like kind of dotting it on your cheeks and kind of rubbing it in you need to use two finger lengths of sunscreens for the entire face neck and ears and that ends up working out to be about a/4 teaspoon of sunscreen and that's enough to get you that protection that you see on the bottle now if you have some extra sunscreen rub it on the back of the hands because that's an area that also gets a lot of sun exposure so now let's talk about our first category the first category we're going to talk about is your mineral sunscreens or your inorganic sunscreens these work by both absorbing the light and reflecting the light functionally they prevent that Sun from damaging your skin and all the downstream Cascade from it the benefit I think of mineral sunscreens generally is that they are largely physically inert meaning that they can be minimally irritating across the board the absorption concerns are less generally and then Additionally the downside is that they tend to be fairly thick and the Aesthetics are always a struggle right so mineral sunscreens I always say doesn't matter how well it's formulated it would be a very difficult thing to say that a mineral sunscreen could blend well with everyone's skin because you're always going to get a very slight white cast because it's a mineral that's white so zinc and titanium both are very white titanium worse than zinc and they don't blend well on all skin types so just keep that in mind even the best versions are still going to have a little bit of a white cast and we'll talk about this too but the tinted mineral sunscreens can help offset that for the person who wants a blendable mineral combination so when you're picking a mineral sunscreen go in with that caveat it may or may not blend with your skin depending on your tone now I will say this year uh one of my favorite alltime mineral sunscreens has come out I am wildly impressed with this sunscreen I even brought this sunscreen to the office to show the other dermatologists and actually to their houses in fact when I was socially hanging out with them I said you got to try this sunscreen so we did talk about this in a separate video and it was actually sponsored integration and now you get a non-sponsored integration this sunscreen is insane this is the bioson squalling and stin Sheer Mineral sunscreen it is r ridiculous how soft it is how well it Blends the reason I put a ton of it on the back of my hand is because as I was talking I was like actually I'm going to do a full finger length on the side of my face while I'm talking I was very surprised because it is not tinted and for a non-tinted mineral sunscreen to even remotely blend with my skin is a huge feat huge it's it's almost impossible it even will go into my facial hair pretty decently and you may not get a reasonable idea at this distance but once this sets it's acceptable and is above and beyond I think where most if not any non-tinted mineral sunscreen has landed to date I'm not sure how that looks because I can't see me but I'm confident that it's still better than probably any other mineral sunscreen I've put on my face that's not tinted I like feel strongly about this it's exceptionally good it's super hydrating so esthetically it's like a notch above anything else to try absolutely this one is phenomenal you all know that we love biossance that squalling finish is unmatched when it comes to its textures now one of the things to note here is this also does have that ecton that we talked about that's able to block some of that visible light that we're worried about when you have malasma it's 1.7 o so we're going to calculate on the screen here for all the sunscreens what their cost per fluid ounce is so that you can compare across the board this one does run a little bit pricier and we're going to continue to do that throughout the video also I'm going to shout out Clinique take off the day cleansing bomm this is your jumbo siiz cleansing bomm and a hero product so I mean today alone I'm going to be using this probably 10 times and it's great so shout out to Clinique for the bomb now we'll also throw a mineral tinted into this category with a little caveat because is it really a mineral tinted sunscreen so this has but octal salic silate which is actually a sunscreen booster so it's actually technically a chemical filter that's boosting the zinc oxide in it to make it reach its SPF label rating which is 35 this is the one from userin this is their sensitive mineral face sunscreen with zinc oide protection a really bold claim on this they say blendable tint for all skin tones which is risky with something that has zinc oxide in it now because it has this booster it definitely makes it more cosmetically elegant and I was extremely impressed with this product's performance on the skin when I first put it on my hand I thought to myself there's no way this is going to blend onto my skin um which I'm probably not using enough there but I'll kind of give you an idea there we go it just takes a second it took a little while when I first started rubbing it on my hand I was like bold Clan cotton and then as I I continued to kind of massage it into my skin it got more and more elegant with time so really impressed with this the reason why I want to mention this one is because it's about $8 uh an ounce which is more affordable than a lot of the facial sunscreens that are out there that do have that sort of cosmetically elegant appearance but this is not truly a fully mineral sunscreen if we're being honest and this is one I did use throughout the entire year I actually use this consistently probably for about a 6 to 8 month window and the more I used it the more I loved it like At first I thought it felt a little heavy and then once it sets it like sits very nicely on the skin so for me it won me over extraordinarily over the last year and yeah like he's checking himself out it it does blend pretty darn well it's pretty good mhm right yeah I would never know you're wearing anything right now although again the finger lengths was questionable well I just my cheeks just the cheek I do have big cheeks though it's a half finger for the cheeks the next category we'll talk about is hybrid so this is where you have your mineral or inorganic meeting and coexisting with your organic chemical sunscreen so doesn't that just sound weird together your organic chemical sunscreens but they live together in harmony in a beautiful blendable product you kind of get the best of both worlds meaning that you do get some of the protection from the mineral component because that can be broadspectrum alone and then you get the Elegance of the chemical ingredients too and this is unlike one of the sunscreens we mentioned that has a booster in it this is where you're going to look at the active ingredients in the sunscreen and it's going to have both mineral and chemical filters so two of the leaders in the hybrid category have to be the almd UV clear SPF 46 that uses both a zinc oxide and an Octan oate filter and the Dermatology Universal tinted moisturizer with SPF 46 we've mentioned this a million times before this again has zinc oxide and octanoate and they both have the benefits of have High having higher concentrations of niacinamide in them yep so these sit very well foundation dupes for a lot of people again it's just like a compromise in your sunscreen but really they do just sit well they're functional they're effective they sit nicely they're blendable so it's just an all-around average good product the UV clear does also come in a non-tinted so if you aren't looking for the tinted version you can get the non- tinted and the same rule applies it Blends decently for having a mineral component it sits nicely it feels good and it's not clunky so both are great options in this category I thought of something while he was talking and you'll hear me go on this rant from time to time and I saw this earlier as well green and sunscreens the thing that frustrates me is actually all of the waterproof Korean sunscreens that I found and I found quite a few even the stick we talked about before from Cho it has a a mineral filter like it seems to be the only way to get these Korean products waterproof is by adding a mineral filter and then you lose a lot of the Elegance or by adding American filters to them otherwise so anyway just a little thing that's sneaky and I'm dreaming of the day that they are not hybrid now the Dermatology one is a slightly better price per ounce than the Ala MD one we will try actually for every product in this video to give you a discounted link below so we'll try to get you a discount from the brands for both of these products and for a lot of the other products in these videos so if you want to shop the links below try to get you those discounts so that you can benefit and even get a cheaper price per round pure chemical sunscreens is the next category chemical sunscreens also known as organic sunscreens glass half empty glass half full so the reason why I say that is cuz chemical sunscreens always get a bad wrap from people a lot of people will say don't use chemical sunscreens I've even heard a lot of dermatologists even say this now there are two reasons why people don't like chemical sunscreens one is that sometimes they sting when they get in the eyes sometimes they cause allergic reactions so they're higher risk of causing allergic reactions than your mineral sunscreens are and then the other thing is that people are worried about them absorbing into the body body some people even claim that they're endocrine disruptors I think that that data is pretty weak but there was a study in jamama that showed that these filters absorbed more than we anticipated but there is no conclusive evidence that that actually causes any harm to the body and I truly continue to recommend these to my patients my own family members and use them myself and so the only sunscreen filter in the chemical category that Dr Maxfield and I both avoid is an ingredient called oxybenzone but they're removing it from most sunscreens anyway so most chemical filters in my opinion are pretty safe and we're also going to talk about some of the Korean sunscreens here as well so the whole absorption topic I think is a reasonable consideration because it's kind of like the fear of the unknown like you put something on your skin you absorb it you're like oh my goodness like it's in me now that seems worrisome but this actually goes to EU retinol band and if you listen to the podcast we talked about why but actually a reason and consideration for why they lowered the retinol concentrations was that they're like oh well you eat vitamin A and if you put it on your skin you absorb vitamin A therefore we must lower the threshold for the topicals you use and here's why I think that's interesting is because the topicals you use from retinol and the amount you absorb is extremely small there are so many studies to support the idea your absorption of retinol so low and perhaps of no consequence that there's even some debate about retinol and pregnancy you shouldn't use it that's still the consensus statement but the risk is really more theoretical than real world and so I think the same conversation comes around with the absorption of chemicals sunscreens because you absorb it but what's the then what we don't know the then what we don't even know if there's anything bad so I think over time we will learn more about this I will say one thing here and this is purely my opinion this is not a professional opinion this is purely my opinion okay my opinion nobody else's opinion I'm not speaking on behalf of Dermatology as a specialty my opinion here on this topic is that when this new data came out about chemical filters being absorbed it did not change my own personal behavior of wearing chemical filters however when a family member tells me that they're pregnant I tell them not to use chemical filters currently this is just my opinion I think because they absorb more into the body than we initially thought and because a developing fetus is so susceptive to anything that is potentially absorbed into the body I just don't think that the risk is worth it that's my personal opinion take it leave it do whatever you want with it like I told you I will always recommend to you what I would do for my own family that's just a gut feeling so I if someone is pregnant I tell them to avoid chemical filters so see this is why I love it because I think there's room for an open conversation here so I said you absorb it and I think it's reasonable for the consideration like what does it do that's why we want to equip you with the options for different things and that's why in the office we do the same thing like a patient comes in they're like I don't want to use any chemicals well immediately like XYZ is off the board and I want to be comfortable having the conversation of okay what can we do next then if that's off the table that's why I think actually dermatologist should be well versed altogether and over the- counter ingredients and also the idea of plant-based or natural ingredients because you need to be equipped with that information so you can have a reasonable and open and meaningful dialogue with someone who has a hard stance on that line which is perfectly fine and reasonable if that is actually what you believe now let's talk about our favorite chemical sunscreen this is where the sunscreens get so nice so elegant and so here we're going to give you two options a budget and a bougie and the reason why is because these sunscreens behave very similarly because the filters are very consistent a lot of them should be fairly invisible should be cosmetically elegant should feel nice when you put them on the skin and a ton of them actually fall into that category so budget option first for Dr Shaw I'll give you the bougie chemical sunscreens with us filters so this one is super nice widely available and quite affordable this is the hydroboost hyaluronic acid moisturizer from Neutrogena this is an SP 50 and it gives you that dewy look that I particularly love so um the reason why the sunscreens in the US the chemical filters are so far behind is not because we hate everybody it's because the FDA the federal government regulates sunscreens as a drug and they have not upgraded the monograph or the ingredients that were allowed to use in sunscreens in almost 40 or 50 years and that's the reason why there's been so many advances in Europe and in South Korea and chemical sunscreens but not in the US now I love this one because it kind of like gives me that cooling gel finish um but of course is invisible so it's a really nice sunscreen from Neutrogena and I know a lot of people that use this and a lot of my patients that use this so my bougie version for the chemical sunscreen is an OG it is your super goop unseen sunscreen and there's the reason is this sunscreen starts out invisible and it stays invisible it feels hydrating I mean you can see my finger and maybe a blob on it but it is invisible like it feels good when you put it on it sits and sets nicely we talked about the Trader Joe's version of this which is great too but just as the original OG that will certainly blend with all skin types I think this deserves a continued mention because of that fact so when I said that we have had 50 years of information on the American Chemical filters that's 50 years to accumulate data good data bad data and this is why I think it's fairly interesting that the Korean sunscreens seem to get a p pass I have never heard anyone voice a concern about the chemicals in Korean sunscreens and I have no earthly idea why they are chemicals they just don't have 50 years of data supporting their safety or unsafety like so I am actually very curious to see how these ingredients play out over the next decade or two because I suspect that we will find that we both absorb these ingredients and they will have some absorption and environmental distribution because every ingredient does now let's talk about my favorite Korean sunscreens because that's actually my favorite sunscreen class altogether at this point they are outstanding cosmetically elegant they feel better than certain moisturizers they're budget friendly like what don't they hit they're not water resistant like I talked about but hey that's not important to you they are incredible so I'm super passionate about these Korean sunscreens a lot of great ones have come out but I still just love love this beauty of Jan relief Sun rice and probiotic sunscreen apparently according to the comments like you didn't just say Jos on off camera I said Jose on the whole time camera's been on play it back so favorite is your purple or beauty of Joan beauty of Jo on it is so elegant it's so hydrating it's not looking very elegant right now I might have used quite a bit too much but it does blend seamlessly ultimate and it just sits so nicely like you forget that you're wearing it and that's what I want out of a sunscreen I want to forget that it's on my face this is nice this is nice this is SPF 50 PA times 4 plus protection from beauty of Joan we've talked about this sunscreen before but it really is just nice so nice that I'm just applying right now for no reason a lot of great sunscreens have come out in the same category over the last uh couple of years year since this one's come out um but I still absolutely love this one now this this one's been super viral on Tik Tok and I'm going to try it here for the first time this is the one from round laab and it doesn't say round laab anywhere on the packaging so it's confusing pack really not targeted to an American audience which is perfectly fine and but viral on Tik Tok shop so everyone has been trying this this one is also SPF 50 has a similar packaging to the beauty of Joan one and also has that plus4 PA protection so I'm going to try it here for the first time yep I'm excited uh because he has like Dr said he doesn't tried a whole lot of Korean sunscreens to date there have been so many that have come out just for the record he has a glob of sunscreen dead center in his forehead that is not from this one that is from a previous sunscreen what's your experience in this brief moment I like it I like it a lot yeah I I'm not even like it better than the Joan one better I might I got to live in it a little bit longer to make a decision I need like at least a day of use for a sunscreen to make a decision on it absolutely Fair it does have a similar body to it it's extremely lightweight gentle I I feel like it's like a subtle Nuance it might be a little more full and a little more hydrating but I feel like I'm splitting hairs at this point so this one is not necessarily a top favorite but Dr Maxfield really wanted me to try this Korean purple protector sunscreen their onion new pair sunscreen yeah but here's the reason why I still love the is andree watery sunel sunscreen they did different packaging but the product still feels ultimately the same it's purple now isant tree has delved into the culinary world and is committed to the idea of onion skin care and I don't like onions and know this does not smell like onions at all um it's just an interesting vegetable to choose is your leading ingredient right like a lot of people like watermelon like apple even Ginger you know and ginger has like Health like it's sort of tied to health right but onion yeah onion is a strong ingredient it has a pungent smell a very spicy flavor and it seems counter narrative to what I think most skincare products are going for nice that's nice It Might Sting a little but I don't know if it's cuz I just applied so many things to my skin fa overall nice though I like it it is nice yeah it's it's actually a decent sunscreen too so I just find it super fascinating their dedication to this onion and the yam and the whatever other very deep vegetable Roots they're now delving into all right so that goes over our favorite sunscreens of the Year there are so many more and we've done tons of videos like this in the past if you want to see products we've recommended but we went through things in our different mineral categories hybrid chemical and even Korean sunscreens this time but last up this one is Dr Maxfield's category which I don't know much about and a patient asked me about it yesterday asked me what my favorite like outdoor sunscreen is for like exercising to make sure it stayed on and I had no clue so what was the ones that you like this is the active sunscreen category and it's very difficult in my opinion because I think for most Runners athletes whatever swimmers the main concern is functionality that it one doesn't wipe off your wipe off rub off rinse off and then two that it doesn't irritate your eyes because you are sweating or water's getting your eyes and so just purely how functional and effective it is and does it irritate your eyes or what my recommendations are based off on this category they're not aesthetic generally these may not be aesthetic but they're functional so one that I've actually really liked and I've worn it hey future Dr Maxfield so a new sunscreen has come out since shooting this video and it's good enough that I had to just redo the ending if you are active if you're an athlete or if you're an outdoors person it's worth checking this one out so Kelly Slater is one of the greatest Surfers of all time and this sunscreen in particular is called freaks of nature that's the brand inside this packaging sorry that was upside down daily Defender sunscreen Spectrum SPF 30 it is 100% mineral this is the constellation of this product I find that generally the mineral ingredients like zinc titanium especially zinc is probably the least irritating the problem then is the balance with Aesthetics so this one in particular hits all three spots main things in this though are the non- nano zinc the squalane oil and it's a pretty simple product so let me just show you what this looks like the packaging here it's plastic it's not meant to feel fancy or be fancy the one knock on this product is the pump so Kelly Slater if you ever see this uh it really needs some help with the pump for two reasons one is when you are actually pumping this product it's difficult to get a full pumps worth onto your finger so if you're trying to do the two finger length method it comes out in little splurts and then secondly actually at this point my pump's broken so I haven't really been aggressive with the package product itself but now I have to pull up the pump push it down Pull up the pump push it down and there you go it's pretty runny it's not super super heavy now I'll put it on um and you be the judge but don't judge it from its initial blend you really need to let this one sit to put it to the test I have now used this over a period of 2 or 3 weeks I bought it as a pre-order so um I was an early user and I have run two 5Ks in it which is just partly my normal run routine I've have gone surfing twice I have exercised in it multiple times and I have used it on a daily basis if you are looking for an active sunscreen if you're an active person highly recommend this freaks of nature by Kelly Slater please fix the pump improve the pump the other thing is water resistance is only 40 minutes so for a surfer it's actually kind of Impractical to get out at 40 minutes reapply so I wish it was 80 minutes that's another thing I'd like to see improved but overall again from a practical standpoint functional standpoint it really shines so now let me get a little closer to the camera so you can see the blend it's only been sitting for 2 minutes I've been talking that's pretty good good 5 minutes later things you'll notice it is not invisible and to expect a non-tinted non Nano zinc or mineral sunscreen to be completely invisible it it's just never going to happen but I will say as compared to other similarly made sunscreens it it's acceptable it Blends and if you have a lighter skin tone it's going to blend really well but it will not be invisible for anyone with darker skin tones it will not be invisible for anyone with facial hair but again it's acceptable with all things considered I think Effectiveness is outstanding gentleness is outstanding top tier elegance and cosmetics is a acceptable so for that active person where you just need a sunscreen that's going to be very very effective very functional very gentle not get in the way of you performing your task at hand I think this is a terrific option so these are our favorite sunscreens of the year uh always an evolving list we'll put some links below so that you can find them a little bit easier I know that was a lot in one video please like comment and subscribe we love you all so much and we'll see you next year in a similar video going over sunscreen we'll see you next year",

        "transcript": "tinted sunscreens and mineral tinted sunscreens in particular is your way to finally start using sunscreens in your beauty routine and actually loving them today I'm going to list my favorite tinted sunscreens and all of them are going to be suitable for sensitive skin as well as for all of the other skin types let's [Applause] go hello everyone this is your friend Anna and if you're new here on this channel we talk about beauty style and all of the Cozy things and the main purpose of my videos is for you to feel good about yourself and also maybe even feel a little bit better about your life as well and today we're going to talk about sunscreens sunscreens is an essential part of your skincare routine if you want to keep your skin healthy this is not about beauty today it is about your skin health and I wasn't really in a good place with sunscreens for a long time I didn't feel like I can use a sunscreen because I had bad rosacea and when I I had my rosacea I felt that if I use too many products at the same time I'm going to break out once I cut in a better place with rosacea now I feel like my skin is clear from all of those rosacea break break breakouts and I am so so happy I am in a way better place with sunscreens and I have learned which ones are the best for me and I cannot wait to share them with you the reason why I'm a fan of tinted sunscreens is because I'm using only mineral sunscreens if you didn't know all of the sunscreens are divided into mineral and chemical depending on the active ingredients they include and if you have sensitive skin and especially rosacea skin it is better for you to use only mineral sunscreens that's why I stick to them and mineral sunscreens which are not tinted they leave a white cast on your face I have one and I use it when I'm not going to apply any makeup and when I really really don't care about that white cast on my face but the white cast is there and there is no way not to have that white C with a mineral sunscreen and the tinted mineral sunscreen is the way for you not to have the white cus on your face but still be using mineral sunscreen which is good for your skin I'm going to review four tinted mineral sunscreens and the first one is going to be by Aina it is called high protection tinted compact sunscreen for tolerant skin uh SPF 50 this is a compact uh sunscreen that has a packaging that looks like a compact powder the sunscreen has a creamy consistency it really reminds me of creamy bronzers that are very popular right now the shade that I have is a shade beige this sunscreen is doesn't feel long lasting I feel like it starts melting on my face quite fast and it's it's not super easy to to apply it either way with your fingers or with a makeup brush or with whatever I feel like it's quite hard to spread it around on your face and I feel like I'm not getting the coverage which is needed in order to get uh spf50 and generally with tinted sunscreens if you want to really achieve SPF 50 you really need to apply quite a lot that's why I understand that uh when I apply my tinted sunscreens I don't have that huge of a lay layer of a sunscreen on my face to get to SPF 50 but I understand that I am probably getting to SPF 30 and that is not bad I would say it's better than nothing because before these sunscreens I didn't use any sunscreen at all so I'm coming from zero to what I have right now and that is already a great step forward you can have a full makeup look that you are used to using just tinted sunscreen you don't need to apply a foundation over the tinted sunscreen the coverage of all of these tinted sunscreens is good enough for you to have even complexion and not to feel like you need any foundation on top you can apply some concealer underneath your eyes or to cover some of the little imperfections that you think that you have but generally you're going to be good to go with just tinted sunscreen and that was everything that I wanted to say about this product the cost of this product is about \u20ac19 here in Europe and I think that is not expensive but the size is is too small there are 10 G inside of this packaging moving on to the next product and here we have skin cutical mineral Radiance UV defense sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 50 even skin tone 100% mineral filters tinted fluid here inside of the the bottle you have 50 ml and this product is quite pricey the price of this product is about 55 EUR but I would say it lasts for quite a long time this product this product feels like the lightest of all of the ones that I'm going to show you today it has the lightest coverage and as they say it's a tinted fluid so it's it's really like liquid I think also it is the lightest shade of all of the ones that I have they don't have a division into Shades in in this um in this tinted sunscreen you so you have just one shade the worst thing about this one is I feel like it's quite drying I don't use it every single day because I feel like after I use it every single day my skin gets dry because of this product and even if I layer it on top of really like heav moisturizer I still don't feel comfortable so I use it from time to time this is not my favorite product but it is light if you want something light maybe this one could be for you with its sheer finish I think it could be a great choice if you want to create a no makeup makeup look but still use a tinted mineral sunscreen and the next product that I have is I think my favorite tinted sunscreen this is by the brand svr laboratory dermatologic and I didn't know about this brand before I purchased this sunscreen and I'm now in love with it I think it has only one shade I have the one for dry skin but also they have for normal oily skin the color is not very light but I would say it's not as dark as the one from Aina the coverage is very good it's not light coverage definitely but I feel like it's easy to layer it and it's easy to achieve high high level of SPF by the way this is SPF 50 as well very high protection as they say even though it has High coverage I still feel bare with this one I feel like it's no makeup makeup as well I feel beautiful I feel like I love my skin tone with this one I feel protected I can't say enough good things about this product I fell in love with it when I still had my rosacea in a bad place and I had my breakout and it made me feel confident about my breakouts with rosacea and it also helped me cure my rosacea because when you have rosacea it is really bad for you to be exposed to a lot of sun and to have sunburns and things like this so you really need to protect your sensitive rosacea skin and you really need sunscreen so that was my step to healthier and better skin and I love it this is my second packaging of this product it it it's it lasts you for a long time because it's quite concentrated one last thing that I wanted to say about svr tinted sunscreen is that it has ninite in its ingredients list and ninite is really good for your skin if you didn't know nice and white is an active ingredient that helps to improve your skin tone and it tightens your skin it minimizes the size of your pores and it it's just full of goodness for your skin and the price of this product here in Europe is about \u20ac20 and the last product that I want to show you is a CC cream by Chanel and this is also a mineral sunscreen it has SPF 50 and the shade that I have is a shade 30 beige before this one I used to have shade 40 and that one was suitable for my skin tone as well they have lots of Shades in Chanel it feels like a beautiful luxurious Foundation I use it when I feel like I want some extra Glam when I I'm feeling like fancy and I want to make a full beautiful like makeup look for an evening out or uh some special occasions the price of a CC cream by Chanel is is \u20ac73 and inside of the bottle you have 30 ml of the product and uh Chanel says that this product has five superpowers and I will comment on each of them the first one is that it unifies blemishes such as dark spots redness and pores are reduced by 39% I can confirm that the redness and pores look better after you apply this cream then it is supposed to moisturize your skin skin is instantly Supple and comfortable continuously moisturized for 12 hours I haven't worn this one for 12 hours but I can confirm that your skin definitely feels moisturized when you use this product and I don't have to use a moisturizer before applying it and my skin still feels amazing then corrects after 1 month of application signs of aging are corrected wrinkles and fine lines are reduced by 20% this is absolutely not true for me this product does not correct your fine lines it it it has absolutely nothing to do with um fighting your signs of aging it is like a correction tool this is a sunscreen this is not an active product in order to fight your signs of aging then uh protects upon application skin is well protected from environmental aggressors and UVA and UVB raise SPF 50 yes this is true it definitely protects from from the Sun and I worn it to the beach and I didn't turn at all with this one on my face boost glow day after day skin regains its natural ability to reflect light revealing boosted Radiance by 133% I don't think that this product really makes your skin more glowing and healthier but I can say that your skin definitely looks really glowy when you apply this product on your skin and that is everything that I wanted to tell you about CC cream by Chanel I love all of the four products that I've shown you today some of them I love more like svr some of them I love less as uh skin sules but all of them are good and all of them is something worth trying in your skincare routine if you have any questions about this products please write them in the comments below I will be very happy to answer you and please subscribe to my channel if you haven't yet and I will see you very soon bye",

        "transcript": "let me guys get excited because this video is a long time coming I feel like it's been over a year since I did a tips for rosacea today's video I'm going to share with you guys dermatologist tips for navigating skincare choosing skincare and thanks to avoid and skincare products for people with rosacea one of my favorite skincare products for people with rosacea you guys know is Rosa care and I'm partnering with procure the maker of Rosa care on today's video so I'll talk a little bit more later in today's video on why this is a fantastic product for people with rosacea in their skincare routine if you have rosacea you already know what a challenge it can be to navigate the skincare aisle and select skincare products that do not irritate you staying burn cause excessive redness and irritation on your skin rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by hypersensitivity to things that come in contact with the skin and that hypersensitivity manifests with symptoms such as burning tingling flushes of redness heat and little red bumps that almost look like acne and pimples but are a little different in their underlying nature rosacea is an incredibly uncomfortable disease to live with so my number one tip for rosacea skin care and navigating rosacea skin care products is keep it simple keep it simple in that your routine and the products you use should not be excessive there should not be more than three products think about it rosacea is a skin disease in which things that come in contact with the skin are very likely to irritate you so reduce the number of things that you put on your skin that is my number one tip basic tenets of a skincare routine really for anybody but in particular for people with rosacea should just be three products a gentle cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen and I'll get into the details and nuances of those in a moment so that leads me into my next tip and that is cleansing your skin it is important to cleanse your skin and to select a gentle cleanser a non soap cleanser I have several videos talking about some of my favorite gentle cleansers for the face so I'll list those videos down below for you to check out things that come in contact with the skin from your environment so on the skin and can contribute to you prolonged symptoms and exacerbation of redness and irritation the way you cleanse your skin out is very important you need to do so in a gentle manner just use lukewarm water want to avoid extremes of temperature and just use your finger pads in a circular motion across the face cleansing your skin this way is important for everybody but in particular for people with rosacea because physical physical touch physical factors can also flare redness irritation and precipitate flares of your disease in other words things like spin brushes scrub brushes facial brush those harsh washcloths can be your nemesis so just use your finger pads in a gentle circular motion and then rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water my third tip is to use a moisturizer on a daily basis whether your skin is dry or oily you still really need to moisturize moisturizers hydrate the skin by trapping water onto the surface of the skin and sealing it there in place they also condition the skin cells smooth the skin cells and calm down inflammation for people with rosacea using a moisturizer is really important also because we know that in individuals who use a moisturizer along with their rosacea medications they have a better outcome to their treatment than if they don't use a moisturizer and the reason using a moisturizer is so important is that it helps just you the skin hydrate the skin reduce the likelihood of irritation and the way to apply it is to use it immediately after cleansing to damp skin so once you rinse off your cleanser in the face is still wet that is when you want to apply your moisturizer and the reason for this is that it capitalizes on the hydration status of your skin at the time of cleansing just as you wet the skin to remove that cleanser there's a lot of water on your skin so moisturizer with its ingredients will come on and we'll lock that water in place and really helped you drive hydration into your skin and see the skin and reduce irritations and doing so will reduce the severity of rosacea and we have several studies showing can improve your treatment outcomes with your prescription topical and oral medicaid rosacea medications it's a really important part of rosacea skin care now my fourth tip will come as no surprise to you all because I talked about it and any chance I get I will bring it up and that is to protect your skin from the Sun wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen rosacea patients have a challenge however in finding a sunscreen that will protect their skin without simultaneously irritating the rosacea so some tips for selecting a sunscreen are to select a physical sunscreen and what that means is that when you look at the active ingredients of the sunscreen it should say zinc oxide only or it should say zinc and titanium dioxide those should be the active ingredients these active ingredients are most well tolerated or people with rosacea they are not irritating they do not sting they do not burn on the other hand other ingredients in sunscreens that are chemical ingredients chemical filters things like oxybenzone Ava Ben's own chakra line these ingredients can really be irritating for people with rosacea these ingredients can cause a little bit of irritation to this these types and precipitate a flare so it's best to select a mineral only physical sunscreen and by that again I mean one whose active ingredient is either zinc only or the active ingredients zinc plus titanium dioxide those are most well tolerated and the sunscreen also should be labeled broad-spectrum and it should be an SPF a sun protective factor of 30 or higher in order to properly protect your skin sunscreen needs to be applied on a daily basis even when it's cloudy out this is because the ultraviolet radiation that comes from the Sun can come through the clouds it can come through your windows and can contribute to the inflammation in your skin and drive your rosacea so you need to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen on a daily basis some other tips the over choosing your sunscreen is make sure it does it's fragrance free fragrance as I'll get into later is a it can really be problematic for people with rosacea to make sure it's fragrance free look for ingredients like silicones silicones go by the name dimethicone and a few other names all lists down below for you guys to help navigate but silicones are well tolerated in moisturizers and sunscreens for people with rosacea there they tend to be lightweight they are oil-free and therefore are comfortable for people with rosacea hyaluronic acid is a humectant that will frequently be included not only in moisturizers but also in sunscreens and is also well tolerated in people with rosacea helps to hydrate the skin and in a sunscreen can really helped you combat some of the dryness that you might experience with using a mineral sunscreen they can be a little drying so those are some good ingredients to look for and some good features to look for in choosing a sunscreen check out my videos on my protection mineral sunscreens I reviewed several and again I'll list the video that I'm talking about it down below in the description box to make it easy for you guys so my this set of tips pertains to ingredients what to look for what to exclude the number one thing that you should excluding from your skincare products is fragrance I always encourage everybody to make every effort to exclude fragrance from their products to only select fragrance free products but in particular people with rosacea have to do this and the reason is twofold people with rosacea have a higher likelihood of developing something called allergic contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis happens when you become sensitized against an ingredient and then you develop a skin allergy every time you come in contact with it so they have a higher likelihood of developing an allergy to fragrance in their products and people with rosacea are also more likely to have flares of their symptoms regardless of allergy when they come in contact with fragrance why is that so well the reason is because fragrance compounds can function not only as irritants on the skin and drive inflammation but they're also things called vasodilators vasodilators make the blood vessels in her skin to dilate and bring more redness into the skin which is the opposite of what you want to do in rosacea so selecting products that are fragrance free is really important selecting a product oh it's fragrance free it's tricky to navigate because you might be duped into thinking that a product labelled unscented is safe unscented is not fragrance free when you read unscented be very careful because unscented often means the product contains fragrance and it contains a masking fragrance to hide the scent of the product so that you don't detect it with your nose but it's still there and fragrance goes by a lot of names so I will list these names down below in the description box for you guys so you know what to look for because manufacturers are not really required to disclose the inclusion of fragrance in their products I'll list those names down below for you guys so you know what or in addition to fragrance the other ingredient that you want to avoid it's kind of very similar to pregnancy is any type of essential oils lavender oil rose oil rubs hip oil any type of essential oil regardless of how it was processed and made can contain things like fragrance ingredients that while you may not detect them with your nose while they may not have an aroma to them they can still irritate and bother the skin of rosacea so avoiding products with essential oils is really important the other ingredient to avoid is the inclusion of alcohols in your skin hair products alcohols are frequently present in a lot of sunscreen will often have alcohol so you've got to look for that ingredient alcohol is also added to stabilize active ingredients in sunscreens so it's in a lot of sunscreens and for people in general you know alcohol and alcohol Danitra they're not it's not a bad ingredient it's not something to fear but for people with rosacea it definitely is something that can contribute to a flare of their disease and irritate their skin simply because it is more on the drying side and people with rosacea just don't tolerate that to the same degree as other skin types and other people with without rosacea so avoid avoid alcohol and then menthol menthol is something that has to be avoided you'll find men fell on a lot of face washes and it imparts a tingling sensation you don't want a tingles and rosacea and some other ingredients in that vein that are often out it includes things like peppermint as well which is added to make things tingle and then witch hazel I have videos talking about witch hazel and you know it can be irritating and it really can be irritating for people with rosacea the other ingredient to avoid is eucalyptus eucalyptus is frequently added as a preservative to products and but it has been reported as something that is really aggravating to people with rosacea there are some beneficial botanic ingredient so in rosacea and for rosacea care one of which includes niacinamide niacinamide is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for redness it can it can reduce the amount of redness and it also can help your skin barrier in healing and keep your skin hydrated so it is a good ingredient ceramides are also a good ingredient to consider or rosacea they are natural part of our natural lipid barrier and in moisturizers can help our skin barrier and then also licorice root extract is very helpful in rosacea skin care products because it like niacinamide can be calming out anti redness you will find licorice root in a variety of products that are labeled anti redness and kind of targeting people with rosacea so that is a good ingredient from a cosmetic perspective another ingredient to look for property in a product you look for is chromium or color correction with a green tint this helps to camouflage redness and even out skin tone very nicely the reason I like this product is they is specifically formulated for people with rosacea and they they have not included any of the common rosacea irritants there's no menthol there's no eucalyptus there's no fragrance so all the stuff I told you to avoid is not in this this contains good ingredients for rosacea including niacinamide which as I said is anti-inflammatory helpful for the skin barrier it also includes licorice root which is anti redness and thirdly it contains the color correcting chromium property so it can nicely helped you even out skin tone without masking things so it's not like a makeup or a cosmetic it simply helps to even out skin tone through that chromium these ingredients are evidence-based for rosacea so the formulation combines the wisdom of nature with the power of science to really deliver an effect product for our rosacea sufferers that takes the guesswork out of ingredients and navigating ingredient lists and in addition to those beneficial rosacea ingredients that I mentioned niacinamide licorice root extract and color correct and chromium this also is a nice rosacea friendly moisturizer in that it's got hyaluronic acid which is hydrating helps to hold on water into the skin as a humectant and has dimethicone and silicone ingredients which helped you seal in water into the skin and trap water there and prevent what's called trans epidermal water loss from the skin that could lead to dryness so this is a really nice lightweight and comfortable moisturizer to wear for people with rosacea or really honestly if you have redness in general it's also very good this product is oil-free it's not going to exacerbate and the acne clog pores it's non-comedogenic and I'm really comfortable to wear the way to use this is as a moisturizer to apply it immediately active cleansing your face to damp skin and allow it to dry you can apply it in the evening time after cleansing and then again in the morning after cleansing after after cleansing and applying this allow it to dry and then put your sunscreen on over for morning use I can buy it on amazon.com as well at CVS anyways guys that concludes the tips check the description box I will list the key features that I mentioned in today's video I hope it was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

        "transcript": "good morning good morning welcome back to the Vlog today I am GNA of course start my skincare routine and I was thinking about those of you out there with Rosa you deal with burning stinging symptoms of sensitivity when you use your skincare products with rosacea people develop redness on the cheeks little bumps that are red and filled with pus but in people who have deeper skin tones those skin signs sometimes are missed um or are not as obvious especially to the untrained eye and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up getting misdiagnosed and they have rosacea so talking about symptoms with your doctor is one of the most helpful pieces of information for guiding the diagnosis of Ros but symptoms include burning stinging itch sensations of warmth in the face that come and go as well as discomfort in the eyes and of course problems with skin care products and cosmetics if you have rosacea cleansing can be a really delicate tricky balance because definitely can burn and sting and can wear away at your already kind of weaken Skin Barrier to make those symptoms of sensitivity worse a lot of cleansers burn and sting so use a really gentle mild creamy cleanser if you're feeling really sensitive use lukewarm water and try just washing your face once a day cleansing oils and cleansing balms are a great option to remove um dirt oil and Cosmetics first because they're less likely to burn and sting got to get the drips off all right I'm coming in with the healthy renew face serum I've really been enjoying this now this would be a good option for a lightweight hydrating serum if you have sensitive skin because this whole product line is meant for people with sensitive skin and it's moisturizing to help minimize the symptoms of sensitivity but it's this particular Serum is not heavy sometimes heavy moisturizers for people with rosacea can actually elicit a flush not everyone but some people so the face cream in this line I really like but it is very rich so if you are sensitive to really heavy moisturizers and you want something more lightweight go with the serum for my sunscreen today I'm going to use a cavey hydrating sheer sunscreen I reviewed this a while ago it's a hybrid sunscreen it's water resistant um it's all right um but I want to use it up you know I buy these products to try out and review and then I want to make sure I finish them so they don't go to waste this hybrid sunscreen is more the consistency is more of a almost a fluid it kind of is like a cross between a fluid and a cream hybrid sunscreen just means zinc plus some organic AKA chemical filters so the cast in I find is a lot less noticeable in comparison to an all mineral but I also find that these hybrid sunscreens are a lot less likely to sting in comparison to the organic AKA chemical sunscreens so if you find that organic sunscreens chemical sunscreens burn sting but you're put off by the heavy white cast of an all mineral sunscreen try a hybrid sunscreen it's a nice balance it's not a zero cast though if you have a deeper skin tone it will show up but it is a lot less noticeable and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up using the hybrid sunscreens and they say you know after a while it just kind of Blends in and it's not so bad it all depends on your background skin tone though I wish these Brands would provide samples that way you know how it's going to look on your skin before you buy the bottle because while I like to think my reviews help you guys in deciding whether or not you're going to buy something or not you can't really tell just looking at how a product looks on my skin how it's necessarily going to look for you anytime somebody leaves a comment in any one of my videos like saying is this a good sunscreen for oily skin almost always either on a video or like a Tik Tok or something almost always there'll be someone who's like I've got oily skin I love this it's my Holy Grail then there'll be another P person who's like no stay away it's too greasy it's too oily so even those you know those kinds of things it's like you kind of just have to try it for yourself honestly um to see if it ends up working this one is a little bit shiny it's water resistant though which is nice like for humidity and sweat easy to tolerate around the eyes for me again that's another very individualized thing one thing too about sunscreen is that it also helps with the impaired skin barrier and helps reduce symptoms of sensitivity once you have it on there because it's you know helping to reduce water loss and limit penetration and irritance into the skin it's almost like a barrier cream in a sense depending on the consistency especially and sunscreens like this with zinc um are soothing you know zinc can be is anti-inflammatory although some zinc sunscreens are in my experience and yours cuz you guys have told me on the drawing side so I mentioned to you guys the other day that this like new thing that I've been enjoying doing is listening to my audio book which I'm still making my way through um it's called Uh Crossroads anyway so at night to unwind like when I'm making dinner I like to put my headphones on and just listen to the audiobook it kind of helps me tune out and like keeps me from you know Doom scrolling in my mind of just like things that I need to do and it just helps me inwind anyway but you know something about that like you've got to wash behind your ears is the point I'm trying to make like it's a it's an area where a lot of people end up forgetting to wash but um especially if you're wearing headphones a lot because back here you can get a lot of oily buildup and CC dermatitis I actually like to use an anti-dandruff shampoo back here to to clean behind my ears this is an area where you know similar to dandruff on your scalp and SE dermatitis on your face you can get this oily flaky itchy inflame buildup so I like to do that and when you're wearing headphones a lot that creates a moist humid environment that's really more favorable for that little yees malesia so it can make you know this kind of problem behind the ears even more of an issue for you so stay on top of clean it behind your ears kids so I bought this blood pressure monitor cuff on Amazon I've been pretty happy with it because it will syn to an app on your phone so you can keep a log of your blood pressure and heart rate I find that is something that's really useful a useful metric like I'm not I try to not get too into like tracking all these Health metrics because it's sort of like what are you going to do with all that information then you just become like you know somebody who just writes down numbers all the time like how many steps you got in a day like how many hours of sleep and it just becomes like to what end you know what I mean but uh all that to say having a Rec of your blood pressure readings over a period of time it can be a very useful information uh to provide to your doctor because a lot of people um deal with what they call white coat hypertension meaning your blood pressure goes up in the doctor's office cuz maybe you're nervous stressed out um they call it white coat hypertension like because they attribute it to being nervous about the doctor but honestly it's gotten to a point where the amount of time you have to wait in a doctor's office is so frustrating that it gets your blood pressure up too so it should be like um you know waiting room waiting room hypertension like the stress of of having to wait anyway um so I got this and I've been really happy with it the cuff is um standard size and it it also will fit a large larger arm and it's been doing well so yeah it's it's useful and I I think you know like I said what what good are all these numbers well like if you go to the doctor's office and you have a higher a blood pressure reading on the higher end they're probably you know going to tell you to maybe check it again and you know it can kind of be a thing so having this and having a record to show them is really helpful because a lot of times your blood pressure will will run a certain way and it'll be very different in the office so that's handy to have I've got my little pumpkin back there I'm still burning the Tuscany trick-or treat candle the cupcake one it's not my favorite favorite scent I think I've complained about this already in multiple Vlogs and I have re I purchased a new another candle on their Halloween set that I'm I'm itching to buy I'm itching to to light into but I have this thing in my personality where like with the candle I'm going to burn it unless it's like really really foul which this is isn't it's just kind of like you know I know Tuscany can give a better candle profile um unless it's just really foul I'm going to burn that thing all the way and I'm not going to start a new candle until I finished it some people burn more than one candle at a time and let the the fragrances like mingle and I bet that's really nice if you get the right pairing but I'm always like on the fence about if I should do that or if it's going to be like weird and and and mess things up like I think one of my favorite to skinny candles is the Lemon sugar cookie and I really think that the lemon sugar cookie would be nice over like some of those more Berry scents I think that would be like a nice kind of way to blend those two but I don't know what would go good with cupcake maybe a cinnamon scented candle so it was a gorgeous day on this Sunday I had to get out I could not spend it inside as you can see the sky is really really blue and gorgeous I'm over by the River Oaks neighborhood where they're all these Mansions I love to drive by these houses and just Ogle them lot of them have these like massive walls in front of them so you can't really see them too well but over the holidays this neighborhood is really fun to come to because they go all out lighting up their mansions and they all look beautiful uh it's just something to see something to behold I wanted to go to Memorial Park um and so that's a bit of a drive but it kind of ended up to be a fail because actually I could not find a parking space uh because everybody wanted to get out which like I've said in other Vlogs I try and get outside as much as possible during the day it's actually really good for your sleep cycle for your mental health to get outside in during daylight hours and spend time Outdoors uh as much as possible like especially if you work swing shifts can really help set your clock back so because I couldn't find a place to park I ended up coming over to Rice Village uh area and they have that nice walking trail uh getting some Cloud footage here I just think it's so Zen but I used to walk around this uh Park a lot um in my older apartment but I I haven't been here in a while it's always a fun time let me know in the comments I think some of you went to Rice so hopefully this footage brings back fond memories of your own stomping grounds but uh I love the pretty oak trees that line This walking path I did not know that this existed this Garden back here it's for the students but I had to come and check it out they have all sorts of beautiful flowers the garden was actually closed but you can it is open to the I guess open to the public um during certain hours yeah here's a little sign I guess um some alumni donated money for this garden and the idea is like to have a space for students to come and like learn about gardening so maybe one day they will have their own garden all right so I am going to show you guys some double cleansing in action here uh this particular night I decided I was going to use I've been using that DHC deep cleansing oil that I got from sty and I have rather been enjoying it it's very similar to the hot alabo cleansing oil um similar ingredients like olive oil but it has an aroma to it to it it has I think it has Rosemary in it so you can definitely smell that but it's a pleasant cleansing oil to use one of the reasons I love using cleansing oil so much is they're just a effective at removing Cosmetics like on this particular day I'm wearing uh that Lancome adol mascara I'm also wearing their waterproof eyeliner and this really does a good job getting in there dissolving it breaking it up I can't do makeup removers I always burn my eyes sting my skin if you have rosacea we were talking about this at the beginning of the Vlog but if you have rosacea um and you're looking for a way to remove makeup try cleansing oil or cleansing balm alternatively another good option is Cold Cream like the pwns cold cream is really a good option because it dissolves the makeup but it also is like very soothing um I don't you know they call it cold cream and it does kind of feel nice and chilled going on the skin but the oil is another option or a cleansing balm the main difference between like cleansing balm and cleansing oil it's just the balm is solid at room temperature I also started using the um isant yam root vegan milk cleanser oh my gosh those of you with sensitive skin rosacea consider this mild cleanser because it's such a pleasant experience it's free of fragrance it's very hydrating it has this like slippery texture to it which may be offputting for some but I really enjoy it it almost kind of cloaks your skin in a hug as it Glides across the surface of the skin and gently cleanses without disrupting the underlying Skin Barrier you see with the double cleanse approach the first step the oil cleanser is kind of just like getting in there and breaking up residue buildup on the skin surface the second step with the mild cleanser is actually getting in there and cleansing everything away so that's why I like doing it that way typically I do the second step in the shower but I decided to do it here so you guys could see this cleanser in action and as you can see it took everything off well hey guys I am all clean moisturized hydrated got my tread noan on but um one of the things I was thinking about you know on Sundays I do a Q&A over on my Instagram and I also post it to Facebook or basically I just you know post a still image of myself and I say hey drop any skincare related questions in the comments of this Instagram post or this Facebook post and I will usually answer you know a handful of them as many as I can and I post the question and the response to my Instagram stories and it's saved in a highlight bubble if you go to my Instagram profile anyway one of the questions I got today was like how do you deal with dry eyelids especially if you live in a cold dry climate and I got to tell you petroleum jelly is a game Cher for dry eyelids or eyelid eczema because it prevents water loss really well and it also um prevents penetration of irritance into the skin so it really is a is a great option plus it's free of common allergens and irritant I mean it's basically your immune system really doesn't care about Vaseline so that's a good thing it's just like an inert little barrier support there it's really underrated for all the things you can do it's also beneficial for cutting down on chafing wind bur if you live somewhere cold and windy um what a day y'all today was gorgeous like so nice when the weather is beautiful because you just want to be outside and so soaking it all in and such a mood boost I'm telling you summertime here can get a little like you know winter months get in other places because it's really just too hot to safely be outside for long stretches of time so you kind of get a little you know the a bit of the Blues in the summertime but that being said I really love summer and I find that you know I'm happy as can be throughout the summer cuz I like all of the summer festivities like the summer holidays and summer food summer fruits I really like summer and I love the beach so I don't know winter here I I don't mind because it's pretty mild but winter is not not where it's at for in my mind like no thanks uh I'm not I'm not Team Winter I do like winter when I don't have to go anywhere then it's fine you know it's like all cozy with a fireplace and my coffee and it's relaxing sure winter time sounds Divine but the realities of existing places that have strong you know intense Winters no thank you I don't want to be out there shoving now no thanks defrosting uh the windshield I hate doing that uh I hate driving in icy conditions cuz it's not fun although I got really good at driving in snow when I lived in Colorado like I had this little trick sometimes I get stuck in the snow like in a parking space like you'd park somewhere and then maybe you'd be parked there for a while and then we get a huge dumping of snow and you kind of have to dig your car out the car I had at the time I remember I would get in it and you know you kind of like try and dig some of the snow out as best you could heat up the car so it was somewhat def you know defrosted and then I remember I would like move it forward and back and forward and back and then I would like myself I would I could rock my own car and I could get it to rock out of the out of the space and float away I got good at that you know there's certain things that are really intimidating but once you learn how to do them and you just become comfortable and it becomes a necessity that you do it and do it efficiently then it's like not a big deal anymore like parallel parking is one of those things where you just put yourself in that situation and get uncomfortable a handful of times eventually it will just be like no big deal um that's that's a lot of things like if there's anything that you are intimidated about doing or you're like apprehensive you just kind of have to throw yourself in that situation and I mean provided it's not like hazardous to your health or something you know what I mean like within reason just throw yourself in that situation and be uncomfortable for a couple of times and eventually it just be such a non-issue that you'll start doing it all the time and you'll look back and be like why was I ever freaked out about doing this it's like non B deal all right y'all I am going to wrap this Vlog up I've had a great day I

        "transcript": "what's the best sunscreen for oily skin or dry skin or sensitive skin or acne prone skin today I'm sharing some of my absolute favorite sunscreens for various skin [Music] types if you're new here welcome I'm Dr Sam Ellis and I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to the channel and share this video with a friend when when it comes to choosing skincare products for your skin type there are a few things that are really important to keep in mind first is that your skin type might change based on the season how old you are where you're at in your life what other medications you are taking so even if you started out as an oily teenager you might have more dry or sensitive skin as you mature and so it's really important to not think of the skin type that you had many years ago but to really treat your skin as it is now second is I recognize that not every person with oily skin is going to to like the same types of products the same textures have the same budget Etc so when I was putting my recommendations together for you I tried to put at least a couple of sunscreens under every category and the final thing is when it comes to choosing a sunscreen based on your skin type or really just choosing a sunscreen at all how it works with your skin very much has to do with the rest of your skin care what are you layering under it what are you putting on top of it and so you might find that some sunscreens work better under makeup some don't work well under makeup some are best layered over a moisturizer where other others are best on their own so it does take some trial and error to really find what sunscreens work well in your routine and when the last thing I want to address before we delve into the specific SPF products is the idea of skin sensitivity because probably the biggest request I get is can you recommend a sunscreen for oily and sensitive skin dry and sensitive skin so a lot of people have skin sensitivity in mind when they're trying to choose the right sunscreen for them so what I've done is sort of vet all the sunscreens in this video and I would say they would be appropriate for you to try if you have sensitive skin the tricky thing about sensitive skin is what makes someone's skin feel sensitive is not the same thing that's going to make someone else's skin feels sensitive and so like I mentioned earlier about trial and error this is particularly true if you have sensitive skin and I know it's probably not what you want to he because the last thing you want to do with sensitive skin is feel like you are experimenting But ultimately it does take some time exposing your skin to various things before you find what it truly likes okay let's get into the sunscreen products I am so excited to share the with you and I'm going to start off with recommendations for oily skin if you've already watched my YouTube video about my top product recommendations for oily skin then this recommendation is not going to be new to you but my first wreck for sunscreen for oily skin is the ELA MD UV physical SPF 41 the first thing I'll say about this product is I think it is excellent if you have sensitive skin this is one of my top recommendations also for sunscreen to use after you've had a laser procedure so it really is incredibly gentle and I've never had anyone report like skin stinging or burning after they use this product so I think it's fabulous in that regard but also I really like that it has a little bit of tint so because this is a mineral sunscreen it uses titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as the exclusive UV filters that little bit of tint also helps mask some of that white cast that sometimes zinc based or titanium dioxide based sunscreens can have that being said the tint on this really is quite light so if you do have a deeper skin tone I could imagine this still giving you a bit of a white cast so just something to be mindful of the other thing I really like about the sunscreen and why I think it is great if you have oily skin is it has a little bit of a pore blurring effect and I'll be the first person to tell you that you should not be ashamed of your pores you should not feel like you need to hide them but I do find that a lot of people who have oily skin will have more prominent pores and they might be a little more self-conscious about them so they enjoy using products that kind of blur the pores and this one does that this sunscreen is also really good if you are acne prone so if I'm thinking of the ideal person to use this sunscreen they probably have fair skin they're looking for a tinted sunscreen and they have oily sensitive acne prone skin in general zinc which is a mineral UV filter or an inorganic UV filter or a physical UV filter however you want to describe it it can be drying so because zinc has this drying effect often times people who have oily skin May appreciate a sunscreen that has zinc as one of the UV filters if not the only UV filter another sunscreen I really like for oily skin is the entry hyaluronic acid watery sunel SPF 50 pa+++ plus this is a Korean sunscreen with chemical UV filters and the reason that's nice is these chemical UV filters don't tend to leave a white cast on the skin so this is a sunscreen that could be used if you have a very fair skin tone or if you have a very deep skin tone without risk of leaving some type of residue that's visible behind in terms of texture this is sort of a lightweight creamy gel that rubs into the skin very easily and dries Down super quickly and as the name of the product suggests it has a good amount of hyaluronic acid in there hyaluronic acid is a humectant it draws water to the skin surface and a lot of oily skinned people might be thinking like o I don't really want more moisture in my skin but the reality is oily skin can still be dehydrated meaning that oily skin can still lack water so if you have oily skin but you have real prominence of your fine lines or you feel like your skin still feels tight despite seeing shine or oil on your skin you might have oily dehydrated skin and a sunscreen like this could be great for you if you're watching this and you have an oily teenage at home who really hates applying sunscreen because they feel like it feels too heavy or sticky on their skin let them try this I feel like this is a really really good option for people who don't like the traditional sunscreen feel or look before we move on to the next skin type I wanted to give my oily skinned friends another option I feel like especially if you have oily skin it can be really hard to find sunscreens that feel good on your skin so another option for you is the suncut UV perfect gel spf50 pa+++ plus this is amazing especially for outdoor activities or water activities so when you apply this it is a true gel it rubs in so easily it dries down again super fast and you'll kind of notice that's a common theme among these sunscreens that are good if you have oily skin and it has this really nice mattifying effect on the skin so of all the sunscreens I discussed for oily skin I feel like this one reduces Shine the most this does have alcohol in it so if you are sensitive to alcohol in your products maybe skip this one but I would say the alcohol in here is actually what makes it such a beautiful easy formula to apply and what makes it look so good on the skin and play so nicely with oily skin okay let's move on to sunscreens for normal skin and you might be going o how do you know if you have normal skin I would say if you've never really thought about your skin type it's not really crossed your mind like ooh I have oily skin or ooh my skin feels really dry or sensitive you probably have normal skin one of the benefits of having normal skin is that your skin tends to thrive when it's exposed to a wide variety of products and textures so you might pick something that traditionally might be better for oily skin but your skin will be able to adapt to it and handle it or you might pick something a little bit more moisturizing meant for dry skin and your skin will still do well so one of my top sunscreen Wrecks for normal skin is a sunscreen that has some real Universal appeal and in fact I don't think I've done a YouTube video about sunscreen since the sunscreen launch that does not include this and that is the beauty of chosan the relief Sun rice in probiotics SPF 50 pa+++ plus sunscreen so this is another Korean Sun screen and luckily you can purchase a lot of Asian sunscreens in the United States I've put links to the products in the description box below if you're interested in trying them but keep in mind they can be coming from very far away so it might take several weeks for them to get to you anyway the reason I chose this for normal skin is that the texture is a very lightweight lotion so I feel like that texture is very universally enjoyable it's also a chemical sunscreen meaning that it's less likely to leave a white cast now it does have one chemical filter in there that can leave the tea bit of white cast especially if you have a very deep skin tone but I would say for the vast majority of people who apply this they won't experience that for people who have normal skin I think you could use this on its own in the morning without layering it on top of a moisturizer and it would be absolutely moisturizing enough for you even me as someone who has slightly drier skin I use this on its own all the time so it does have a little bit of a moisturizing feel to it but it just it agrees so well with my skin and I've had so many patients come into my office after I've recommended this over the past year and a half who have been super super pleased with adding this sunscreen to their repertoire okay the last thing I will say about this is that it is really nice under makeup so I know not everyone who watches my YouTube videos wears makeup but I think some of you do uh and actually a lot of what I've mentioned goes well under makeup but this one in particular is just such a great base for Day makeup so another sunscreen that I think is great if you have normal skin but also could be nice if you have combination skin or slightly dry skin is the summer Fridays shade drops this is a broadspectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 I do advise for summer Fridays but I think they found a really nice sweet spot in terms of the finish of the sunscreen it's not completely matte it's definitely not shiny it's sort of semi matte if you will so it makes the skin look really healthy this sunscreen exclusively uses zinc oxide as the UV filter and the texture of this is sort of like a sunscreen milk so a very very runny lotion and when I'm applying the sunscreen I actually like to apply it in two layers because it is so thin I worry that if I try to put all the liquid that I need to get the appropriate sunscreen amount all on my face at once it's like Overkill it's too wet so I like to do one pass let it dry down for a minute and then go in with the second layer for the best application all right let's move on to some of my favorite sunscreens for dry skin one of my personal absolute favorite sunscreens for dry skin and this won't be a shock to you if you've been hanging around on my Instagram at all is the Pito daily go-to sunscreen spf50 pa+++ plus this is one of the most most moisturizing sunscreens that I have ever used but it definitely has like a dewy finish and sort of like a semi greasy feel but like grease in a good way if you have dry skin if you have dry skin you know what I'm talking about if you are oily or even if you have combination skin I think this is going to feel too wet and heavy on your skin but if you're a dry skinned guy like me on days that I use this I don't even think about going in with a moisturizer because it is so moisturizing on its own I really wish this sunscreen had existed when I used to live in col Colorado but regardless there are some dry days here in California as well and this is a sunscreen that is a staple in my personal sunscreen Arsenal another sunscreen that I really like for dry skin and gosh I did a campaign with this brand like woo over like 2 years ago and I was looking for that sunscreen in my collection because I wanted to show you the texture but I definitely used all of it and that is the Bondi Sands the daily moisturizing face spf50 aside from being a super moisturizing comfortable sunscreen especially if you have dry skin I love that this is available at the drugstore that you get like 2 and 1 half ounces for it and it's so affordable maybe the most affordable sunscreen that I am talking about today so I know a big gripe that people have with sunscreen which is fair is that it can be expensive and really everyone deserves to be able to afford sun protection so whenever I can find some kind of Cheaper options for you guys I definitely want to incorporate those more into my videos all right we've covered oily skin normal skin and dry skin let's move on to combination skin and when I think of combination skin I think of someone who has oiliness on their forehead nose and Chin so in their T-Zone and then dryness or normal skin on their cheeks so first up in the combination skin category is the nutum D glow moisturizer SPF 50 and I really debated if I should put this in the dry skin category or the combination skin category but I went with combination skin and I'll tell you why when this sunscreen comes out of the bottle it is like a very plush dense cream and that's why when I first started playing with it I thought oh this is going to be amazing for dry skin which it is amazing for dryy skin but the benefit also is that even when you apply this sort of thicker cream it melts into the skin in a way that doesn't seem to get oilier over the course of the day which I find is great if you have combination skin because a lot of people with combination skin start the day feeling pretty good and then towards the end of the day we'll notice that they are oily and this somehow controls the oil over the course of the day I don't know what magic they put in here but it's great in terms of finish it does have a bit of dewiness to it as the name suggests but sometimes when I think of The Dewy I think of wetness and this does not feel or look wet on the skin it's just sort of like your skin with a little more glow I should also mention this is a chemical sunscreen so it's not going to leave a white cast on people who have deeper skin tones and it really rubs into the skin so easily especially for being such a thick nourishing sunscreen cream another sunscreen I really like for combination skin is the Pito daily soft touch sunscreen so this is different than the daily go-to sunscreen which I love for oily skin this is much better if you you have normal dry or combination skin this is a much more skin-like finish and it's just a beautiful comfortable sunscreen to wear when you apply this it has a beautiful moisturizing lightweight lotion texture that just goes on so smoothly makes the skin feel so nourished but not heavy in any way this is also incredibly beautiful under makeup it's cheap enough that if I had to use it as like a body sunscreen it wouldn't hurt my soul so this is just a great allaround SPS before we wrap this video up I do want to make a note about acne prone skin because similar to having sensitive skin I would not say acneic skin is really a skin type it's just a skin state that you can have because you can have oily acne prone skin or dry acne prone skin so all of the sunscreens that I already talked about in this video in theory could be used if you have acne prone skin because the reality is if you're acne prone it's very hard to predict what kind of sunscreens will and will not work well with your skin what breaks one person out is not going to be the same thing that breaks someone else out also sometimes it's not the sunscreen breaking you out at all it's something else entirely but it can often be perceived that the sunscreen is the issue so these are just all things to keep in mind if you happen to struggle with acne one sunscreen recommendation I will make though if you are acne prone is for the ELA MD UV clear SPF 46 for the last decade that I've have been involved in the Dermatology world this sunscreen most consistently is recommended by my patients who struggle with acne from my colleagues who are dermatologists who deal with a lot of acne so it's not to say that it's the only sunscreen you can use if you have acne but if you have acne and you have not tried this sunscreen and you're looking for one that has a high likelihood of being successful for you you might want to start here actually in my personal experience I feel like a lot of the ELA MD sunscreens are good if you have acne but while we are on the topic of being acne prone if you are watching this video right now and you have struggled with acne in the past or struggling with it now can I ask a huge favor of you and that is if you have found a sunscreen that you love that does not make your acne worse that works well with your skin please put it in the comments below I think a lot of acne patients are really scared about wearing sunscreen because they are worried that it's going to worsen their acne but actually sun protection for people who develop acne is so so important because UV damage can worsen acne in some people it can also lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigment ation and redness and worsen scarring so it's such an important part of acne skincare to use sunscreen so I want to give as many options to my acne prone people out there as possible the final category of sunscreen I want to go over today isn't really for a specific skin type but rather for a certain type of activity and that is sunscreen for when you're going to be sweaty or exposed to water let's talk about some water resistant spfs one that I think is incredible is the E technology sunscreen mousse SP F 50 this is the one specifically designed for kids it is a Swedish sunscreen but now they ship to the United States which is so exciting this is super water resistant and if you are not exposed to water they say that this can last up to 8 hours I don't know any other sunscreen that has done the testing to be able to make that claim but I love that sunscreen so so much it's actually designed with sensitive skin in mind as well so if your kid has eczema or something like that it should be okay to use as well these are also the types of sunscreens that that make me realize that I need to try more European sunscreens I've definitely dabbled a lot in Asian sunscreens but Europe I I need to see more of you and then the last sunscreen I will mention in this video which is great for water exposure is the ELA MD UV sport SPF 50 and I'm realizing now I included a lot of ela sunscreens in this video but whatever I like what I like and also I feel like Ela was sort of a Pioneer in the US when it came to making sunscreens that were a more elevated experience for the user so they deserve the shout out I guess but anyway this is a hybrid sunscreen so it has zinc oxide as well as some chemical UV filters one thing I really like about the sunscreen is that you're able to apply it to wet or dry skin and there's not a lot of sunscreens out there that say it's okay to apply it when your skin is wet but from just like a practicality standpoint of being at the beach or at the pool I feel like that's a really nice feature and with that I think we'll conclude this sunscreen Roundup what is your favorite sunscreen and what's your skin type put in the comments below as always thank you so much for watching don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel and I will see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning my little nerds i am dr shireen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city and welcome to my youtube channel where we have a new video every saturday morning and we cover a topic usually i get these topics from the comment sections below so please don't forget to subscribe like and comment so that i can read them to figure out what it is we need to discuss next week all together so this week my nerds we are going to be doing a sunscreen beauty awards we need some applause because we are entering this season memorial day is fast approaching and every memorial day there's a ton of articles out there that are all fear-mongering articles that are supposed to scare the bejesus out of you not to use sunscreen but we are not scared because sun and uv is a proven carcinogenic risk factor all right now that has been established that link has been proven the data and the science is there so we are going to use sunscreen but not all sunscreens are created equal because in order to pick the right sunscreen it depends really on three things number one your skin type number two your lifestyle are you a couch potato or you are a energizer bunny running around and number three your skin tone because at the end of the day if the sunscreen is not cosmetically elegant enough for you to use i don't blame you that you don't want to use it and this is coming from a dermatologist so let's try to find the right one for you starting with oily skin let's go number one has come from all of you guys from social media from instagram from tiktok and it is the beauty of joshua now i am very skeptical because how does this baby only cost 10 i do not know but i'm going to show you guys i put sunscreen today on my face and my neck now i have a uv camera this is not going to measure exactly the amount of sun protection it offers but i just want to see if is it just a moisturizer or is this actually a sunscreen so as you could see here and i'm going to screen record on my phone my face is very well covered we take care of the money maker always my neck a little bit better my chest was slightly neglected so i have a lot of sun damage because i used to burn as a kid i used to be out in the sun let's see if i go like that i'm going to take some of this guy i'm not using the full right amount but i just want to see if it really oh and there it goes it's not just a moisturizer this is actually a sunscreen so interesante the beauty of joe sean gets my approval you saw it here first it is a beautiful hybrid sunscreen it is a mix of chemical and physical sunscreen it is a broad spectrum both uva and uvb and it has no ha in it which makes it a win-win-win-win um and it is very very lightweight and not greasy so if you are oily and you don't want to be using anything that is going to be sitting and blocking your skin then the beauty of joshua is a winner for you plus what i love about this one and the one i'm about to tell you guys about is that it is p a plus plus plus plus four pluses now the pa system was a system that was implemented in japan there are five countries in the world that actually test for uva including japan the us the uk australia and germany and it allows you to see the level of protection that you're getting from uva when you're looking for a sunscreen you definitely want one that covers for both uva and uvb now most sunscreens will baseline cover for uvb but not necessarily uva and uva is aging so if you're doing it for vanity's sake make sure there's a pa plus plus plus system plus means some coverage plus plus means moderate plus plus plus means good and now recently there's a four plus we just came out it's very rare to find it's not as mainstream but it's like above and beyond moving on to dry skin so your skin is dry it's always parched you're just looking to lock in moisture and sunscreen doesn't seem to help so you're putting in the moisturizer you put in your sunscreen on top and all of a sudden you look ashy i have a sunscreen for you it is la roche poises tulerian their double repair face moisturizer with spf 30. it has ceramides in it and a little bit of niacinamide but the ceramides are going to be your bff to lock in your hydration now this guy is a chemical sunscreen fully chemical it is not a hybrid at all but it's broad spectrum so it covers for both uva and uvb um i like this one i use it on top of a moisturizer in winter because i personally am dry but if you are oily and it is summertime you just need this you do not need a moisturizer you put this on you're ready to go your skin is taken care of so i absolutely love it um as you guys can see over here it has a very nice texture that doesn't leave any sort of not that you will see any white cast on me because i am casper the ghost but any uh residue on your skin the other one that i really discovered just now that i really like not just now but now spheres is the one by perrito now parito had a huge scandal approximately two years ago or a year and a half ago um that their sunscreen did not add up to the testing um and it did not prove to be spf i think it was like a crazy one i'm making it up like 80 something it was maybe spf 30 and testing so they went back to the drawing board and recreated a sunscreen and they have now their spf 50 and they've published the data on their website supporting the actual clinical studies backing this guy up so if you're super dry i would say you put this baby on top of your moisturizer if you have combination skin this guy might just be enough to do the trick for you it is an extremely extremely silky product and it is a beautiful lightweight moisturizer as well so i actually do really like this i actually really do like this particular product to do the two in one plus it retails for 14 bucks so you really can't go that wrong with it love it the other thing that i think is interesting is that they say spf 50 plus so they've proven actually that it's probably a little bit higher than 50 when they tested it but the one that they always came back to there was at least spf 50. so you may be getting a little bit more than spf 50 which is always a win-win for everyone so that one is by parito now moving on to the sensitive souls out there i myself am dry but i'm also a sensitive school skull so when it comes to my skin i may have thick skin but my skin itself is a sensitive little and therefore whenever i test the sunscreen i usually like rub it all over my face and around my eyes on purpose to see if my eyes blow up true story i was driving once on the highway had to pull over because my eyes turned be red i have contacts in i always keep a bottle of contact lens solution next to the driver's seat and i had to like rinse my eyes out because it was so bad so i understand people who are very very sensitive if you're very sensitive opt for a physical sunscreen at least in the u.s because the u.s filters are just not as good as the ones that you can find abroad like the ones by burrito and the ones by the beauty of joson josh sean joson i keep butchering how you say that josiah so the ones i like that are physical filters this one is not for all skin tones it is one by dr called every sunday love the name it is a zinc and titanium one if i am not mistaken um and it is a completely mineral based sunscreen it does have and this is very little that i put on you're gonna be putting way more than this a white kind of casty residue to it but it is very very it doesn't leave like a tacky powdery residue behind like a lot of sunscreens do and that is why i like it because for a physical sunscreen not to leave a tacky residue behind like a powdery one it's kind of hard to find but i love this guy it just came out it is a beautiful product to keep in your car in your sports bag if you are running around it's waterproof not sweat proof it's flat proof also actually doesn't mean much you do have to keep on reapplying every two hours i also love and this is an og for me skinceuticals now skinceuticals has their physical fusion uv defense you do need to shake it it has a little thing inside i will show you how lightweight this guy is so always two to two and a half fingers i'm only gonna oh it just comes out no joke it just comes out it is very lightweight all right almost like too lightweight it kind of feels initially oily when you put it on but and i have kleenex next to me um the good news is it absorbs very very very fast and so you don't end up feeling it long run it's kind of it honestly comes out a little bit like water the first time i used it i was kind of taken aback by it but over the years i have really trusted and grown to love this one it has never bothered my eyes i like the tinted one even though it's not for all skin tones more than the white one because sometimes i even get a white cast lightly i don't really get any sort of cast or anything weird left behind on my skin with this guy finally so we went through all the skin types let's talk about lifestyle best sunscreen for you're late to the spf game better late than never yes you probably and most likely most definitely have sun damage but you want to start you want to use a sunscreen that's not only protecting you but that's also helping to reverse some of the damage that you most definitely have accumulated and my vote goes to is it also has a roller inside the isden eritona airy futona actinica ultra light emulsion is one of my favorite ones because it has a special technology that helps to reverse some of that active damage which means sun damage so if you are somebody who is late to the game but is looking for a sunscreen this is a mineral sunscreen 100 it is a broad spectrum one it is also a little bit lightweight now when it has that little thing i'm going to shake it again for you guys it means that there probably is some form of a powdery emulsion underneath that gets that needs to get constantly shaken into the formula and most of the sunscreens that you hear this sound with tend to be more runny and more lightweight and watery in nature and so this guy i really like they also have a tinted one i always opt for the tinted one even though it doesn't match my tint because at least i can blend that in white casts are just harder to blend in which leads me then to the best sunscreen under makeup now i have interviewed a lot of makeup artists on pillowtalk durham one night stand which is a series when i interview founders and people behind the beauty industry and no joke 9 out of 10 have said they don't put any sunscreen when they put makeup on their clients and when i ask them why they tell me it's because the sunscreen often reflects a weird cast or shadowing i tell them they haven't done their due diligence because they're probably talking about physical sunscreens and not all chemical sunscreens obviously have that cast the reasons we have chemical sunscreens is because some of them offer a lot broader spectrum coverage they are more cosmetically elegant and therefore you're going to use them on most skin tones and regardless of your lifestyle so one of my favorite ones the o g to the g to the g to the g to the g is glow screen i have been a fan of glow screen since i've met it i look like a beautiful disco ball i love it whenever i use it it just gives me enough definition sometimes i'll even use like let's say the beauty of joe shawn underneath my makeup do my makeup then take a little bit just like this and tap tap tap to the high beams of my face not to say that i'm reenacting with paltrow because my face is fully covered with sunscreen as you guys saw in the uv camera but i just use this because it is very pretty um to add on plus having extra coverage on the high points of your face is always a good idea because those are the places on your face that attract sun so just showing you guys a lot of times this is what i do literally just like this on top of my makeup on top of the sunscreen that i've already applied that's not to say though you cannot use this all over your face underneath your makeup which i also do the reason i don't do it as much is i have sensitive eyes and this stuff when it comes into my eyes it does burn a little bit so if you're sensitive and a high makeup user just be careful you might want to use this how i just did a little bit on the high points of your face but if you're not sensitive go wild i'm envious you can put this all over your face and put makeup on top and you have beautiful luminosity that comes through now a patient of mine recently showed me this guy full disclosure i have not played with this guy at all i've tested it on tiffany because i wanted to see if this mineral sunscreen also looks good on darker skin types and she fell in love with it she actually uses it and she says she uses it as a base for her makeup as well she is much darker than this tiff can you come so i could show um but she says it blends in the one negative of this is that it has h a but my point is if you have no aha in the rest of your skincare routine definitely you can use this guy it's not gonna you're not gonna shrivel up okay um as long as ha is limited to one step of your skincare routine at most now i wanted to show them because i've told him how you become a convert with this it's clearly not her skin tone and it is a little runny you do have to shake it sorry tiff your watch is a little tight okay hold on i'm gonna loosen up that watch girl okay done but she loves it it is she also have very soft skin thank you but yeah um it's a zinc oxide sunscreen and you guys can hear that little roller thing inside as well so this one was a patient of mine who was actually an indian patient of mine who told me about this particular sunscreen they're obsessed with it tiffany's obsessed with it now the last one for makeup that i really love is laura mercier i did a tick tock in which i said how i got my skin going from this to this and someone said foundation i don't wear foundation i'd hate the feeling of foundation the most i'll use is a little concealer under my eyes and then i usually put a little bit of this on top and this is laura mercier's tinted spf now you can use the full two and a half finger um lengths to cover your whole face and neck but it's so pretty it's so sheer it's so lightweight and they have them in a variety of different tones so nobody is excluded from the game um so i really do like laura mercier's tinted spf and they just came up with their natural skin illuminator which has a little bit of pearl so it gives a little bit of the glow that the glow screen does so that one is for all the makeup users and how now are we gonna reapply sunscreen so best sunscreens for re-application and this one is a favorite category of mine because this one gets a lot of hate and it is the sunscreen powders why does it get a lot of hate because a lot of the science nerds out there are like well it's not gonna give you the full coverage i completely agree i would never rely on an spf powder to get the full coverage but if you're a girl or you're a boy or you're or whatever and in between who's on the go and just wants to get some coverage at least something is better than nothing and if you've done your base in the morning but you're going from meeting to meeting or shopping from store to store or doing air into errand and you want a little bit of something and spf powder can definitely give you that extra coverage that you need plus in the summer time it does dab off some of the oil that you produce i'm not gonna lie i love this one by tarte it is their c set and correct broad spectrum spf 30 because i think they have the best applicator it is a click click click and then you can see it dusting all over okay now this one is a great one especially if your scalp shows you know especially if you are balding up there a little bit um and also if you are a makeup wearer and just needs a little bit something on the go super goop also has one called the resetting one theirs is cool because it comes if i can do this correctly you can twist it to open and close okay fine but this dude down here is a refillable one and i don't know how to do it well you guys will figure it out this guy pops down pops up once this is refillable you can wash the brush so that is also cool but it is harder to get the powder out you do have to kind of shake shake shake shake shake um so those are two spf powders that i really like when you are on the go the super group one comes in four shades there's translucent light medium and deep are they perfect probably not but is a little something better than nothing abso effing lutely always always always always always give me something i'd rather have something that have absolutely zero right okay all the athletes out there the people who are not necessarily my people i wish i were an athlete i am envious of all of you guys i keep trying to work out it is not working out for me but all of the athletes the ones who work out the ones who swim the ones who run and the ones who lay out in the sun and i did not do that on purpose to rhyme but i have maybe in my next life i'm going to become a rapper um venus williams now i know what you're thinking don't roll your eyes another celebrities can care but the woman is a tennis player it only makes sense that she has an spf and that she's promoting an spf so i don't have beef with that plus they sent me this full disclosure this was a pr scent i love how they sent it if she sells it in these she is an effing winner i don't think she will be selling it in these i think you guys will only be receiving them in this which is sad because if i saw this at a sephora or at an altar or at a target you know your ass i would have bought it because i want the tennis ball and i would have thought i got it for free okay so 11 by venus williams hers is called game set match great name it is a broad spectrum spf 50 uva uvb it is a physical one so um not necessarily for all skin tones but a really nice one for when you're out and about and i'm really curious to hear this is a brand new sunscreen that just came out guys and i'm curious to hear what you guys think about this my guess is that it's gonna leave a white cast in darker skin tones which you know i hope she reformulates or does it better for darker skin tones but if you are on the fairer side it's a really nice one if you need an active lifestyle plus it absorbs very quickly from what i have felt since testing it out i also also also also also also love the glow screen for the body for all of the ones who are sitting in the pool or by the beach who shouldn't be who are laying out there let your body at least glow with the glow screen for your body super goop also has one called play which is a great one um but again you need to reapply especially if you are sweating or jumping in and out of a pool because it is not nothing is sweat proof or sweat resistant it's not gonna stay on your skin despite all the sweating especially if you're working out hard and sweating a lot but these are two great body ones and best replication for body if you're an avid runner or an athlete or a mom on the go and you don't have time to sit down to moisturize everything i don't hate on aerosolized sunscreens i don't use them on my face because i don't want to inhale them but i don't hate on them for the body but my issue with them is that most people just go that's not how you want to apply at all you want to hold it close to your arm and really see it okay and i didn't over spray because my clothes are going to be a hot mess and i'm surprising my husband tonight with a birthday party and this is why i fixed myself today um so that is that is also why i've been a little bit not so generous showing you guys the products because i'm wearing a white shirt i have patient care and i have a birthday party tonight but this guy i love the scent i don't care what you guys say about fragrance this takes me to a tropical hawaiian vacation they also have a spray mineral sunscreen which looks white white white white white it is not cosmetically elegant but i love it when i'm at the beach because i can see where i've applied it on my body and it eventually disappears and most people can't see the details of your body anyway like they're looking at your face at least you would hope not because that would be creepy um but this one is a great one for body reapplication for the athletes for the moms out there who don't have time to reapply and for the ones who just don't have the patience to reapply i love it just don't apply it next to your face so much and make sure you're spraying it close to your body to get the right amount and last los ninos lisa the kids the pikanitos the little ones you guys are going to call me cruel but i love a sunscreen to look white like casper the ghost on my kids regardless of your skin tone because at least you know you've covered them and if you have kids you know that they're squiggly little worms you're like putting your foot over them putting your arm you're literally fighting them to get the sunscreen on that you want to know you at least applied it correctly because as a kid myself i've had bad burns on my back because my mom thought she put the sunscreen on it or so she claims but my back burned i would get like random burns on my arm because it wasn't put correctly so the kids can you really just want to protect them they're not vain they don't care how they're perceived at such a young age so cover them up maybe my kids will be in therapy in 30 years most likely but i cover them up and i use think baby because it's not elegant this is not elegant this is not one you want to use if you are a fashionista skin anista but if you are a person who is paranoid about your kids and you want to make sure that they have beautiful skin for their own future i use this guy because it is so so obvious when you apply it and it takes forever for it to disappear i even look like a ghost my kids do too and one day they will thank me for it even though they may not realize it's now so that is the one that i really like it is 20 zinc oxide it's non-nanoparticle it is literally just zinc and it covers for both uva and uvb um very very interesting and obviously with kids i also make them wear a hat i make them wear the upf guards and i really make sure that they look like the freaks of the neighborhood because i'm their mom and their mom's dermatologist so that is the sunscreen award roundup i hope you guys enjoyed it with me on this lovely saturday morning and i hope you guys have a beautiful weekend ahead let me know what you think leave some comments below this is a community where we help each other where we help each other grow we help each other learn we give each other advice and you ask me questions that we can all answer together the next week have a beautiful saturday [Music]",

        "transcript": "what's up everyone we're back dr maxfield dr shaw welcome back to our channel dr lee where we talk about all things skin care and dermatology today commonly requested topic and a timely topic what are we talking about today we're talking about some of our favorite sunscreens but then we're going to help tailor it towards your skin and we're going to do this by talking about sunscreens by skin tight so we always break things down by skin type because you don't have my skin type you don't have his skin type and you're going to want to look for what's going to suit you best and then we also highlight some of our favorite ones that i personally love that are cosmetically elegant and he'll talk about some of the ones that he really likes for sport and active wear so the best of dr lee sunscreens here we go here we go all right briefly let's talk a little bit about sunscreen without going too crazy the goal is just to be wearing one every single day so if you don't like any of our recommendations that's fine just choose the one that you like and wear it every single day our goal is spf 30 or greater so all of our recommendations will fall into that if you're out in the sun and out in the water water resistance is very helpful and if you have hyperpigmentation i think a tinted sunscreen gives you a little added bonus beyond that we kind of let things be tailored to your skin and your individual goals which is always very important to us now when we talk about the different types of sunscreen we have chemical or the organic versus physical or the inorganic and the assumption here is actually that they all have about a similar efficacy or they're equally effective and that tends to be true it's highly regulated in the united states the fda governs this and although some things do happen every year there's a sunscreen controversy in general the assumption is that these are going to be equally efficacious so that's going to be based off of your preference your goals as long as you were wearing it consistently that is the most important thing so we don't have a preference between your chemical or mineral sunscreens do whatever suits you best however there is one ingredient that i do avoid in my chemical sunscreens and that's oxybenzone for many many reasons one of them includes photo allergy so that's the one that i avoid the rest of them right now we don't have a preference so now on to the best sunscreens for dry skin so we've talked about this before we both actually love the idea of sunscreens as your moisturizer or picking a moisturizer with a sunscreen it's effective it simplifies your routine and it also makes reapplying actually just feel natural i think inherently people are in a habit of reapplying moisturizers throughout the day so if you think about sunscreen in that way reapplying just tends to happen first up moisturizing sunscreens they usually have a lot of moisturizing ingredients one step easy to apply one of the issues i've noticed with moisturizing sunscreens is that they tend to pill a little bit more and i think that's because it's hard to get the physical filters in there without having it because it i mean one of the things is that it creates a film and so in that process it can pill if you rub it on too vigorously so a lot of times patting these things in can be very very helpful so one of my favorite sunscreens for dry skin is the la roche-posay talarian double repair moisturizing uv whatever that one is so this is spf 30. it is very moisturizing again i would pad in to avoid any pilling with it it does have niacinamide and your prebiotic thermal waters a lot of the products from la roche posay are very good for the skin but you're going to find it to be moisturizing and at the same time protect you from the sun now one of the ones that i've used regularly and my wife uses all of the time is the dermatology universal moisturizer with spf i think that's the order there there it is universal tinted moisturizer spf 46 very lightweight moisturizer i'll say it's more of a lotion than a cream inconsistency lightweight moisturizer it's also tinted so great for hyperpigmentation and is actually pretty near and visible i would say even though it's a mix between zinc oxide and octanoxy yeah great moisturizer overall easy to apply foundation dupe really can do a lot in a routine to help simplify things so those are just two recommendations for dry skin a lot of the ones we're going to be talking about later on are also going to work for dry skin because they're going to have some moisturizing ingredients so i wouldn't overthink it with this one just look for a moisturizer that can double as a sunscreen and there are a lot of options out there for this the next category is for oily skin which i think is something that comes up a lot more commonly is like how do i get a sunscreen that's not going to feel like heavy and clog my pores make my skin feel oilier and potentially make my acne work so one of our favorite ones from way back elta md uv clear this is just kind of a foundational og for niacinamide based lightweight sunscreens it just sits very well on kind of like oily acne prone skin plus it has niacinamide in it like i said for a little bit of oil control so this is lightweight og it's like a dermatologist favorite it's really what introduced delta md into the world they both tinted and untinted forms of this great for oily blemish acne prone skin even for rosacea because of that niacinamide this is one that's kind of lightweight is going to be good for oily skin i do have a preference now for a different alpha md product we'll talk a little bit about at the end and our best overall products all right so another one that came up on my radar this one was recommended by our medical assistants which is what's cool about sunscreen because i mean i'll take recommendations from anybody about sunscreens because there's so many options out there and as long as they meet these minimum requirements of spf 30. i'm willing to try it and check it out and see if it blends well with my skin this is the cetaphil pro oil absorbing moisturizer spf 30 so this one it has oil absorbing properties so that's why it's great for oily skin and it's also a moisturizer in the sense that it really blends well with the skin it hydrates the skin it has ceramide in it and at the same time leaves absolutely no white cast so this one is going to be great for all skin tones see that's a great one like for someone whose skin leans a little bit oily like i'm always looking for a mattifying lightweight product so another one i've actually been loving a ton and it's kind of been an alternative for me for the ltm to uv clear this one's actually a korean-based sunscreen which i've been delving a lot deeper into over the last year we'll talk about the nuances of korean skin care and kind of the filters they use in a whole nother video this one is the isn't tree like watery watery like like water sun gel watery sun gel watery central there's no like in there there's no light okay the only thing i don't like about this is the name it's just not truly a gel it's definitely more like a light lotion this is broad spectrum although the sunscreen filters are not fda approved because they haven't approved a lot of these korean sunscreens ingredients but it does block uva uvb it's lightweight it's hydrating it has niacinamide for oil control and it has cental asiatica which can be soothing and has some other benefits as well so it's just a great combination of ingredients plus it's hydrating great one specifically for oily skin in the sense that it is super lightweight it is i agree more like a lotion but when you're thinking about oily skin oil oil gel based moisturizers lotions tend to do a little bit better because they tend to be a little bit more lightweight and have a higher water content so that they don't feel like they're clogging your pores for those people korean sunscreens super interesting there was some controversy in regards to some of the korean sunscreen manufacturers regarding the purito scandal this was you know not necessarily a fault of the company but more of a fault of the testing agencies and the manufacturers they were creating these but it created a lot of skepticism around the korean sunscreens which i don't really think is fair because the u.s has faced a lot of their controversies and sunscreens as well no one is without fault in the sunscreen world so i wouldn't completely write them off the only caveat there is that because these are sold through a third party there's no like recourse right if something goes wrong with a sunscreen that is approved by the fda you can go to the us actually you know get some recourse from the company whereas if it's an overseas company there's just no recourse like who you're gonna go to right so that's the only thing there but these are lovely sunscreens they are cosmetically elegant and everyone loves them korean sunscreens actually tend to be pretty affordable as well i wish we had better filters in the us like these ones because these are awesome it would be better if they were fda approved because we would have at least some type of organization in the u.s so next up we're going to be talking about the best active sunscreens these are for people that are outside they're running around they're surfing they're climbing mountains not me so i'm like an indoor person so you know even if i do exercise because i actually went to orange theory yesterday so you know i'm getting fit but at the same time these are for more people that are like outside in the sun doing sun type hobbies not me that's him yeah i asked him so just before he started rolling this i was like do you have a favorite uh active sunscreen he says no way so i'll tell you my favorite too though right so if you're new here you don't know me i do actually do a lot outdoors whether it's exercise running surfing whatever i'm outside a lot or just hanging out with family and friends like it's just a part of my life i'm standing outside your window so but i'm also all about protecting your skin right i think it's about engaging your life your hobbies your occupation but doing it smartly and trying to protect your skin as best you can while you live your life that's just my take now i have two here and they're like very polar opposites so the first sunscreen is for that person who just doesn't like give a flying poop about a white cast it is the thickest sunscreen i have this is just if you don't care if you're white cast this one's for you this is neutrogena sheer zinc i'm never going to get a free sample of them for this they're never going to send me they're never going to sponsor me because they probably hate every time i talk about it super thick ultra effective if you look at my videos i wear it multiple layers like a white cast the reason i love it i find it to be a lot less irritating on my eyes than a lot of other active sunscreens so like when you're outside and you're doing active things you're going to sweat and it's going to run if you're in the water it's going to run it doesn't irritate my eyes like a lot of other active sunscreens if you wear it thick actually opaque non-tinted sunscreens can protect from visible light too but you have to wear it thick like me so that's your thick white cast ultra effective you don't care what anyone else says or thinks that's yours the alternative for someone who doesn't want to look like a goober in the sun is actually the thinksport spf 50. um also broad spectrum i believe this one comes in tinted and untended i'll have to double check that i don't wear the tinted version because it actually blends pretty well but this one similarly is just a pure zinc one it has multiple moisturizing ingredients has antioxidants in it pairing all of that together it's just a very well-rounded active sunscreen and of course with that it's also water resistant so those are my two spectrums water resistant up to 80 minutes that's the maximum so that's what you're really looking for when you're out playing water sports you're out when you're out doing sports when you're playing you're playing sports indoor person yeah but these are also for your occupational people you know i think in the skincare world we forget that people actually like work outside they live outside construction um fishermen we see a lot of people here who actually do that for their living you know and i've actually been talking to some professional athletes and sun avoidance is just not feasible for them right so we have to find things that work with active skin occupational skin that won't be irritating and you can use so we do have a huge farming population where we live and take care of these patients who a lot of times and construction workers who don't want to wear sunscreen because they feel like you know it leaves a white cast potentially as well or they can't just get into a skincare routine or it burns their eyes and so having active sunscreen is really important you can't be always an indoor person like me in 20 years dr shaw is gonna look a lot younger than me like no question all right so now let's talk about the best sunscreens overall which to me are the ones that are cosmetically elegant this is what i look for in my sunscreen so i want my minimum requirements of sun protection at least and then how does it look on my skin am i willing to wear this every day because that's the critical thing you need to wear it so i look for products that i really enjoy wearing let's start it off with the elta md uv restore tinted sunscreen which is what i'm wearing right now beautiful sunscreen is a little bit of a heavier sunscreen it has that squalling base it is a pure mineral sunscreen doesn't leave me with the white cast i say that with the caveat because it may leave you with the white cast but i've noticed no white cast and nobody i've tried this on has noticed a white cast with it leaves you with that very dewy finish i absolutely love it i think a lot of you will love it if you tried as well if you hadn't taken it that might have actually been on my list too that's definitely been a go-to for me it's weird i don't know how these just showed up in my pocket the first one i'll talk about here is i object i object okay we've not done this before i'm actually cutting myself off now i've fallen in love with someone new so i'm sorry to my old choices they've been replaced we actually talked about this before we shot this video and i was like i think this is my go-to and back and forth and it is now my go-to this is actually called isden arie fatona ageless and this is my best uh overall best overall okay now i'll tell you why so in my mind i have this checklist of sunscreens i'm like okay is it effective we talked about this yes it is effective does it have complementing ingredients for sun protection it does it has ascorbic acid it has vitamin e there's very potent antioxidants then it has a little bit extra and i'm becoming a fan of things that are extra because they stand out but it has photolyze so this is like a plankton derived ingredient and this actually might help repair some of the sun damage that's already existing and that's pretty unique to a sunscreen that kind of elevated it in my mind from some of the other choices i had additionally you know has moisturizing ingredients it does require a little bit of extra work so you have to shake it it's an emulsion every time you use it but it is tinted so it also protects against visible light now the thing that makes this extremely functional is one it's tinted which we said can be a plus for many people but i'm going to show you something here for pure mineral sunscreen and this one is zinc oxide watch this blendability just it is amazing okay and this was real time right yeah no cast crazy i actually went out and i spent a decent amount of money on a lot of pyramidal sunscreens to see which ones blended nothing compared to this now i will say this is a good sunscreen very popular sunscreen amongst dermatologists so you kind of hear about this one quite frequently if you go to visit dermatologists however it does have fragrance in it so if you do have sensitive skin just be aware of that i personally am not like a huge fan of putting fragrance in my skin care products especially when i'm recommending them to all of you because i know many of you who watch us do have sensitive skin but if you're looking for a very blendable sunscreen that is a zinc oxide based sunscreen this is an amazing sunscreen completely with dr shaw i think being aware of fragrance as potential allergen irritant is very important don't think i don't think that i do completely buy into that sentiment but if you have to be deliberate or gonna pick one fragranced item like consider this not because it smells good but because the rest of the ingredients are worth it it's rewind time so next up you can't mention cosmetically elegant without mentioning super goop super goop it's like you're almost like skeptical these are so good you're like how are you so good one uh the super goop unseen sunscreen this thing is i can say with one thousand percent confidence that no one will have a white cast from this product it is completely clear even out of the bottle which is amazing um it does leave a little bit of like a primer finish like it feels like primer when you're using it and people don't like the texture of it but this thing is completely invisible i mean it's it's really really an amazing sunscreen super group unseen sunscreen and they also have the super goop glow screen which has a little bit of that glowy has a tint in it and it leaves you with a little bit of a shimmer happens to be my wife's favorite sunscreen so super goo glow screen has a little bit of a tint a little bit of a shimmer that you may not like for everybody also again invisible super group has a reputation and it's deserved and earned every bit of it uh my next one was actually a sneaky one to me again i've been trying out korean sunscreens a lot over about the past five months actually this one is beauty of joseon this one has multiple things going for me super lightweight it's refreshing in a way uh it blends on quickly just like a very smooth quick fast finish has niacinamide so it helps with oil control for those who lean a little oily that's nice it has antioxidants once again i love that partnership of antioxidant sunscreen sunscreens block the sun damage from happening antioxidants help prevent and repair the damage after the sun has actually hit the skin so they're kind of like additive complementing ingredients that really do a great job here so for me this is just another product multiple positives i've just been loving this korean sunscreens are hard to compete with i'll be honest because they just they do so much with these filters and are still near invisible no white cast with these and a very cosmetically elegant product so next up a mineral sunscreen that i've been really loving i don't know if you have you tried i don't know if you've tried this or not but it's the bioscience sheer mineral sunscreen this one is pure zinc sunscreen it has that squalling finish that you always get with the biosons products you may have to work this one in a little bit i would say it's near invisible not invisible likes you know these korean sunscreens or super goop anything with the zinc oxide base you're going to get a little bit of a white with it unless you kind of smooth it in but for a mineral sunscreen this is about as close to invisible as you can get with them just absolutely love the way it looks on my skin like all biosans products i feel like they just they nail that component of it they nail texture feel and look with products i mean really just crush it love this one anyone who's tried it will tell you the same thing it's really a killer in that mineral sunscreen category all right so last up in our best overall is black girl sunscreen this one is one of the first that i just saw nail the blendability with dark skin tones this is just an excellent excellent finish for people who struggle with any sort of cast plus the ingredients are also on point fragrance free it has jojoba oil which i really like in skincare products and just the blendability i mean that's the main thing i'm emphasizing because your skincare routine otherwise it's going to do a lot of stuff you know it's going to have nine cinnamon it's going to have vitamin c you're going to have retinol you're going to have all these other ingredients in it but for me the most important thing is are you getting the sun protection that you need how are you going to get it you're going to get it because you're going to wear a sunscreen that you actually like and so to get people of all skin tones to wear sunscreen is really important black girl sunscreen nails it with that so it's their spf 31 i really like it blends it very well and it's actually very affordable as well and you can pretty much find it anywhere all right so that kind of rounds out our list of some of our favorite sunscreens for different skin tones we have a lot i mean like yeah this is a very truncated list like to be honest like we could have gone on a very long time about sunscreens because there are hundreds and there's going to be more and more so this is a dynamic list for sure exactly we try to give you like a limited menu as possible here but there are so many good sunscreens out there and if you already have a sunscreen you love there's no reason to switch it up just stick with the one that you're already wearing but that's it sun protection is the foundation for healthy skin so you've got to incorporate something on our list on your list something from this into your skincare routine before you do anything else especially for photo aging or skin cancer prevention super important nothing else is more important than protection and 90 they say of aging is caused by the sun skin cancer super important just wear sunscreen anyone wear it every single day your life and skin will be so much better as a result of it so please like comment and subscribe we appreciate you as always we'll see you in the next video alright see you next time",

actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big overview of rosacea what it is all the different types Medical Treatments that I recommend and then also a full AM and PM skincare routine please let me know if you have any questions let me know what

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "getting a lash lift is the best decision that i've ever made and it's always the best decision that i make every time i make it look at these also while we're fully zoomed i gotta say i am wearing two of the um invisible patches from hero cosmetics not only are they invisible but they are truly sucking the living hell out of these pimples highly highly recommend i am not wearing any mascara zero that is not why we are here today though we are here to discuss a plethora of sunscreen options for those with sensitive skin for those who prefer mineral options but maybe want a few chemical options and especially for those who are looking for things that are fragrance free oil free and safe for acne prone skin i have been compiling this list for so long but i feel like sunscreens keep coming out and new and better ones continue to be developed and so i just kept pushing it off but i get so many questions about what my favorite sunscreens are so i just wanted to put it out there i also have video of every single one of these being applied to my face you can see what it looks like on as well as a breakdown on the price the star ingredients and why i prefer these sunscreens over the many many that are available in the market lastly if you are not following me on tick tock i will link it up above here it's at rudy berry i always put my try on videos on there first like my first impressions videos always go on tick tock i have used all of these on there and anytime that i try a new sunscreen i put my review on tick tock first if you are new here welcome my name is rudy thank you so much for stopping by we talk about more than just sunscreen on this channel we talk about makeup beauty acne skin care we also do vlogs every once in a while and i would love to have you subscribe okay these are going to be in no particular order however i do want to start with the chemical options because i only have three and i'll be honest like i've mentioned many many times i'm just not a chemical girl it's not my preferred sunscreen i always prefer mineral sunscreens however that does not mean that i think that mineral is better than chemical it does not mean that i think that the coral reefs are dying it does not mean that i think all of the things that people associate mineral sunscreen oh you're a natural hippy-dippy no people are allowed to have preferences in the skincare world i've mentioned this before in my exposing your unpopular skincare opinions because that's the truth of the matter not every decision and preference that you have in your life is tied to some crazy ass theory i like the way mineral sunscreens look and feel on my skin i feel like they work better on my sensitive skin end of story does that mean i will not use chemical sunscreens no i have options here for you but just be warned that the majority of the options are going to be mineral also when it comes to sunscreen application truly if you have sunscreen that you like and you use every single day like you're already doing more than 90 of the population i'm very proud of you and do as much as you can but don't stress yourself out over it okay i see people applying like truly full handfuls of sunscreen and rubbing it in their hair and in their clothes and like if i saw that and i did not use sunscreen that would push me a lot farther away from it so just do what you can and continue to improve a little bit by little bit but i know it can be overwhelming and daunting i hope this list is helpful to you in some way okay my first option that i wanted to talk about is the neutrogena invisible daily defense spf 60 and it is a face serum this is 1.7 fluid ounces and it is about 15 at target i have mentioned before that this is basically one of the only chemical sunscreens that i will use on my skin i have introduced one more since that video recently and i just absolutely love this for days where you are outside in the sweltering heat so this is a fragrance free formula and it is an spf 60 which to me is incredible i feel like it really helps me with reapplication because it is a chemical sunscreen and it's so thin and lightweight it has a few ingredients in here to help people with sensitive skin or sensitized skin like ginger extract and feverfew extract those are both really good at calming the skin and i think they're good additions for a chemical sunscreen because typically people who do have sensitive skin end up getting irritation from chemical sunscreens and honestly there's no exception with this one i still do feel like my skin is slightly more irritated when i use a chemical sunscreen in general however this is one of the best ones that i've ever tried don't be fooled by the serum in the name i think that what they're just trying to say is that it's a very thin lightweight sunscreen that can be worn under makeup which i totally agree with it leaves a very beautiful glowy dewy finish but it completely dries down which is even better if you are looking for a good chemical sunscreen that does not leave a white cast on any skin tone this is definitely one i would recommend especially if you have sensitive skin the next option that's also chemical in this exact line and why i wanted to mention it afterwards is the invisible daily defense face mist and this is an svf 50. i also quickly wanted to mention that the body version of the invisible daily defense line from neutrogena was found on the list of sunscreens that included benzene in a specific batch and lot number i can leave the dermatology times article down below if you're curious and you haven't taken a look at your sunscreens both of these and the actual body lotion from this line are completely safe it's just the body spray that was found to include benzene a few things to note with this one it does include the feverfu extract to help with sensitive skin it is also a chemical spray however this one does include fragrance in the ingredient list i will be 100 honest with you i'm not a huge re-application person unless i am directly outside in the sun all day or during the day but when i am this one is my go-to i just really prefer applying a spray on my skin over my makeup rather than like pumping something out and using a sponge to reapply over makeup something about that feels very dirty and bacteria feeling so spray is my go-to if you have a spray that you really really like that is made for the face that is maybe mineral or sheer let me know because i'm not married to this one however this was the best for me when we were on vacation in miami for reapplication on the face my husband and i both really loved it also this is 3.4 fluid ounces for again 15 at target these are similarly priced and i think they work very well together the last chemical option that i want to talk about is actually newer to me and it is from the brand bondi sands this is also the most affordable sunscreen on this list it is 10 for 2.5 fluid ounces this is a fragrance free sunscreen they are very proud of that it is listed straight away on the bottle and it is a chemical sunscreen i have actually started to prefer this chemical sunscreen over the neutrogena invisible daily defense because i feel like it just leaves more of a natural glow and for some reason i just enjoy the application of this one a little bit more this has also become the sunscreen that my husband wears every single day because he was wearing the laroche posse entheliose chemical sunscreen spf 15 which is just not enough and so i told him to start using this one and he really does like it beyond the fact that this one does not leave a white cast and that includes on dark skin tones the main ingredient in this after water is aloe leaf juice and i freaking love aloe if you have sensitive skin you've probably dabbled with aloe in the past and so to have a chemical sunscreen that is doing its best to provide options and ingredients that are going to help counteract some of the irritation those are the ones i'm going to go for also a big claim with this sunscreen is that it was made in the australian heat and that they know what they're doing with their spfs totally agree this is new to the united states so if you're looking for a good summer sunscreen that's really lightweight leaves your skin super glowy i will say it doesn't dry down quite as much as the neutrogena but i do like the experience more and it really does not have a fragrance and again it's ten dollars a huge problem i have with sunscreen and like sunscreen gait and people constantly pushing sunscreen is that it can be very expensive to reapply and use every single day every two hours ten dollars i love to see it all right let's get into some mineral sunscreens that i feel are super unique and then we'll kind of end on the classic mineral sunscreens that i've really been loving so first i want to talk about the beekman 1802 milk primer spf 35 sunscreen this was in my favorites video last month and for very good reason this is one fluid ounce it's in a glass bottle and it is a 100 mineral sunscreen it has 13 zinc oxide as the main sun ingredient i will say i don't have any combination sunscreens here today i know that l to md is one that people recommend to me all the time and i'm totally willing to give it a shot i'm just not someone who prefers a combination i'm kind of like i'm either going to go fully mineral and like feel good about wearing it all day and having sensitive skin or i'm going to apply this if it's like really really hot out and i just want to continue to reapply i don't know that's a tangent this is probably the most unique sunscreen that i've tried in feel it is incredibly hydrating and it is basically like a burst of like hydration and water on your skin it is also the thinnest sunscreen i've ever tried it comes out as a complete liquid whereas this one says it's a serum i would say this is like the consistency of like a hydrating toner i absolutely love the feel of it i love that it's in a glass bottle although it is not great for travel and it's also very expensive it's about 25 for this sunscreen not the most expensive on the list but for one ounce it's pretty pricey again incredible for sensitive skin it's made with goat milk and it's made with sensitive skin in mind i really love everything that beekman has come out with in the past year i love using this on days where i really don't want to think about my skincare and i just want something lightweight and easy to throw on and it just feels luxurious to use i know that i had a comment from someone who said they didn't like this one she had mature skin and that it settled into fine lines and left a white cast i'm gonna go ahead and say that all mineral sunscreens have some sort of white cast to them and anytime that you see marketing that claims that it is 100 invisible just know that that's not true like it's not ever going to be true because zinc oxide is not invisible in any way do these leave a white cast on me not really and if they do i'll absolutely let you know but just keep that in mind while we're going through the mineral list very very minimal white cast on me with this one i think it could be really good for reapplication as well as long as you're not wearing any makeup super super unique okay so let's get into a few tinted options i just have to let you know if the bat like i am a tinted girl i freaking love a tinted sunscreen because i feel like it allows me to kind of cover up a few blemishes redness while still protecting my skin especially with brands like la roche-posay okay so this is the la roche-posay enthelios tinted mineral spf 50. this is 1.7 fluid ounces for 33.50 i mean she is pricey i don't know i actually have an entire breakdown of la roche posay versus cerave products including their sunscreen so i can link that up above this is actually the sunscreen that i'm wearing today it is oil-free safe for sensitive skin anytime that you use something from laroche plus say i know for a fact that i'm not going to have a reaction i'm not gonna have irritation and that like knowing that is worth a million dollars to me like knowing that no matter when or how i use this product that i'm not gonna break out and it's not going to increase any irritation on my skin is just so comforting and to me that's why it's worth 33 reasons why you might not like this product the tint is made for someone with i would say my skin tone to tan which is about a light medium skin tone tanner in the summer definitely not for light and definitely not for dark however i do think that using thin layers of this very liquidy fluid like consistency will definitely be less of a white cast than a traditional sunscreen perhaps like the beekman one if you are someone with dark skin and you prefer a mineral sunscreen however we are going to get to a mineral sunscreen for dark skin at the end of the video so stick around but if you like super lightweight thin liquidy consistencies that are very safe for sensitive skin or you have a similar skin tone to mine this is the bomb another option that is very similar to la roche place which also the la roche posay tinted they have an untended version of this one that people also like a lot these are brand new from event and these are the solaire uv mineral multi defense sunscreens one that's tinted and one that is not these are 100 mineral filters incredibly similar consistency to the la roche posay very lightweight very fluid very european if you will and they are within that similar price range too they are 1.7 ounces for 32 dollars so almost identical to the la roche-posay and i feel like la roche posay and event are like very very comparable when it comes to price ingredients like the whole shebang made for people with incredibly sensitive skin so they sent me these and i have both of them and i use both of them for different reasons so first off the tinted version very very similar to the la roche-posay however it's even darker and i think that it provides just a slight bit more of coverage than the la roche posay i also think that if you're choosing between the two this one is very um simple it's made for people's sensitive skin but it's not going to include anything kind of fun or innovative to help with your skin care whereas these include a few cool ingredients we have niacinamide we have visible we have allentown to kind of help with smoothing and brightening your skin so they have a few added benefits if you're looking for something a little bit more robust but also good for sensitive skin of course they have their spring thermal water included in them which is like the main draw of all of the event products so i'm glad that i have both because the invisible one which is white and does have a white cast if you ask me their main marketing here is that it's completely invisible i think if you're using the recommended amount which is a fourth of a teaspoon it's not going to be 100 invisible it's just not because it is made with zinc oxide however i like to mix these two to get my perfect shade so i'll do one finger of this one and one finger of this one and it will be my exact skin tone is that good for you no it's very expensive that is suddenly sixty dollars for sunscreen but if you are someone who has a little bit of a darker skin tone than me i can pull this one off in the summer and you want a little bit more of the fun ingredients than the la roche i would try this one and if you have light skin and you don't mind using a mineral sunscreen that has a bit of a white cast it's truly not that bad and i have a few friends who have tried this on its own and liked it they do have a regular untinted version as well i really like to use these when i'm feeling really really irritated or when i'm dealing with tretinoin skin that's just feeling like it's mad at me i have hives i have irritation because again i know for a fact that they were made with sensitive skin in mind and i don't have to worry about any of that okay we're getting into my favorites i kind of didn't mean to do it this way but it's just the way we're going a classic favorite that i have recommended countless times to you guys and will always recommend is the paula's choice super light daily wrinkle defense spf 30. this sunscreen is the sunscreen that got me through my tretinoin dryness that got me through the worst of my tretinoin purge and made me feel the most comfortable in my skin and because of that maybe i have a little bit of a bias toward it because i have an emotional attachment to this product this is a lightly tinted 100 mineral sunscreen it is two full ounces and it is about 33 dollars so similar in price to belarus say in a van but it has two ounces instead of 1.7 and honestly this  lasts me forever because it is very thick and feels more like a lotion so you don't need quite as much for your whole face for coverage if you have oily and sensitive skin this is my number one recommendation all the time if you have dark skin it is going to leave a bit of a white cast there's really no way around that because again it is 100 mineral but it's just gotten me through so much in life it is especially great in the summer and i don't think that it leaves a mattifying look i think that it leaves kind of a natural finish i love everything that paula's choice does i'm just a huge fan of their line and i just love the sunscreen it will always be my number one favorite however i do have to talk about two that are like sneaking up to the top spot and they are also expensive i'm sorry i really need the drugstore sunscreen companies to really come up with some fun new like mineral sunscreens because from what i've heard like i know for a fact that the serum mineral sunscreens are absolutely dreadful and then the cetaphil sheer mineral sunscreen i also heard was absolutely dreadful so i'd rather save my money and spend my coin on sunscreens that i know i'm gonna like then continue to buy crappy sunscreens from the drugstore and on top of that sunscreen expires like let me go through this and then i promise i will go scour the drugstore for some better options but in the meantime i highly recommend the color science spf let's start with the glow version so actually you guys know that i listed the color science regular just had to pause this video and laugh at the fact that i grew a hive on my face in the middle of filming because my skin is so sensitive okay carry on first unforgettable total face protection shield spf 50 the original one they have a few different formulations which we'll get to as a fail in one of my favorites and flops videos it left me with a horrifying white cast because these are again 100 mineral sunscreens they have 12 zinc oxide in them so that was the original formula it also comes in a glow and in a bronze version now when it comes to mixing sunscreens it's not recommended it's especially not recommended to mix a chemical and a physical sunscreen however i am someone who prefers to mix mineral sunscreens but especially if you're mixing two from the same brand and two from the same line i'm all for it so if you wanted to pick up the color science original and also by the bronze version to help bronze it up or i know people that makes the original and the glow version there are a lot of options the glow is absolutely beautiful i will rarely use this sunscreen on its own just because it is quite glowy but it is not shimmery whatsoever it's more like this beautiful sheen and it is amazing under makeup it is a light color so just be aware of that if you're looking for something similar but darker the bronze version will definitely be for you and again these are pricey these are like 45 dollars for 1.8 fluid ounces like these are not your typical sunscreens however again made with sensitive skin in mind i feel completely safe using these and so for me it's worth the money i also like to mix this in with the paula's choice sunscreen because they're both zinc oxide based sunscreens and i just feel like it gives me a beautiful glowy dewy look but it's not too overboard and if you're someone who tried the glow screen from super goop and didn't like it which is me because it caused irritation on my chest and on my face this to me is a much better formulation and gives you a very similar result the last option and the reason i saved it for last is because it is one of the more innovative mineral sunscreens that has come out on the market within the past year and that is the color science unforgettable total protection face shield flex xpf 50. so these look incredibly similar except for the tops we have like the copper top here so this is their brand new sunscreen and this is a mineral sunscreen that comes in a shade range i just think that's so incredible and i can't believe it's taken this long for brands to hop on board to realizing like we need a shade range in mineral sunscreens because it is too white and people with sensitive skin and who are black who have dark skin deserve to have a formulation that's not going to leave them looking like freaking casper the friendly ghost so this is spf 50 it's water resistant it is the strangest formulation again it's 45 just like the glow version but this one to me is totally worth it i have mine in the shade medium i'll pop up a picture of the shade range and the different models wearing the different skin tones right now they only have four shades um fair all the way too deep and i don't love that i wish there was more but i'm also just very happy that it's happened at all i'm in shade medium i could probably go for tan in the summer but i think medium is going to work best on me for year-round especially in the winter and pairing these two together is a freaking dream this one is really strange it starts off completely white and it has like little properties of like little balls in it that burst and turn into the color of your skin or the color that you picked out for me which is medium and it truly gives you the look of makeup i will use this all over my face and under my eyes especially if i'm using two full fingers worth and i do not need to apply a foundation or a concealer it is incredible these two have quickly become my favorites for the summer again love this one so much but i've just been really drawn to using these because they have something a little bit different they're glowy they provide coverage there's something that is exciting and i feel like the closer we can get to this the more options that we're going to have and more possible drugstore options which means more affordable options which is exactly what we all want all right i know that was a lot and i know that you're probably pissed off because there's one or two that i missed that are your favorites so please let me know in the comments your favorites especially if they are a tinted mineral spf like you've already got me sold literally off the bat once i get through a few of these i'll definitely go out and start my next purchase but for now honey's got a lot to go through i recently just made an order with elf which like when's the last time you bought something from elf because their summer makeup looks incredible including an acne fighting poor putty primer that is green which i think is incredible and very innovative to have the green counter balancing your redness plus it has salicylic acid in it so we're gonna do a get ready with me and talk about some of those new products and i will see you in the next video really soon [Music] bye [Music]

        "transcript": "hi and welcome back to scents and sensitivity today i'm going to talk about moisturizers that i've been testing out lately ones that are working and ones that aren't so it's a updated moisturizing video just like i recently did my updated cleansing video so if you've seen my videos in the past you know that i love moisturizers the past decade or so you've we've all seen like this really big transition to people using oils using lots of serums especially hyaluronic acid serums and things like that and kind of blending serums with oil however i haven't found any suitable substitute for my skin anything that substitutes using a lotion or a cream so while i will sometimes use a serum or an oil in addition i never skip a cream or a lotion it's just what works best for my skin and it's also really good to have around because i feel like when my skin is really reactive gently cleansing and then using a very bland moisturizer and that's it um is the way to go for me and is the best thing to help set my skin back on track and adding in any of those additional products or especially a serum that's active is not what i'm going to do at that point if i'm having a reaction so i love creams i think they're kind of getting a bad rap some places but i love them so i've talked to you guys about this in the past it's the svr scentsy fiend ar creme and i'm not using this one so much anymore but i do think this is a fantastic product this is one of the first products i use that actually really helped um reduce the heat and burning sensation in my skin and i think it does help with reduction in redness a little bit it's a light formula even though this is the heavier one and it's light green in color let's see i'll rub it in it's very thin um no scent the green disappears immediately i don't find that that has any redness neutralizing effect but i do think it does a really good job with that heat sensation which is what it's claim is um what else is good about this is it's silicone free so if you're somebody who avoids silicones this would be a great one to try you can get it i think amazon is selling it now um but they don't sell it in stores in the states so you do have to search it online but i love this product i haven't been using it as much because i've been needing heavier products more rich and moisturizing products and i find this to be rather light so it's not enough for me on my own but i think if you have skin that tends towards the normal to oily side or you live in a more humid climate this might suit you nicely the next cream i've been using for several months now is the la roche posay toleran ultra soothing repair moisturizer and you can see i'm almost done with it um and i really really like this i love the packaging it's airless which means they don't have to put as many preservatives in it because no air gets into the product which is what oxidizes and turns products bad which is why we need preservatives so i think that's really cool i like that the pump blocks it's nice for travel and i think this is a great simple product i switched to this because my skin was feeling very dry we've been having extremely dry weather in southern california and i've also been having more sensitivity and reactivity in my skin so i wanted to strip things back and go really basic so actually what i did for a while was layer these two so i'd put this on after cleansing especially focusing in my cheek area which um get the reddest and the most heat sensations and then i would top it off with about two pumps of this i because i'm so careful in my cleansing process i don't need to use as much moisturizer as i see like some youtubers use um so when i see people doing seven eight pumps of this um maybe for some people that's necessary also the the size of your face you know the amount of skin you need to cover of course that plays into it too but i do question what those people are just like what is their cleansing routine like and is it drying their skin to the point that they're needing this excessive amount of moisturizer to rebalance the skin one of the best cleansing videos i've ever watched was um posted on into the gloss i'll link it below it's on their youtube channel and it's of a french esthetician isabel bellis is her name and she works for the skincare brand slash esthetician named joelle ciocco and they are very famous i a lot of um famous people go to them things like that but her cleansing video is really really helpful to understand how to cleanse the skin properly as well as what your skin should feel like at the end and then they did a moisturizing video as a secondary to that one and you'll see she uses very little moisturizer and she talks about how with your cleansing process if you find the right process that balances out your skin you won't need that much moisturizing and you don't want to overload your skin you put just enough so i know that was a tangent but i can't really talk about skincare moisturizing or anything else without talking about cleansing because it is the foundation in my opinion it is the thing that um makes the biggest difference besides eliminating ingredients that are irritating from your products in my opinion so what can i say about this it's soothing it's hydrating it's creamy it's i would say medium to rich it's not super rich it doesn't feel super occlusive you're not gonna put this on and start sweating like it feels like a glove or a mask on your skin it absorbs well um it does have silicones in it so i will say that if you're avoiding silicones for whatever reason you know this won't be a good choice for you but um my skin doesn't seem to be negatively affected by silicones so i you know i wanted to try this out and i think it's very good i will repurchase this so highly recommend that as the weather kept getting drier and drier i actually needed even more moisturization than that and part of the issue is and i talked about this in my recent cleansing video i tried a foaming cleanser for about a week and a half and that actually really dried out and irritated my skin so to repair it i switched from this combo to this plus this and this was another new find this is also la roche posay this is also a very popular product that's talked about a lot in blogs and forums and reddit in the rosacea community and it is the la roche-posay sika plast bom b5 and i had not tried this in the past um i think because i was just you know interested in other things and i didn't have dry flaky skin but after using this foamy cleanser i was starting to get these flaky patches and with the dry weather i needed something more protective and i had researched and read that this was really good to protect against wind burn and things like that which you know i i was basically feeling that that was the equivalent to what was going on because it's like that idea of trans epidermal water loss where the water is getting sucked out of the skin and flaking the top layers of the epidermis so i needed something more occlusive and more protective so i went ahead and purchased this and tried it and i think it's fantastic it's actually been doing a really good job at not only healing the dry skin i had and keeping me much more moist and supple but also reducing redness which i you know didn't anticipate as a side effect so it has panthenol and it has matic which is the other name for centella asiatica which has been a very popular ingredient now for several years it kind of became a hit from the asian beauty world and a lot of people have been saying how great it is for inflammation anti-irritation calming and soothing the skin and i had never tried a product with that ingredient before and to be honest if i had known it was in this i probably would have tried this sooner but i didn't know that so once i purchased it and i read over the ingredients again i noticed it had that so it was very curious so this product comes out very thick it's like a paste no scent no fragrance it's almost like a diaper cream you see how it doesn't rub in quickly like the other one like for example if i put the laroche tolerance here you'll see that this is going to disappear look no white residue whereas this is like feels more oily and thick but very nice if you like that feeling of a balm or a rich cream almost like kind of like that la mere texture um it does absorb well after a while so what i do is i use this as my all-over moisturizer and then i'll put a little dollop of this on my finger pads and i'll spread it out to kind of sheer it out and then i'll just gently pat it over the really dry area so this is more like a spot healing moisturizer for me so really been focusing it in this area and like the sides of my nose from blowing my nose allergies things like that that way i'm not rubbing because it's such a thick product if you put a lot of it on you might have to massage quite a bit which can be too stimulating for your skin so by pressing it on top it sort of seals everything and creates a barrier and the product slowly seeps in when i wake up in the morning there's no residue and no residue on my pillow or anything like that but my skin has been getting healthier and healthier and stronger and calmer and it took about a week and a half to do the damage of the dry flaky patches on my skin with that cleanser and it took about a week using this on top of this after double cleansing to heal that and get rid of all that flaky skin and have my skin back to normal so this is what i'm using at night this followed by this and then in the morning i'm doing this followed by a little bit of this again in that cheek area just because it's been so dry and then my sunblock and i've been loving this so it does have silicones in it again so if that's something you're avoiding i'm sorry i wish i had better news for you but if you aren't avoiding silicones for any specific reason and you are struggling with really dry skin or patches of dry irritated skin i would definitely recommend this and then if you don't like it it's safe enough for babies and children or you could use it on hands knees elbows things like that so i'm really liking the zika plus bone okay so this is a couple weeks later since filming that and i've been testing out a new moisturizer so i wanted to add this one to the list before the video goes out because i'm really liking it and it's one a lot of you have probably come across in your research it's the bioderma scentsy bio ar sensitive skin prone to rosacea anti-redness care so i got this um it was buy one get one fifty percent off at walgreens and um i was almost out of the la roche posay um tolarion so i wanted to try this i patch tested it for a couple weeks with no issues and then i started using it and i really like it um it's silicone free but it does have mineral oil so you know it really depends on if you're trying to avoid certain ingredients or not it also has ingredients that are supposedly calming for the skin like seaweed extracts and some other things it's not oil-free either but i find it to be actually more hydrating and moisturizing than the tolarian ultra by la roche posay so and i wanted to try something that had a little bit more ingredients for reducing redless i think it also has licorice in it um so yeah i'm really liking it scent free i think it absorbs well and it does leave my skin feeling like really soft and plump um at night a lot of the times i'm still putting the zika balm all on top on my cheeks because it's just been so dry lately but i do think this one is more moisturizing on its own than the tolarion so if you've tried that in the past and you didn't find it moisturizing enough or you want something that has a few more ingredients that might help combat your redness i would definitely say to give this a try it's 1.33 ounces so yeah and i just squeeze i'll show you the texture uh i just squeeze a cup of dots onto my face it's a nice cream no scent and yeah i really like the texture a lot it's just absorbs nicely it feels really good so i'm really really happy with that and um it might be one worth checking out especially when it's on sale and they know dermstore sells la roche-posay event and um bioderma so when they have sales it's a great time to stock up or try a couple of different uh products and then finally i've been using a new sunscreen for a couple of months that i have been loving i really wanted to use a non-waterproof sunscreen for my daily wear and typically what i've been using in that capacity is the neutrogena redness relieving spf 20 moisturizer i still really like that product it never irritated my skin i didn't get sunburned with it although it's not what i would wear if i was like going to the beach or on a hike the problem is the tint is too orangey and i feel like as it oxidizes not only over the course of the day but also as it gets older within the tub so what starts out you know when you have a full fresh bottle as a mildly orange dark tint gets oranger and orange as time goes by and it just really wasn't matching my skin like you would literally see a delineation mark or if i didn't rub it in well you'd see these patches and that just wasn't going to work so i'd been doing some research and exploring and i had considered several different options but i ended up with the skin medica essential defense mineral shield broad spectrum spf 32 sunscreen it is not waterproof and it is tinted and i am liking it very much i've been using it for about two months now it's made for post-procedure skin so it's you know the ingredients are for hypersensitive skin it does have silicones in it it also has caffeine in it which works for some people's skin with rosacea and others know but i've been liking it a lot so i'll show you what it's like the tint is a little dark but because it's more sheer than the new than the cetaphil it rubs in better and it is still a lighter tint than the cedar fill so it looks like that and it just rubs right in and what i like about this no smell um what i like about this is it's very moisturizing without feeling oily or greasy or heavy so like i've been saying i've been going through about a really dry skin and the weather has been extremely dry here so i'm all about the moisture right now and so doing my moisturization routine and then topping it off with this sunscreen one to two pumps has been really nice and i don't get oily throughout the day it doesn't feel heavy it's very easy to wash off at the end of the night yeah no reactions so i got this on derm store i would highly recommend it i love the pump application i think it's a really good product and i think it could work for a variety of skin types so if you're less dry than me you might not even need moisturizer or if you're living in a humid climate you might just be able to you know refresh your skin in the morning and go in with this as your sunblock and moisturizer which is nice because combo products are always great um because i feel like it's that moisturizing um but yeah it doesn't really leave you shiny at least i don't think so this is me after a day of work i've been wearing it all day no powder [Music] so again i have very dry skin but i don't feel like it makes me look oily at all um and that's kind of all i can say about that i i'm loving this i'll definitely repurchase it it's way more expensive than the cetaphil but the tint alone makes it much preferable for me especially since i don't wear foundation i need the color to match my skin or at least match better than the cetaphil was maybe when i get if i ever get more tan again that one will work but since i'm so good about staying out of the sun now because of my rosacea my skin has gotten more and more fair and i needed a better skin tone matching product so that's it for today i hope you enjoyed this video comment below with what moisturizers are really working for your skin or if you have any questions about products i mentioned or any other products you're looking at that seem interesting to you and i will see you again soon thanks so much for watching",

        "transcript": "April is rosacea awareness a month and for those of you who know me in the channel you know that I've posted a lot about my struggles with rosacea some of the products that I've used to help overcome it and I say overcome it kind of loosely um I've come to terms with it I recognize what my triggers are I understand better how to maintain My Skin Barrier and most importantly focus on the treatments and medications that give me the best outcome for my skin I will say rosacea is definitely a marathon and not a Sprint as is most things with skin care there's rarely an overnight success or magic treatment that's gonna solve all your skin issues no matter what they are but certainly that's the case with rosacea at least that's been my experience while I have my rosacea pretty much under control I still have flare-ups I still have irritation I still kind of regress backwards so I just wanted to kind of sit back relax and do a little bit of an update video for you on how my rosacea my skin is doing now and what I attribute My Success to my skin in at its lowest point look like this but you can see now I specifically for today's video I'm not wearing any foundation BB cream CC cream I chose a tinted mineral sunscreen it's really new to me it was sent to me in PR it's naked Sunday's tinted mineral sunscreen I like the tinted mineral sunscreens of course because they offset the white cast overall my skin is just so much better than it was not to say that I don't still have flare-ups I do especially when I ignore my triggers which I know full well what they are red wine which sucks because I love red wine spicy foods also sucks I love spicy foods and my husband likes to cook spicy foods so yeah sometimes I have to suffer through the aftermath with my skin and the sun it's very hard to avoid the Sun but I do my best to mitigate that so I will wear a hat when I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time and I always always wear a daily sunscreen my view on sunscreen is honestly just find one you love and you use that speaking of setbacks recently I was traveling staying in a hotel room you know the air is different in the hotel room I was drinking red wine with dinner the climate was slightly different you can see on my face here how my rosacea flares and it's almost immediately so as much as I try to control my triggers and set the situation to be optimal for Success it still happens I'll tell you what I did in my story and hopefully you can just extrapolate from that something that may be useful for you of course you should be in consultation with a medical professional I'm not that I'm simply here to share with you my story and my experience so that hopefully it can arm you with some more information and help you along the way if nothing else to know you're not alone the Hallmarks on my rosacea is an impaired barrier Associated redness and flushing irritation inflammation and pimples back when it was at its worst this is what I did I stopped everything in my skincare routine basically put myself on a skincare diet I I went back to the very basics of cleansing and moisturizing my skin and when it comes to Cleansing just choose a cleanser that's very gentle and hydrating that's what worked for me I've used this Cetaphil Vana cream was one of my favorites uh this one by avino continues to be one of my favorites it's their common restore line and I wanted to call out this one this is the glucoside foaming cleanser and while this is a new launch from the ordinary I've been really enjoying this product for my skin my children have been using it too and they also have very sensitive skin it was tested on babies originally and it's just been a really lovely cleanser so back then when I was at my worst I wish I would have had something like this too I've also used cerave's hydrating cleanser it's really just about finding the one that works best for you within your price point I only cleanse my skin at night with a cleanser in the morning I use water only this is one of the ways I was able to keep my barrier intact the cleansing process just seemed to be too much for my skin if I was doing it morning and night so that was really a game changer for me for moisturizers I like to offer something that's rich in ceramides and that is a little bit occlusive to lock that moisture into the skin because one of the Hallmarks of rosacea is a damaged Skin Barrier it has trouble holding and retaining that moisture into the skin so if you can do that with your moisturizer you're ahead of the game so cerave's moisturizing lotion is a great one love regimen Labs cream this is their second iteration of this particular product they've actually improved the consistency and the applicability of this on the skin it's far less thick and more spreadable I'd say on the skin and this one's fabulous because it has ceramides as does the CeraVe one it's a higher price point for this but I just really love this brand for a gel type moisturizer going back to Aveeno this common restore line has just been really good for my skin I love this it's drugstore so it's readily accessible and great for my combination skin sometimes I don't want a thick Rich moisturizer this can be great in the morning and a thicker richer cream in the evening is sometimes what I opt for but another new launch from the ordinary they've improved or added to their natural moisturizing factors line and this one is their natural moisturizing factors plus phytoceramides so again just adding more ceramides into the formulation making this a really good moisturizer for rosacea in my opinion and also for those of you with dry skin when it comes to daily sunscreen my opinion just find one that works for you whether it's chemical mineral hybrid whatever it is tinted non-tinted cheap expensive if you're gonna put it on your face every day go with that one I'm being facetious because sometimes sunscreen can be irritating to some and you want to find the one that best suits your skin I've actually created a shop my which really lists the products that are my favorites by category those are affiliate links so you don't have to purchase through through those just look at what the products are and then you can Google and purchase on your own because otherwise I make a very small commission if you purchase from those links so if you want to great and thank you if you don't totally fine as well but the point is to be able to share with you what my favorites are by genre so I'll link my favorites below for my sunscreen category so you can take a look through there ask me specific questions in the comments if you have about any particular product all of the ones that are listed there are ones that have worked for my skin so I hope you find that helpful I did want to call it this product that came to me in PR this is by Dr jard it's your secret pair tiger grass Camp drops they're really neat and it's green looks kind of gross but if you know the color wheel green offsets or neutralizes red now this is an SPF 35 but I actually use this kind of more like makeup and then it's just giving me that additional sun protection so I apply whatever sunscreen I'm wearing wearing for the day and then I put a few drops of this over top and it really neutralizes the red so I'm kind of almost using it like makeup as opposed to sunscreen but definitely impressed with this product for me Beyond getting a basic skincare routine in place and focusing on restoring and repairing My Skin Barrier without adding in any active ingredients like retinoids and vitamin Cs and acids and all that stuff just keeping it to the basics I also needed medical intervention so at the time I was prescribed this which is metrogel this is an antibiotic gel often used for people who struggle with rosacea I can say that this was definitely responsible for getting my rosacea under control in that kind of acute flare-up phase that I was in once My Skin Barrier was intact and things were calmed down settled down that's when I could reintroduce the active ingredients into my skincare routine such as my vitamin C retinoids Etc so just because I have rosacea doesn't mean that I can't capitalize on those things it's just sometimes I have to opt for versions that are more sensitive skin friendly and when I have a flare-up I kind of revert back to the basics again just to be sure my Skin's under control before I reintroduce those active ingredients in my skincare routines the next thing and it's no surprise for those of you who have watched my channel for a while it's the thing that I actually attribute my kind of ongoing success with my rosacea is azelic acid I feel like it is really responsible for keeping my rosacea obey and maintaining My Skin Barrier overall I have used over-the-counter acelaic acid serums for years and I can say some of my favorites are Paula's Choice 10 azoleic acid booster and this one by theramid it's their acid or azid I'm not sure how it's pronounced but this one's at 15 azaleaic acid I was impressed with this one because it's actually the same percentage of azelic acid as my prescription and strength osoletic acid and I fairly recently started this prescription phenacea finessia tomato tomato I'm not sure but it's a 15 prescription only here in Canada as oleic acid now the different approach I've had with this one versus the other ones is that I was normally using those once a day generally in my morning skincare routine paired with my vitamin C but I've been using this one now for about six weeks twice a day morning and evening skincare routine it's another reason I love this as a product azelic acid it pairs well with so many other things it really doesn't have conflicts you don't have to worry about it I use it in my evening skincare routine paired with my retinoid in my morning skincare routine pair with my vitamin C the only thing I don't do is I don't put it in the same routine as my acid day when I use my aha or Alpha hydroxy acid it's once a week and I just focus on the acid and hydrating skin care products to surround that routine I'm only six weeks into this sort of regime so I will definitely do an update for you later on but already I am reaping the benefits of this overall I can feel that my skin is just more calm and healthy azelic acid has so many health benefits for the skin especially for rosacea it works to decrease the swelling the associated redness but is really effective at targeting the bacteria that's in the pores that can also contribute to the pimples associated with rosacea making this also a great product or great ingredient for those of you with acne prone skin of course there can be Associated side effects I think primarily those are tingling stinging and even drawing of the skin I personally haven't had that experience so I'd love to hear from those of you who perhaps have had that experience you can share that in the comments section below but certainly if you're using a prescription nasolic acid you'd be in consultation with a medical professional and of course they'd be able to talk to you more about that but if you're using OTC or over-the-counter azoleic acids just be aware you're experiencing that as well I will continue to monitor my rosacea with you and I'll do more updates as we go along and just see how my journey goes because I'm hoping it's helping you to understand more about the disease and spreading awareness which is what the April rosacea awareness month is all about I'll drop some information on that in particular below I would really really love it if you would share your thoughts experiences comments in the comments section below if you haven't watched them already be sure to watch these videos up on screen and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "sun protection is an important part of any acne and rosacea skincare routine both acne and rosacea can be worsened by UV radiation from the Sun and some of our common treatments like retinoids and retinols can make our skin more sensitive to the sun therefore when treating acne and racea sun protection is Paramount I'm Dr John Barbieri a board-certified dermatologist in acne and racea expert at Harvard Medical School in this video I want to break down how do we pick a sunscreen for AC racea prone skin now I'm going to take a bit of a different approach than what we see in a lot of AC and racea skincare videos I'm actually not going to give you a list of products that I recommend rather than tell you what products I like I want to teach you how to go to the store or go online and find a sun screens right for your skin that way as formulations and Brands change over time you'll still be armed with information to help you pick the right sunscreen the first thing to consider when choosing a sunscreen is how well does it block the sun in general for AC andace prone skin I recommend picking a sunscreen that's at least SPF 30 to 50 if not potentially slightly higher when it comes to how sunscreens block the sun there are two main sets of ingredients that do this we have chemical blockers like oxybenzone and avo benzone and then we have mineral or physical sunscreens that use things like zinc or titanium dioxide to block the sun now each of these types of sun screens has strengths and weaknesses chemical sunscreens can have the advantage of sometimes feeling more lightweight on the skin sometimes rubbing in easier and potentially being less likely to leave a white cast on the skin however chemical sunscreens sometimes have more of an odor sometimes they can feel a bit more sticky on the skin and because chemical sunscreens can't be absorbed into the body in small concentrations there have been concerns about the safety of these when we look at the data it seems like there's no major safety issues with use of chemical Sun scens but it's certainly something that occasionally comes to mind when deciding what type of sunscreen to use now mineral sunscreens while it can be sometimes a little bit thicker to apply and they may be more likely leave a white cast they do tend to offer better sun protection better UV blocking than chemical sunscreens and because of the fact that they don't have any chemicals in them sometimes people feel that they're safer and we might be more likely to recommend them for children or individuals who are pregnant Beyond just considering whether it's a chemical or a mineral sunscreen there are also tinted sunscreen and these tinted Suns screen iron oxides are used to help give the sunre tent but they also block visible light so espcially for people who have very sun-sensitive skin as what might be seen in rosacea having a tinted sunscreen can be helpful to block the visible light in addition to the UV radiation the next feature of sunre to consider is the vehicle or what it's mixed into these can range from lightweight gels to thicker lotions and creams for those who are looking for something that feels lighter on the skin that rubs an easier or who have more oily skin a gel sunscreen might be something to consider these also sometimes can be less likely to leave a white cast for those those who have dry or more sensitive skin a lotion or a cream sunscreen might be a better choice before we dive into active ingredients and sunscreens if you found this video

sometimes help with redness as well and it can be a little bit calming for the skin however for some niacinamide can also be irritating so if someone's having a lot of irritation or dryness or finding their sunscreen just bothering their skin it's worth considering if niacinamide might be the culprit and it might be worth avoiding niacinamide sunscreen in that case for those with drier skin or who are just having issues with the Skin Barrier which can commonly be seen in acne and rosacea it's important to look for sunscreens that have hydrating ingredients in them that can help repair that Skin Barrier like hyaluronic acid or like camiz these ingredients are becoming more and more common in sunscreens and they can be very helpful for people with acne and rosacea prone skin so the summarize what we've discussed so far there is no such thing as a perfect or best sunscreen a sunscreen is going to depend on an IND individual's goals needs and budget for someone with drier skin a sunscreen that has hydrating components like hyaluronic acid or ceramides would be good to look for for someone who's still struggling with breakouts consider having a sunscreen that has niacinamide in it it's going to be able to help with those redness and bumps for someone who has more sensitive scan or rosacea prone scan it might be good to look for a mineral sunscreen that has few chemicals or preservatives in it for someone who's looking to avoid a white cast a chemical SC screen and the gel formulation might be the way to go ultimately trust how your skin feels if a sunscreen's affordable feels good on your skin and is from a common and reputable brand it's probably a good option thanks for watching although I did say that I wasn't going to recommend any products in case it's helpful I did put a list of some of my current favorite sunscreens down below I don't have any conflicts of interest with any of these brands or products I just wanted to share them in case they're a helpful

        "transcript": "if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you're probably having a hard time coming with a skincare regimen or finding skincare products that are effective for you well today in this video we're going to discuss rosacea and I'm going to give you over-the-counter skincare that can help stay tuned till the end because I will make a skincare regimen for your rosacea skin type with actual product recommendations so my name is Dr Swati Canon and I'm a board certified dermatologist out here in California thank you so much for watching this video and welcome to my channel what is rosacea rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness flushing sometimes pimple like bumps on your cheeks your nose your chin as well as textural changes of the nose chin and forehead even various triggers can flare or worsen rosacea and some of these common triggers include alcohol spicy foods sun exposure even stress and I know stress can worsen really anything but stress definitely can worsen rosacea as well as certain histamine-rich foods like tomatoes avocados certain skincare products can also rest in rosacea so there are a lot of triggers for rosacea and a lot of people don't really know what their triggers are so I recommend sometimes keeping a diary so you can know like hey I had red wine and now I have redness and flushing and all the rosacea symptoms or I had an avocado toast yesterday and now my rosacea is worse so keeping a diary can help with noticing what your triggers are but you know it is annoying to keep a diary so I get it rosacea can also affect really any ethnicity and any gender but it is more common in middle-aged Caucasian men and women unfortunately rosacea is chronic like a lot of our inflammatory conditions and there is no cure there are different types of rosacea so we have categorized them into different subsets the first type is called erythamato telangiotatic rosacea I know I don't know why dermatologists have such long words but this type of rosacea is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels or dilated blood vessels on the skin the second type is called Popular are popular postular rosacea and this is when you get pimple like bumps kind of in the middle of your face often acne and popular puscular rosacea can go together so they can be seen together the third type is called fiberous rosacea and this is when you get a thickening of skin or like a bulbous appearance on your nose and finally there's also ocular rosacea this is rosacea affecting the eyes causing redness tearing itching and sometimes vision problems now these categories are actually kind of fluid and changing there is an overlap between all of these categories so you can have you know erythematode rosacea and popular puscular rosacea so there's a lot of overlap but it just kind of helps to Define and gives us guidelines for treatment this video is going to focus on redness and the pimple form of rosacea and how to calm down the Baseline inflammation in rosacea patients thymus and ocular rosacea there is not really any over-the-counter treatment that helps for that so those require prescription or in-office treatments what are the best in ingredients for rosacea the main thing for rosacea patients is to use anti-inflammatory and hydrating ingredients goal is to have a simple yet effective skin care regimen that decreases the inflammation and doesn't cause irritation so you don't want to overuse skin care products the first ingredient for rosacea that I really love is azolic acid we've talked about azelaic acid a lot on my channel and even in my previous video that gave you ingredients for discoloration as a lake acid is one of them so it is one of the best ingredients for acne for rosacea for skin lightening it is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial meaning that it decreases some of the bacteria that play a role in rosacea over the counter you can find 10 azelic acid and we also give prescription strength which is 15 or 20 percent acetylic acid it's best to use acelic acid at night time most rosacea patients are not going to be able to tolerate a retinoid so you're going to use azelic acid instead the next ingredient for rosacea patients is niacinamide and this is a form of vitamin B3 and again I have talked about it a lot nice and mind is in a lot of skincare products especially in moisturizers it's helpful for redness it is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for hydration it also regulates oil production it reduces the appearance of pores so it's really an overall great ingredient for rosacea patients who also have probably all these other issues I don't recommend using niacinamide above five percent I recommend staying under five percent so notorium has a five percent niacinamide gel that you can try also a lot of moisturizers sunscreens they do have niacinamide so you don't have to use niacinamide separately I actually recommend using niacinamide in a moisturizer or in a sunscreen versus by itself tranexamic acid is the other ingredient for rosacea I definitely have it in my previous video where I talk about how helpful it is for hyperpigmentation and melasma it is also so helpful for rosacea because we now know that txa regulates blood vessel formation excessive blood vessel formation and dilation of blood vessels is what causes the redness and the flushing in rosacea patients and so when we can regulate it we can really minimize the appearance of redness txa is also very gentle so it is very well tolerated by most rosacea patients the one that I like is the notorium tranexamic acid serum this contains five percent tranexamic acid and niacinamide plus kojic acid it's helpful for lightning and for rosacea the next ingredient for rosacea is sodium sulfacedamide plus sulfur so sodium sulfacetamide is an anti-inflammatory skincare ingredient but this is often a prescription and it's really hard to find it over the counter however you can find sulfur soaps over the counter and sulfur is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial and that's kind of how it helps rosacea it is incredibly stinky sulfur smells like rotten eggs so some people just can't tolerate the smell of it but sulfur also helps with acne it helps with dandruff called cyborg dermatitis there's a lot of uses for this ingredient so just to clear up any confusion the first ingredient I talked about was sodium sulfacetamide and this can come as a face wash but it's hard to find it over the counter it's usually a prescription we combine sodium sulfacinamide with sulfur and that combination is very good for rosacea but you can also just find sulfur alone as a soap and this is what's usually found over the counter and sulfur alone has some of these properties that I just talked about the next ingredient for rosacea is using ceramides so ceramides are emollients that I've spoken about in the moisturizer video before and ceramides repair the Skin Barrier and they help to hydrate the skin so for rosacea patients it's incredibly important to maintain your skin barrier to protect that Skin Barrier so that you don't get too much irritation I like products like Ulta MD or CeraVe that make moisturizers and sunscreen with ceramides and niacinamide glycerin is another really great humectant for rosacea patients because glycerin is such a powerful hydrating ingredient so it really draws in that water to help moisturize your skin the next ingredient for rosacea is called acetyl tetrapeptide 40. so remember in my peptide video and I don't know if you guys watched it if you haven't watched watch my peptide video please go check it out but in my peptide video I talked about certain peptides that are anti-inflammatory an acetyl Tetra peptide 40 is an anti-inflammatory peptide that can be very helpful for rosacea it helps to reduce inflammation as well as redness it also helps to maintain the Skin Barrier and to protect the Skin Barrier function there are also other peptides that can be anti-inflammatory in fact Paula's Choice peptide booster has multiple peptides several of which are anti-inflammatory and can be very helpful for redness and rosacea patients by the way if you're enjoying and learning from this video please hit the Thumbs Up Button And subscribe to my channel and please also share this video with others who would find it helpful I am trying to grow my channel in 2023 so I am very grateful to all of you who are watching commenting and interacting with my content another really great rosacea ingredient is called and I'm gonna butcher this Camila Camila sinensis anyway this is green tea leaf extract so green tea leaf extract is really helpful for rosacea green tea as we know is very anti-inflammatory it's a very powerful antioxidant and it is used in skincare sometimes especially for rosacea skin another ingredient that I'm going to butcher is called Santa Nella asiatica definitely can't pronounce that but we're going to continue so Santa Nella asiatica in India we actually have this ingredient as well but we call it go to kala and it has many many benefits I actually remember taking gotu kala when I was little for colds it is a powerful antioxidant it is anti-inflammatory and it also helps a lot for inflammation with rosacea patients so it has become a lot more popular in America and it's become a lot more popular in skincare recently in the last few years so beauty of joseon is a Korean skincare brand that actually has a serum that contains a green tea leaf extract Centinela asiatica and vitamin B5 so it's very calming it's hydrating and it's also fragrance free so for rosacea patients that's like a winner have you guys tried Korean skincare products and Korean sunscreens if so please let me know and comment below I really love how Koreans approach skincare with their hydrating and calming ingredients so I think I'm definitely gonna make a YouTube video about it soon but let me know what Korean skincare products you have tried so that I can also look into them Dr jart psychopair tiger grass serum tiger grass or pear serum this has Centinela asiatica and niacinamide it also has like a greenish tint so you can use it in the morning because the green tip helps to cover redness and then it's anti-inflammatory for the actual rosacea component Dr jart sick a pear stick a player is it sick of pear or a single player crap sometimes like I cannot remember these names but this particular line of product also has a moisturizer with similar ingredients that is very common for rosacea patients so you can either use it in a serum or as a moisturizer burrito Centinela green level safe SPF 50 p8 plus plus this isn't a really great sunscreen by the way for rosacea and acne important patients because it contains Centinela asiatica niacinamide vitamin E is an SPF 50. so I really do like this sunscreen fertilization patients and if you've tried it let me know the other sunscreens I normally like for rosacea patients I tend to like sunscreens with zinc oxide so which is a physical sunscreen and I like physical sunscreens over chemical sunscreens because sometimes chemical sunscreens can worsen or trigger rosacea but there are certain chemical sunscreen formulations that are okay that are more well tolerated and one of them is the Ulta MD UV clear and I recommend this for a lot of different patients but it's a really great sunscreen with SPF 46 it contains niacinamide and it's very well tolerated a La Roche Posay also makes various sunscreens for rosacea patients and these are also pretty well tolerated so not all chemical sunscreens are going to flare your rosacea in general I do prefer physical sunscreens but some chemical formulations are okay by the way let's clear up differences between sensitive skin rosacea and having allergies or rashes to certain skin care products so some sensitive skin that's a broad category of patients that just means that you can't tolerate skin care more readily this includes your rosacea patients but you can also have sensitive skin without having rosacea sensitive skin means you're more likely to get rashes or irritation or acne more easily so it's really a broad category that includes various skin types rosacea is what I just said earlier where you have dilated blood vessels and can be characterized by flushing or pimple like bumps this is different than people who get an allergic or contact dermatitis or a rash from exposure to certain ingredients and skin care products or to even certain metals or to other types of preservatives so the most common example of contact dermatitis is nickel dermatitis and dermatitis by the way just means inflammation of the skin so that's a very non-specific term but nickel dermatitis you might have seen this is when patients or when people get a rash around their belly button because of coming into contact with the nickel and the button and the pants or the jeans so if you you tend to get contact dermatitis a common way to test for this at home is you can apply skincare product on your forearm for one to six weeks and see if you get any rashes or irritation if not you can then try the product on your face now this by the way this test the forearm test doesn't work for rosacea patients so rosacea patients it's very hard to see for skincare products can help you or harm you until you try but for rosacea patients what you can do is just try on the side of your face and see if you if you get a flare what are my ingredients to avoid in rosacea skin salicylic acid is one ingredient to avoid even if you have acne and rosacea so I know we commonly use salicylic acid for acne it is anti-inflammatory but it is also so irritating that we don't really recommend it for rosacea patients and this is a similar concept for benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide also is anti-inflammatory we also use it for acne but I don't always recommend it for rosacea patients because they can be irritating perhaps in low percentages it would be okay we just have other ingredients that we can use so we don't have to use these and this is the same for glycolic acid which is a type of chemical exfoliating acid because it's irritating or it can be irritating I also don't recommend it for rosacea now on the flip side polyhydroxy acids which are like a newer type of exfoliating acid they can be helpful for rosacea because they are less irritating they are more gentle and they can be anti-inflammatory so some rosacea patients can try polyhydroxy acids by the way not everyone needs to exfoliate so your skin naturally exfoliates on its own you don't have to use a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid or polyhydroxy acid to help exfoliate so don't feel the need to do so other ingredients like witch hazel Menthol camphor those all cause tingling that doesn't mean by the way it's working but they're all kind of these tingling irritating ingredients and I don't recommend them for rosacea other astringents or toners that contain alcohol or heavy content of alcohol definitely avoid this if you have rosacea because it can be so drying on the other hand though rose water toner can be helpful because rose water is coming and I actually made this video it talks about at home remedies for skin hair and nails if you're interested you can definitely go check it out fragrance if you see that on the label that could potentially also be irritating for rosacea so I would be mindful about it but by the way when you're looking at fragrance and alcohol you know you have to also see where it is on the ingredient list so if alcohol is like the sixth or seventh ingredient in the ingredient list it's probably gonna be okay and it's not going to dehydrate your skin that much but if it's in the top three ingredients then that means that that skin care product has too much alcohol and could potentially dehydrate your skin so retinoids I mean they are really an anti-aging Powerhouse but they can definitely trigger and flare rosacea so you do have to be careful I don't think retinoids are completely off limits for rosacea patients it really depends on how severe your rosacea is and what your triggers for rosacea are you know you just want to be careful so if you're going to want to use retinoids and you have rosacea you want to start very gentle gentle retinoids and then slowly increase their use as tolerated so to learn how to incorporate retinoids you can actually watch one of my first YouTube videos ever on retinoids and it really kind of teaches you how to incorporate a retinoid slowly into your skincare regimen some good options for retinoids in rosacea patients include this Keels Retinol Serum it's ceramides and peptides so this one contains retinol which is a gentler former for retinoid also and it contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides and peptides so start this one slowly but it is a good option for rosacea patients of course if you see an irritation or you see flaring of your rosacea stop any of these skincare products immediately the other good one for rosacea patients is the ordinary Grand active retinol Emulsion brand active retinol is a much gentler type of retinoid so it's really great for rosacea and sensitive skin types and this one also contains squalene invisible law which are ingredients that help with inflammation and hydration and it doesn't contain the shark squalene but the vegan version of squalene now how would you combine all of these ingredients for a skincare regimen in the morning you can use a gentle cleanser so you can actually use the sulfur wash or a prescription sodium sulfacetamide wash like I talked about earlier or you can just use a gentle cleanser like the La Roche Posay tolerain hydrating gentle cleanser or CeraVe gentle cleanser after you clean your face you can use one of the green tea serums like the beauty of joseon green tea serum or the Dr jarts like a pear serum followed by a moisturizer and then sunscreen on top so your moisturizer recommendations include like the Dr jarts like a pear moisturizer or a banana cream moisturizer or a CeraVe moisturizer really anything that's gentle and contains ceramides is a good moisturizer for rosacea patients and you would then follow this up by a sunscreen like the Alta MD UV clear sunscreen which also contains ceramides and niacinamide at night time you can again clean your your face and make sure you use a gentle cleanser to wash off even the makeup of your face you can then use a gentle retinoid like the Kiehl's Retinol Serum or you can use acelaic acid at night time so if you're going to use salicylic acid you can actually use it every single night as long as you don't get irritation but if you want to start a retinoid then you can use a retinoid twice a week and use azelic acid on the other night you would then follow this up with a moisturizer as well and some good moisturizer for rosacea patients include Ulta mdpm therapy or that Dr jart sickle player moisturizer that I talked about earlier on a side note if you do wear makeup and heavily tinted sunscreens and you have rosacea I still recommend that you double cleanse so you can watch this video on double cleansing to learn how to do it well for rosacea patients I don't want you to use any cleansers that strip the moisture off your face so to remove the makeup I recommend the cleansing bombs like the pharmacy Green Clean cleansing balm which is very hydrating and then you would follow the cleansing balm with a gentle cleanser an alternate skin care regimen would be this so in the morning you would cleanse like I talked about above you can then use a vitamin C serum and we'll talk about that soon followed by a moisturizer and then Alta you know the Alta MD sunscreen at night time again you can double cleanse use your azelaic acid and then a niacinamide moisturizer so as you notice I did mention vitamin C even if you have rosacea and vitamin C can really help with rosacea because it is anti-inflammatory and so it can help with some of the flares that rosacea patients have however certain forms of vitamin C and high concentrations of vitamin C can also flare rosacea so if you want to learn how to use vitamin C and you have rosacea make sure to check out this video that I have on vitamin C where I give vitamin C recommendations for rosacea patients and you can learn how to use it in your skincare regimen so thank you so much for

        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "I have a love for Australian sunscreens and naked Sundays is no exception you knew how to get it when I saw it at Target it's actually cheaper at Target than it is online and I have a dupe for this actually kind of this sunscreen does oxidize to a really pretty and unique Rosy beige color this is a fully mineral tinted sunscreen which are best for hyperpigmentation and sensitive skin but I can see why people find this too suffocating for everyday use it's waterresistant and very thick and it doesn't take well to powder it's made for glow but I find versatile sunscreens are key since I take into consideration those looking for a and done sunscreen I think this will suit all skin types as it's a beautiful glow that doesn't look greasy which is so rare for mineral sunscreens due to how opaque they are it does work best on moisturized skin and it does look noticeable in peach fuzz I did shave my peach fuzz once and it looked absolutely amazing but I don't want to do that again so instead I wait about 20 minutes until it's settled and rub it in once more that seems to do the trick into not making my peach fuzz look noticeable it does tend to look thick by the end of the day and it does transfer easily I prefer to use those on my face and when my hair is up overall I really like this and I highly recommend to those with Ros Asia",

        "transcript": "good morning my little nerds I'm Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to Saturday morning Pillow Talk Durham where we are going to do today a full comprehensive Roundup of sunscreens kicking summer off next weekend and I see you I see you you're gonna slide into my DMs with a really bad sunburn and ask me how do I take care of this I am here to help prevent that from happening before I jump in like the video subscribe to the channel comment below let me know if you have any questions number one rule with sunscreen is not is chemical better is physical better which one is safer which one is best for me the best sunscreen for you is the one that you're actually going to use every single day rain or shine because I'm a cosmetic dermatologist I make my living from reversing the sun damage from getting rid of the sunspots you don't like from doing laser treatments and I'm here to tell you if you want to save yourself a lot of money and headache down the road I.E if you do not want to pay me down the road start wearing sunscreen on the regular today because this is what's going to help protect your skin and protect your bum down the road and not to mention the c word skin cancer has been directly correlated with sun exposure and believe it or not it's not even those who get consistently burned on the regular it's even the ones who have these sporadic irregular really bad Burns every summer that are probably even at highest risk so let's jump in best sunscreens for dry skin starting with my baby I love this one the beauty of joshon this is a very silky slippy sunscreen that retails for believe it or not 10 bucks it is a hybrid of a physical and a chemical to this day I'm not sure how stylevana gets them to get to the U.S but I am going to take advantage of that loophole because this Korean sunscreen is unbelievable she's fragrance free she's 30 rice extract and she's lightweight non-greasy absolutely love of it easy to use every single day and easy to layer on top of moisturizer the other one that I really do like is perritos daily go-to sunscreen SPF 50. it's also a hybrid fragrance free this one has a much more sheer finish as you can tell over here and I'm going to just rub that in over here and you guys can see it's really sheer it's really easy to layer over a moisturizer quick side note as you're going from the winter months which are usually dry with the heaters on to the summer months which are usually hotter and more humid you can tailor your moisturizer if you're someone who's very dry layering these two sunscreens on top of a moisturizer is great and that's why you want to keep a moisturizer but if you are somebody who's very oily right you can maybe even skip the moisturizer all together and the sunscreen that I would recommend for oily skin is the large double repair face moisturizer counterintuitive because I actually really love this one for the winter time especially for people with dry skin who are also moisturizing because it's slightly heavier than these ones but if you have oily skin you can skip the moisturizer all together and just use this in the summer and you're going to be golden the double repair face moisturizer is broad spectrum SPF 30 it retails for 20 bucks it is a chemical sunscreen it's also relatively deceiving in that it appears lightweight but it is loaded with ceramides to help restore your Skin Barrier and give you that extra Sheen that you need if you're oily again you can skip your morning moisturizer you do not need to moisturize in the summertime when it's hot and humid and this is all you need to help replenish your barrier and to protect your skin in the process so she is kind of a chameleon if YouTube blocks me for singing that song it's the end of everyone because that's the worst rendition of that song but chameleon for oil really to dry skin in the winter and dry skin to oily skin in the Sun going on to our sensitive soles out there we have three in the lineup Dr jart is the first one with every Sunday mineral sunscreen at SPF 50. this one is for 50 it is a weightless water resistant SPF but water resistant means nothing to me because even though it can last longer through water usage and water sports I still reapply this very regularly if I am at the beach or at the pool don't be so misled with the false sense of security that it's water resistant and it's going to last throughout the day it will not and you do need to constantly reapply especially if you jump into the pool and it's less than two hours apart SkinCeuticals is a tried and true you have to shake this baby up your physical Fusion UV defense is their broad spectrum SPF at 36 it is titanium and zinc I actually take their tinted version in I like it more than their white one because I do feel like it leaves less of a cast behind it's not great for every skin tone unfortunately but that's the problem with zinc and titanium it's very hard to create a physical blocker that I'm like pale as anything and it gives me a little bit of a color and last vanicream this brand is a great brand if you have sensitive skin now what you're going to notice is that they are very proud of their free of dyes fragrance masking fragrance lanolin parabens formaldehyde releasers but this doesn't come from a place of fear-mongering people who have sensitive skin tend to get very sensitive to certain ingredients and these are usually the biggest culprits and that's why these products are free of those ingredients it doesn't mean that it's a clean brand it doesn't mean that they're trying to like hopefully not play into the fear-mongering and again I have no shares I'm not sponsored by them but this is a great brand if you are sensitive it is a combination of zinc it's actually the zinc oxide and it has ceramides as well it is relatively lightweight and not necessarily the best when it comes to a cast or in terms of Elegance but again if you are very sensitive this is a very safe option and safe bags on anti aging anti-aging is din isden is a Spanish brand this is their erythema actinica daily SPF 50 that retails for 60 bucks she also needs to be shaken and not stirred and it is a zinc oxide just to show you guys it's also very watery kind of like the SkinCeuticals but the reason why this one is better for anti-aging purposes is because it is formulated it was a proprietary patented DNA repairasomes which help to prove repair existing sun damage so if you have a lot of pre-cancerous lesions also known as actinic keratoses or a lot of sun damage on your face this is not only protecting but is being proactive in helping you fix your skin in the process so love is done for that now we're going to switch gears into skin tones now unfortunately for skin tones when it comes to sunscreens and comes to Mineral sunscreens so things with zinc and titanium it is very hard to find one that doesn't the cast if you are somebody who is darker and you're not sensitive I will tell you go get the beauty of joshon this is a great easy one I think it will definitely melt into your skin it is very very elegant and very very easy or even double repair these are great sunscreens that are chemical sunscreens that will melt into your skin without leaving a cast but if you are somebody who is a darker skin tone and you have sensitive skin the ones that I have seen that have been the best from my patients Peter Thomas Roth has a mineral sunscreen patients have told me that they've had very good outcomes with this particular mineral sunscreen and darker skin types I will also say that the touch-ups their silk sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 50 is a zinc oxide sunscreen it is broad spectrum it is a mineral sunscreen that works great in all skin tones per my patients especially my Indian patients I also it's very liquidy it does blend in rather seamlessly and they've done a really nice job in the formulations I hate the packaging I hate how thin it is I hate it doesn't understand it's flimsy but for 60 bucks it could have been better in terms of like not being so cheap and peeling off that's my own thing with it it has a it has ha so if you're trying to limit how much hyaluronic acid you're using in your skincare routine this one has it in it it doesn't bother me so much because it's only in one product if you end up using it but you don't need a h a serum you definitely do not need the NHA serum going into summer please you don't live tinted is another brand at SPF 30 and 32 dollars it is a zinc oxide I tried this one on Tiffany who works with me and she's Guyanese and I will say that she thought it was really nice but it does leave a slightly orange Hue to the Skin So if you're very dark I would probably not go for this one go for the touch or go for the Peter Thomas Roth otherwise this one has some really nice reviews online now for under makeup for all the makeup wearers out there let's talk about what kind of sunscreen to use underneath your makeup you can absolutely use the sunscreens that we've talked about no problem at all but if you're looking for a little je ne sais quoi what I sometimes like to do is take super goop's glow screen and lightly Pat it to the highlights and high bones high cheekbones of my face it is 36 it's a chemical sunscreen I don't use too much of it because I would have already used the other sunscreen and because it is a chemical sunscreen my eyes are sensitive if I get it in my eyes it's like Watershed terrible for everyone I had it happen to me one time while driving and I had to pull over because I couldn't see so that was a scary moment so I've learned to just kind of use it you know what on the high points of my face to give my skin that extra glowy Sheen because it's pretty but I do have sunscreen underneath so that's how I use the super goop glue screen other people can use it all over their face and I'm envious but I can't because of the sensitivity of my eyes if you're looking for a sunscreen that can kind of do two things act like a makeup while still giving you the protection that you need the only caveat that I have if you're going to do this is use the right amount I will say that that is what I do especially in the winter time when I am really not outside and I go from the apartment to the office before the sun is out and I go home once the sun is down but I love Laura Mercier this one has been a godsend to me it is their Tinted Moisturizer but they recently came out with an Illuminating one which I much prefer to the Tinted Moisturizer and it gives you that little glow obviously I have a little bit more of a glow because of the glow screen but it's just enough where you don't feel like it's overpowering I use two full finger lengths one on each face and then I just kind of dab it all into my face very evenly it is a chemical sunscreen it retails for 48 bucks I do not wear Foundation when I wear this I just literally but that's what I have on my face right now and it comes in 20 Shades it is no makeup makeup really nice for every day the other one that I've never tried I'm very transparent just bought because of all of you guys is cosas I love their little packaging I like that it's small it's slightly wider than touch us so it does hold better it is a nerd pick from last week this one retails for 40 bucks it's the dream beam sunscreen it's a mineral sunscreen with 21 Nano non-nano zinc oxide peptide ceramides and H A as well I mean if you're gonna make a brand new sunscreen just can somebody not promote hyaluronic acid please but anyway it's a new sunscreen I'm going to test it out right now for all of you guys this is the actual consistency of it it feels very soft and smooth and when it goes on I don't know how good this is going to be for darker skin types but on my skin tone it goes on relatively seamlessly has a little bit of a yellowish Hue to it but worth a try it is one that all of you nerds have requested that I speak of I will say it is definitely worth a try I'm gonna take it home this weekend and try using it so now that we've covered all sunscreens from here to here even though very honestly I do go down to here every single day it's time to move on to the body the body can be tricky because people sometimes overlook this completely and only remember it when they go to the beach I am guilty of that because very honestly I don't wear body sunscreen every single day I'm covered in sweaters and I'm hardly outside but if you're running errands if you're wearing tank tops if you're wearing t-shirts and you are out and about definitely make sure to cover your arms and go down to your tits because that is where a lot of the damage happens and it will get creepy over time supergoop has their play sunscreen is the chemical sunscreen if you have sensitive eyes and you get this in your eyes it will burn so that is why I love it for my kids I don't necessarily love it for me because my eye situation I love one by color science I don't have it here it is a mineral sunscreen for the body which is relatively rare to find but it is a really nice one and it comes in different shades as well they also have a bronzed version so if you're at the beach and you want to feel like a bronze statue the color science bronzed body sunscreen is an interesting one to go for the one that people love ly really do like as well is glow which is SP ef50 it is 15 to 20 bucks it is also Tiffany's favorite sunscreen and it doubles as her body Shimmer as well so why not protect your skin and look good in the process I'm all for it this one is water resistant up to 80 minutes but again you're gonna have to reapply if you jump in the water they also have which is interesting a spray don't use this for your face but if you want to reapply sprays are a great way to reapply for the body you're going to need much more than you think A good rule of thumb is if the floor is relatively slippery you're probably good and you've applied enough okay but don't think that one little Spritz is going to give you all the cover that you need in terms of scalp sunscreens a lot of people do not have the density of hair on their scalp and they need to protect their scalps you can wear a hat of course but if you're somebody who doesn't like to wear hats SPF powders are a great way to go super goop this is their resetting mineral powder SPF 35 it is one that I do like also if I do not want to wash my hair it acts like a dry shampoo to a certain extent if you need to get some in your scalp I would go for the super goop powder there's also one by Sun Bum which I do not have here but when I tell you it transports me and takes me away to a tropical island you will feel the same way too love love love the Sun Bum scalp and hair Mist SPF 30. it is only 17 and the cheapest vacation you will ever take in your brain talking about reapplication this is also a great option to reapply if you're out and about in the city and in the summertime it's also good to help blot any excess Sheen that you get from being overly sweaty it comes in four Shades translucent light medium and deep which might also work for hair tones as well it is a 24 zinc oxide retails for 30 bucks I like how they comes with this so you you can actually uncap it completely and you can just buy the powders and save the brush just make sure you clean your brush between uses because that can just become very unsanitary there's a body reapplication we gently touched on the Coppertone glow Shimmer but if you're looking for a Mist that is also a mineral based Mist for your body Alta MD has your UV aox Mist which I actually love because it is white so you see exactly and I will show you guys where you are applying it it's a little bit hard to with the cap if I'm being very transparent but it's white so you can totally see where you're actually applying it so there's no mist areas there's no false sense of security you can really truly see if you have a nice even coating all over your body and then it can get rubbed in answer to my surprise it rubs in relatively elegantly where there's not a crazy crazy white cast left behind so I love it side tip never spray a spray sunscreen on your face you don't want to inhale it so you want to make sure that you spray it on your palms of your hands and then go to work now for kiddos call me evil I want them to look like ghosts I don't care what skin tone they are I want to see the sunscreen on them to know that their skin is protected so that they can thank me later on in life but I don't care and you know what they can speak to their therapist about it in 30 years but think baby is as minerally unelegant as it gets and this one makes you looking like a ghost it's really hard to rub this one in I'm not trying to sell this for any sort of elegant situation but if you want your kids to have a really high bill with a therapist when they're older but beautiful skin think baby is the way to go I think no pun intended it's SPF 50 it is 20 zinc oxide and it is great for little ones if your baby's less than six months old the American Academy of Pediatricians do not really recommend that kids under six months use sunscreen I hope to God you're not putting a little baby underneath the sun anyway and that you're protecting their skin with UPF clothing hats even sunglasses with UV filters to protect their very sensitive eyes because there's still a little small so anyway that is that that is the Sun screen Roundup I had my Kleenex ready today I hope you guys learned something in this video and that this video is going to be super helpful for you all the products will be linked below and I will see you guys next
