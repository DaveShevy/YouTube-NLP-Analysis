        "published_at": "2023-03-30T13:00:19Z",
        "transcript": "now if there's one thing I know about it's redness and a tendency to rosacea and I have learned that the most important thing are my daily habits when it comes to managing my skin now any redness or rosacea sufferer will know that the wrong skin care habits can really be one of the biggest triggers around and that's why it's so important to put together the right supportive skin care routine with the right actives to manage your skin I truly believe that azelaic acid takes pride of place when building an effective redness solution skin care plan so azelic acid is brilliant in redness prone skin and rosacea because it changes the way the skin senses the environment so part of the issue with rosacea is that we overreact to things like UV exposure and harsh winds so I've always likened it to the fire alarm in the kitchen going off when the kettle boils rather than when the oven is on fire the same thing is true for our skin in rosacea now that's because of something called toll-like receptors and the dial is turned right up so these are over sensitive and they overreact leading to things like vasodilatation so the blood vessels in the skin open up changes in Skin Barrier function flushing and then blemishes so papules and pustules now the great thing about azelaic acid it turns the dial right down products that I recommend that contain azelic acid include the inculus 10 percent acetic acid serum the ordinary is the original 10 azoic acid suspension and Flawless brightly serum which has also got 10 azelic acid in combination with three other actives the next active ingredient I think is worth considering is niacinamide now this barrier loving B vitamin is an asset for two reasons firstly it does make the Skin Barrier that bit stronger and more resilient and we know that decreased barrier function is part of the reason why rosacea prone skin behaves so sensitively so that's because of increased ceramide production bolstering your Skin's barrier function and then secondly it's anti-inflammatory and we know triggers in down of why niacinamide is so helpful I think many of us saw this at first hand during the pandemic when wearing masks not only aggravated acne but also tended to aggravate rosacea and niacinamide was a real hero ingredient in that context now products that contain niacinamide include the garden of wisdom's five percent niacinamide serum or as I mentioned Flawless brightly serum also contains niacinamide with azureic acid for ease now the next ingredient I want you to think about for treating redness prone skin might not seem like an active but to me it is and that's physical sunscreen I have patients genuinely appreciate the value of mineral sunscreen and actually improving their rosacea and redness you know are separate to the benefits that they achieve from their actives and I think it's that important because at the end of the day most of the people affected by rosacea tend to have light skin and light eyes and we know they're at risk of premature aging and possibly uncontrolled inflammation might accelerate that so we want to protect the dermis as much as possible so daily sunscreen is a non-negotiable the other thing is that physical sunscreen can often just make the skin look better it has light reflecting properties and if tinted can really give a nice evening out of the skin tone which on good skin days can often mean you can get away with just using concealer personally I cannot live without a lightly tinted sunscreen I'm a Flawless gossamer tint one addict as many of you will know but finding that minerals sunscreen that makes you feel confident even on a day when your Skin's a little on the pink side is a real godsend now introducing a retinoid into redness prone skin or indeed rosacea can seem risky idea after all they're associated with irritation and potentially dryness and scaling however when redness prone skin is calm or your rosaceous in the maintenance phase they actually have quite a lot to offer so firstly they may actually improve the tendency for abnormal red blood vessels to appear so the development of those fixed broken capillaries that we associate with redness prone skin secondly they have a role in re-densifying the dermis so after all we know that those with light skin and light eyes are more at risk of rosacea they're also more at risk of premature aging and we really want all that collagen and elastin hyaluronic acid the structure of proteins that make the skin thick firm and resilient so I'm a big fan of retinoids introduced in the right way at the right time and in the over-the-counter space I think when acts of retinoid has to be one of the best ways to do this in a gentle and reassuring fashion products you can try include the inky list Gran active retinoid the skin rocks retinoid one or Flawless nightly serum if you want to try your retinoid in combination with azelaic acid and niacinamide one more skin care consideration for you is Ivermectin now this is available on prescription hence I'm mentioning it last but it is something to think about if you are getting frequent flare-ups with papules and pustules and redness now in rosacea redness comes about for a number of reasons firstly those broken capillaries can lead to a permanent redness in the cheeks typically but also in the nose and the chin now the blemishes of rosacea can also leave redness behind so post-inflammatory pigmentation can create redness on the skin so as a separate way in which the skin can Redden and then the Third Way is simply through barrier just function that can lend itself to the skin becoming irritating now for me azaleaic acid is excellent at down down the inflammation making the skin look less pink and then Ivermectin or cilantro as it's known on prescription helps to reduce the incidence of those papules in pustules so it is really helpful for an inflammatory flare-up of your rosacea now I tend to use cilantro for inflammatory bursts and then I will plan to wean someone off that onto azulaic acid for maintenance and then I'll just reuse it as often as is needed to help the patient control their flares the good thing about ongoing use of azulaic acid is that over time I find that you get fewer and fewer flare-ups and you get better and better control and in addition to that you also get the nice skin conditioning benefits you get improved texture you get better looking pores and an overall brighter appearance to the skin whilst also helping them achieve the best possible complexion they can so as I've discovered it is really worthwhile having a long-term plan when it comes to a Rosy complexion because unfortunately it does tend to hang around as a tendency however putting in the right groundwork using the right products can lend themselves to improving your skin immeasurably whilst also controlling your redness so it's work that's worthwhile and I hope you find the recommendations in today's video is helpful so if I've convinced you that azaleaic acid is right for you might want to watch My ultimate beginner's guide to using azaleaic acid to give you a foolproof plan for getting started I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you again soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry a family physician and in this short video let's talk about the rosacea diet and how to reverse the redness associated with rosacea the redness the scaling the blood vessels are embarrassing over 400 million people on the planet suffer from rosacea and I have a secret to tell you later in this video that you might not believe what if I told you that the cause of your rosacea is not some of the triggers you've been told about but it's actually your diet it's what you've been eating and it's what you've not been eating that's what's causing your rosacea that's what this video is all about now if you know someone suffering from rosacea please take a second and share this video with them so that they will know there is hope and there is a solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at the end of this video watch that playlist and learn how to do Kido right Kido is cheap Kido is easy Kido is very safe very natural it's very nutritious and it's very delicious and it's going to help your rosacea get better than you ever dreamed it would be and then you can save your money that you've been wasting on co-pays with the pills and the gels and the creams and the lotions because you won't need those anymore now everyone who's already reversed their rosacea with a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet I need you to do me a favor in the comments below I need you to tell your story

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds I'm Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to Pillow Talk durm where we meet every Saturday morning to expand your brain and mind in the process if you have no idea who I am subscribe so you know what's good for you but I am a board certified dermatologist and today we are going to be focusing on rosacea because it is the last weekend of rosacea awareness month and I've taken pity on you flushed red human beings out there so we're going to focus on how to better identify your rosacea and help yourself but before I do that make sure you head on over to d r ris.com because I am starting a new newsletter that's going out every week that is purely educational focused from Dr eris.com so we'll be recapping some of the YouTubes we'll be focusing on new topics if you guys have questions make sure to email us at hello.com and we will make sure to incorporate those questions into that newsletter every week so head on over there I will link it below on the screen so back to rosacea what is it what causes it how do you identify it we're going to get in right now rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition it is not acne and I have to start off by saying this because as a Derm I get so annoyed when I see the marketing around ingredients for rosacea as acne but I understand why they do this and I'm going to let you guys in on something take for example sulfur which we're going to talk about in this video in order to get a drug fact label on a sulfur product so you can have a quote unquote medical indication for that ingredient you have to abide by what the FDA sees that ingredient fit for sulfur has traditionally been approved by the FDA for acne so they often write for example on sulfur purpose acne treatment and that's huge for a brand that they can actually say that so they're going to go ahead and run with it but sulfur is traditionally great for rosacea and not necessarily acne so I think in the process the public has gotten confused and started confusing the two and treating rosacea like acne but that is probably the worst thing you can do because it can disrupt your Skin Barrier more and it can inflame your rosacea worse in the process but I wanted you guys to understand this very nuanced thing so that you know as a person that rosacea is truly not acne it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is due to a multitude of different things we actually don't know exactly why you get it we do believe there is a genetic predisposition when you think of Rosa you think of a white person who gets really red but do not assume that darker skin tones can't have rosacea either it is just harder to detect and see but they can absolutely have rosacea too and it's usually due to a multitude of different factors from genetics chronic heat UV exposure a broken Skin Barrier little tiny mites like these called Demodex mites that are just going rampid on your skin we all have them some of us have them a little bit more than others and when they wake up and they're alive they tend to just mess up but deodex mites an overabundance of reactivity in terms of flushing etc etc etc and when you have a little bit of everything The Perfect Storm can show up on your face when you're nervous when you're stressed when you're hot when you're eating spicy foods when you're on a date you name it but there are really if you want to take a step back four main types of rosacea starting with the most common emodal ectatic rosacea Arial means red tantic means blood vessels rosesa is rosesa so when you have somebody who's red with a lot of broken blood vessels all over their face they have one of the most common forms known as the athematic type then you have the one that I think people get confused by that they confuse with adult acne papulo pular rosacea papules and P little red bumps and little tiny bumps all over your face usually along the cheeks the nose maybe a little bit here can sometimes happen along the chin interesting tip and this one's a good one you do not have blackheads in rosacea and with rosacea the nasal labial folds this area is spared so if you're having all of a sudden a breakout right here around your mouth it's probably not rosacea if it affects your nasal laal folds then you have the the third type which is like your old white uncle that you just can't or maybe you love or you just don't really like I don't know maybe I'm projecting but you have Fus rosacea where when you have chronic inflammation right and enlarged sweat glands the skin can appear thicker and your pores can look enlarged and your nose starts to get really distended and honestly deformed over time it can happen to your nose it can happen to your chin it can happen to your forehead that's the Fus type then the fourth type is ocular rosacea which people often Overlook completely but the eyes are usually affected in 50% of rosacea sufferers and what do you get with that you get blefaritis so inflammation along the eyelid margins you can get redness of the white part of your eye you have to take an eye hygiene into consideration but also when your eyes are affected and they're chronically inflamed especially the lid margins you want to calm that inflammation down so you don't f up your eyeballs in the process and have scratches on your corneil so that's usually an oral medication and that's why you shouldn't be scared of going on systemic medications but you should probably also see an opthalmologist and let them know about it so how can you then help yourself first without going into any sort of over-the-counter products or even prescription medications or in office treatments there's lifestyle and the things associated with lifestyle you're not going to like but this is the hard truth hot showers no steam no all of you weirdos love Hot Yoga that Take 5 hours to go in and out to actually do I tried doing it one year and I died no we don't do hot yoga spicy food I mean everything in moderation okay every once in a while it's fine but if you're going to eat like chili peppers with every meal you're going to mess up your Rosa alcohol caffeine chocolate a lot of chocolate can affect stress yes we need to start meditating in the morning certain medications the list goes on and on and on so you really do have to start listening to your skin and understanding how you're reacting to certain triggers whether it is sitting out in the sun or going into a hot yoga room or doing a steam or a sauna etc etc cooking maybe it's a perfect excuse for you not to cook and so you guys get the gist right make it work to your benefit so what are then the top ingredients that we can incorporate into our routine if we have rosacea and we're trying to help ourselves and I'm going to look for things that are calming and soothing that are going to help restore our Skin Barrier that are going to reduce inflam and that are basically Beyond The Gentle basic skin care that we think of when we think of basic sensitive skin like Cal oatmeal panol Etc glycerin we want to look for ingredients that are going to actively help reduce the look of that is the correct way of saying it if you are in the industry because you can't claim that it's reducing inflammation it's helping reduce the look of inflammation and redness number one and this is probably the most popular one on the market that I think a lot of Ros of people know about and look for directly Santella atica Santella atica is known for redness reducing properties anti-inflammatory properties it has atico sdes medas aides and aziatic acid in it which all have anti-inflammatory effects and it reduces the look of inflammation it has been shown also just side note to promote collagen production so and it also has certain antioxidants that can protect the skin from the damage caused by free radicals obviously full disclosure my brand the depuffer why do I love this product if you have rosacea because it is loaded in centella asiatica but it also has arnica and arnica is not one that is traditionally thought of for rosacea but it works like a charm because it helps reduce the redness and calms the inflammation in a synergistic way that your skin looks def flushed within a couple of minutes when done correctly at the right concentration arnica is tricky though because when you guys look for arnica products more often than not they're diluted in a homeopathic fashion this one is purely Brown because it is pure arnica the color that you guys see here this golden hue is due to the high concentration of arnica in this formulation then you have one that a lot of people with rosacea know about Dr jart Dr jart has his tiger grass which is another name for cantella asiatica color correcting treatment it's a mineral sunscreen with zinc and titanium and it has a green tint to it and a more opaque fashion versus this that is going to help neutralize the look of redness because when you're red you want green to block the red we're not going to go into the art of it take an art course that's not my jam although I do like painting number two we have sulfur I hinted at sulfur at the beginning of this video sulfur is going to be marketed as an acne treatment I.E like on this when you see eradicate daily foaming cleanser acne treatment because it has 3% sulfur but it's not really just an acne treatment it's a rosacea treatment why because sulfur helps to minimize inflammation it regulates seen production a lot of people with rosacea have a lot of overproduced seim think of the nose think of the chin and it also helps to minimize inflammation as well it has antimicrobial properties which is helpful right but not the main reason of why it works and it has mild exfoliating properties but it's not going to over strip you and Break Your Skin Barrier worse making your rosacea flare up in the process there's another product by pieter Thomas Roth they have a 10% sulfur clay mask which is much more potent than the cleanser form and then you have one available at your local drugstore called Dela Cruz where you can literally spend a couple of bucks smell like a rotten egg and improve your skin in the process so those are the sulfur products that are high up at number two when it comes to ingredients number three is AAL acid AAL acid is an ingredient that I have a honestly more of a love love relationship with a little bit of a hate because it's not elegant it pills and it messes up a formula when you mix it with other actives at the right% and in order to use aoic acid if you have rosacea you really want to be at 10% or above but above that is prescription and prescription is 15% which is sweet spot and I don't know how the prescription is formulated but it's so elegant finaa is so elegant and I do not get paid by that drug company whatsoever um but it's a 15% prescription on to over the- counter though we have paa choice this is a 10% AIC acid booster I believe um it has a little bit of licorice it does have salicylic acid I don't know the percent of Sal acid in this if you're sensitive or you think your barrier is inflamed beware don't go for it because the Sal acid might mess you up but AIC acid like I said regul Ates your anti-inflammatory properties and antibacterial properties and it helps as an antioxidant as well Dr Sam bunting across the pond in the UK has her Flawless nightly serum which is a 10% aoic acid serum as well it has 5% niacinamide it does have a Ester form of vitamin C at 2% so it's not going to be the active form of vitamin C but it might be a nice one if you are a rosacea sufferer trying to use vitamin see in the morning wanting to get away with some AIC acid I hear beautiful things I started looking into it because of you guys dming me about it so that is hers and then the ordinary this one's great at night when you have nowhere to go and you don't care who you're seeing it is a 10% a acid suspension you do kind of sometimes have to shake it I feel but it appears nice and elegant but it does pill after a while so do not be fooled by the first impression with this it's 11 bucks though so you not really go wrong and then like I said prescription number four hypochlorous acid you guys have started hearing about this all over Instagram Tik Tok YouTube I don't know what else you guys are on I can't keep up with the social media platforms but hypochlorous acid is one that has been used in medicine for decades I actually use it before every cosmetic procedure to clean my patients faces because it has antimicrobial effects and it is gentle so it's not going to over strip their skin like using plain oil isopropyl alcohol or an alcohol wipe it is now available in fancier forms at nicer stores but you can also get it at your local drugstore as a generic this is one that is available at Walgreens it is really not that expensive at all and you can use it every day on your face in the morning and at night if you're somebody who wears a mask for whatever reason at the height of the pandemic I used to spray my mask with hypoc chloris acid to minimize the breakout around the mouth area number five this is one that people don't often think of when they have rosacea a lot of people with rosacea think they have chronically dry skin over here it's always flaking but then when I ask my patients is your skin dry or oily they go it's more oily but it flakes okay it's not dry skin it's not flaking because it's dry it is a yeast living on your skin and you have dandruff of your face a lot of rosacea patients have dandruff of their face around their eyebrows right here in the corners of their nose or even along their eyelid margins and you can even see it sometimes in front of their ears and they need ketoconazol neral shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp that you can use a couple of times a week on your face to keep that yeast at Bay okay um it's an anti-fungal medicine that can help really help your face and I think when that is sort of subsided and you calm the subar dermatitis down you minimize the inflammation associated with it and your redness gets better in the long run so this is something that you're going to have to incorporate throughout the course of your life and you have to figure out the Cadence of how you want to incorporate it the shampoo is not necessarily the best as a face wash because it's not the ideal pH it might be a little bit stripping but if you use it several times periodically maybe twice a week maybe it's four times a week maybe it's once a week I don't know what the right Cadence is for you and you do it in the areas that are actually the worst letting it sit for a few minutes before washing it off you will see a huge difference in your skin in the long run also just side note I use the shampoo right here I've been using it right here when I wash my hair I let it sit for 5 minutes not because I have dandruff but because I have thinning hair there and I have noticed that my hair is starting to get thicker poor AI okay number six benzil peroxide and you're going to go wait wait wait wait wait is benzil peroxide and adne medication yes it is is it great for rosacea no it's not but if you have this little Mite called a Demodex Mite out of control on your face then benzil peroxide can be helpful for you now not all rosacea people have Demodex mites going crazy on their face but a lot of them do and the way I hear it described from my patients is that they feel like their skin is a little bit reactive and itchy not painful not irrit ated but just like this is probably the get your mind out of the gutter okay but this is probably the best action I can describe it as okay but benzil peroxide can help kill it now you don't need a 10% benzil peroxide wash stronger isn't better something like at 5% we have this in my office is great it's going to help kill that bacteria the little mites and keep it at Bay all right FYI because of the drug fact label benzil peroxide comes up as acne but this can be helpful for Demodex mites as well okay number seven my favorite zinc oxide no it's not sunscreen I'm talking about diaper rash cream Triple Paste zinc oxide is a beautiful ingredient it has anti-inflammatory effects when a kid has a rash down there you slap this all over their little tushies in a gentle way in order to minimize their rash to calm the inflammation down so they have less friction Etc on their privates when it comes to your face if you have an inflamed Skin Barrier and you're trying to restore your barrier zinc oxide can really help restore that barrier and when it comes in the form of a diaper rash cream when it's married to petrolatum it will help create an occlusive layer while calming any inflammation down and it works wonders as an overnight mask treatment especially in a dry climate or in a very cold climate or when the temperatures are changing not all diaper rash creams are created equal don't go for one with essential oils definitely don't and make sure there's no steroid in it cuz that can make things worse I was sponsored by this company after I spoke about them it was a very organic thing and that's why I took that sponsorship because I was like how funny Would it be that the one sponsorship I'm excited about is a buttpaste company but this is probably my favorite one not because of that sponsorship I have two kids who are six and four I wasn't sponsored then but this was the one that I used on my kids so that is the diaper rash cream k for that and then we're going to talk about options for quickly prescriptions but we're not going to waste too much time on this because you can't prescribe medications for yourselves at least not as of yet but who knows what the future holds but aik acid 15% that's great you want to incorporate that metronidazol is a topical antibiotic that you guys can use it's been very well studied for rosacea it is also beautiful and santra which is the trade name the generic name is itin is an antiparasitic that also kills Demodex I often times prescribe all three and I tell patients go plop ploop ploop put three dots mix mix mix apply to face twice a day and it really does help a lot with people with rosacea to help keep all of it at Bay and you can use this long term you can use aoic acid when you're pregnant you can use metronidazol when you're pregnant and last I checked you can use cilantro when you're pregnant in office we can take it up a notch and you guys can really help yourselves by reducing the Cosmetic look of redness by getting the beams vascular laser beams also pulse known as the pulse die laser which in my book is the gold standard you guys might get Groupon deals for ipls or bbls for rosacea it doesn't work as well an IPL and a BBL is a light it is not a laser you're going to need a lot more treatments and you better be going to somebody who is qualified because you might get burnt in the process because they are not as specific as a laser and you need to know what you're doing with them in order to treat your rosacea correctly and then if you have enlarged sweat glands on your nose or on your chin you can do electr surgery you can shave it down people actually use sandpaper believe it or not in conjunction with other devices and lasers to help minimize the look of that but you're probably not watching this video I am assuming if that is your case and you have timeus changes on your nose um because it's usually older white men who get that so I don't think they're watching this YouTube um but that is pretty much what we can do the bird ey view in office and the last thing I want to just say is rosacea might appear like a very benign chronic condition but it has a really deep psychological influence and psychosocial impact on people knowing that you're flushing when you're embarrassed makes you more embarrassed and makes it worse as somebody who has had 10 V beams in one year yes 10 why because I would go to the gym and I would get stopped on the street when I was working out and they would ask me do you need to go to the hospital are you okay cuz I looked like a beat I wasn't red I was like purple red and so I told myself let me just treat this with the vbm and I ended up doing 10 one year and I maintain it probably with one or two treatments a year now I treat my whole face it is really psychologically draining thinking oh my God are my emotions showing on my face and my ears so don't just down for rosacea awareness month and if you guys have any questions or comments as always leave them below but I hope you have a beautiful Saturday [Music]",

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "published_at": "2022-05-05T13:00:03Z",
        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and number two for working with us on this video as well as helping make this rosacea education and information possible but remember this is not medical information that's for your doctor to give you do remember to reapply your spf especially if you have rosacea and always remember to be youtiful both inside and out i love you beautiful butterflies and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye you",

        "published_at": "2021-06-23T13:00:10Z",
        "transcript": "so many of you have been requesting videos on rosacea especially since i talked about it being a skin condition that i personally struggle with so i thought a good place to start is to tell you a little bit about what rosacea is and some do's and don'ts to follow if you have rosacea i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and find skincare products that work for you first of all what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic but treatable skin condition that typically involves the face now i say treatable and not curable because sometimes patients will come see me in my office expect to get a treatment regimen for three to four months for their rosacea and then never deal with it again and the reality is that rosacea is a lifelong condition and there will be times when it's flaring and there will be times when it's under really good control but the goals of rosacea management aren't to get rid of it because there's no cure but to manage it in a way where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life and where you're happy with your skin it's a persistent inflammatory skin condition meaning that it often presents with redness and irritation and i'll talk a little bit more about the signs and symptoms of rosacea in a minute but it also affects men and women the women slightly more than men and it is really a disease of adults so the onset of rosacea is usually after the age of 30. more than 16 million americans have rosacea that's about 1 in 20 people and we think that globally about 5.5 percent of the world's population also has rosacea rosacea symptoms can include easily flushing or blushing persistent facial redness visible vessels on the skin surface easily irritated skin scaly skin dry skin itchy skin it also can affect the eyes so some people will get grittiness or irritation in their eyes and the last thing is that rosacea can have pimples and so it is often misdiagnosed as acne someone with rosacea might just have one or two of those symptoms and someone might have all of the things i just listed so it really can exist on a spectrum of severity but also the presentation can vary widely from person to person one question i get all the time is why do i have rosacea what is causing it is it something that i am doing and oftentimes it's not it we know that rosacea is caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors but a lot of times people don't have full control over those and so it's not about what's causing your rosacea at that point it's more about you have rosacea what are we going to do about it and it's great that we have awesome treatments to help get rosacea under control for people and manage those signs and symptoms so they're not suffering from their skin condition on a day-to-day basis prior to just a few years ago we used to categorize people with rosacea based on kind of the main signs or symptoms that they were presenting with i'm gonna go over those four categorizations even though we don't really use those clinically anymore because i do think it helps people understand the signs and symptoms that rosacea can present with but just know we don't use those categorizations anymore because we understand that people with rosacea can kind of have overlapping symptoms that span more than one category the first of sort of these four categories of rosacea is something called erythematolangictatic rosacea and really what this means is rosacea presenting with facial redness and typically this is redness in the center of the face so the chin the cheeks the nose and the forehead and this is redness that is often present at baseline but then gets worse with flushing or blushing based on exposure to certain triggers and then with that flushing or blushing you can also have altered sensations of the skin like sensitivity stinging burning or sort of this overwhelming heat sensation the other thing that can happen with this erythematologic rosacea is the presence of telangiectasias which are dilated blood vessels that are visible on the skin surface the second prior subtype of rosacea was something called papulopustular rosacea and really this was rosacea presenting with red bumps or red pustules which are red bumps filled with pus this is the type of rosacea or a feature of rosacea that is most commonly mistaken or mistreated as acne so it's something that's important for your doctor to be able to recognize the third prior categorization of rosacea was something called thymidus rosacea also called rhinophyma when it specifically involved the nose but really this is the development of sort of a thick bumpy texture to the skin and it's not a common feature of rosacea but it's certainly something to keep an eye out for the fourth category of rosacea was ocular rosacea or rosacea involving the eye this will often present as irritation light sensitivity watering eyes a gritty sensation in the eye but like i said before we are not using these four categorizations anymore we know that people can have redness and eye symptoms or feminist features and papules and pustules so it's more about what each unique person is presenting with when we're diagnosing and treating their rosacea so let's get into the do's and don'ts of rosacea i just want to put a caveat here though that these are guidelines they are not strict rules i know i'm a physician i'm a board certified dermatologist and i'm telling you these things about rosacea but just know that everyone's skin is different and if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is fine it's no big deal but these might be things that are worth thinking about if your rosacea is not under optimal control and you're trying to figure out ways for you to intervene and make a meaningful positive difference see a dermatologist we are able to accurately diagnose and give you a treatment plan for your rosacea i cannot tell you how many times i've seen rosacea misdiagnosed as acne lupus an allergic reaction eczema seborrheic dermatitis if your face is red or bumpy or sensitive and you don't know why get the help of an expert to make sure you're treating the right thing get to know your rosacea triggers and then avoid those triggers so although we don't know all of the causes of rosacea we do know certain environmental factors make rosacea worse and they can really vary from person to person so things like sun exposure hot or cold weather stress alcohol chocolate dairy spicy foods i mean the list goes on and it really is unique to each person what i recommend is that if you're not sure what your triggers are keep a rosacea diary any time your rosacea is flaring write down what you ate what you drink and what your surrounding environment is like being more aware of your triggers and avoiding them will absolutely help your rosacea stay under better control protect your skin from the sun so wide brim hats please and then sunscreen every single day now i used to tell my rosacea patients to use mineral-based sunscreens only so those with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as the uv filters because we thought they were maybe a little bit less irritating but what i found over time is that a lot of my rosacea patients can tolerate chemical uv filters in their sunscreen just fine so rather than limiting my patients sunscreen options i let them know that it might be a little bit of trial and error to find a sunscreen that they love but once they do use it every day keep your skin well moisturized people with rosacea often will have some skin barrier disruption and be more prone to barrier disruption even if they're using gentle skin care so using a nice moisturizer that feels good on your skin that doesn't cause stinging every single day and maybe sometimes twice a day if you're feeling particularly dry will help your skin feel better and look better too and my final do is have realistic expectations of what's achievable when treating rosacea typically the goals should be to have fewer flares and have your symptoms be well managed but if your goal is to have zero evidence that you've ever had rosacea you're really likely to be disappointed and i'm not saying that to be debbie downer dermatologist over here but if you focus on incremental improvement you're much more likely to find success in your treatment and be happier for it let's get into the don'ts i feel like i have to say this one more time before i get into the don'ts which is if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is totally fine that's okay keep doing it these are not rosacea laws these are just recommendations don't overheat your skin or expose it to extreme temperatures now this can be tricky to do all of the time but we do know that really cold weather and wind as well as really hot weather and indoor heating can all flare rosacea don't rub or scrub the face so any type of physical manipulation or physical exfoliation can cause increased redness and irritation so that goes for physical exfoliants like microbeads or scrubs as well as even like the rough fibers of a towel rubbed on the face they can all cause increased irritation so pat your face dry don't aggressively massage it just be nice to your skin don't use too many products a simple skincare regimen really is best especially if you're incorporating prescription topical medications to treat your rosacea you really don't want to be layering product after product after product you also might be sensitive to certain products so doing a little patch test in front of your ear or on your jawline for several days before kind of using it all over your entire face is not a bad idea don't use certain skin care ingredients that are known to trigger rosacea not every person with rosacea is going to be sensitive to the same types of skincare ingredients but in a survey conducted by the national rosacea society there were some ingredients that more people tended to be sensitive to and those are things like alcohol witch hazel fragrance menthol peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil there are other types of skin care ingredients like tretinoin and retinoids salicylic acid glycolic acid benzoyl peroxide antioxidants and topical vitamin c and people want to know i have rosacea those things can be irritating can i use them and really it's on a case-by-case basis one thing i recommend is never introducing more than one active to your regimen at once so if you're thinking okay i want to introduce a retinoid go low and slow and kind of see how it works out for you i use tretinoin in my routine even though i have rosacea but i could not do that initially i had to get my rosacea under really good control before i could incorporate that ingredient i never want to say anything is truly off limits for my rosacea patients but just know that you have to use things like acids or exfoliators with caution and understand that even if you can't tolerate them at this point in your rosacea journey you might be able to in the future don't be afraid to use prescription medication i find that sometimes in clinic i meet resistance from patients who just want to use over-the-counter options but this is a true skin disease and i don't find that most of my patients want over-the-counter options for their other types of diseases that they have skin disease should be no different don't be afraid of the prescriptions they are really developed for the treatment of rosacea they have been well studied give them a shot and my final don't is if you have rosacea and you have not been able to get it under control don't feel hopeless okay team up with a dermatologist maybe get a second opinion and also understand that rosacea is constantly being researched we are learning more about this condition day by day and as we move forward we are going to have even better treatments and interventions to offer what tips have helped you with your rosacea put them in the comments below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as

        "published_at": "2021-07-31T14:00:20Z",
        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "you have no idea why your cheeks are so\nred all the time today our topic is about rosacea hey wishtrenders welcome\nback to Wishtrend TV it's your girl Eunice in the house today\nI know y'all missed me well anyways guys on the last episode of do and don'ts we\ntalked about blackheads if you haven't seen that video yet go check it out\nright now or maybe after this video so today guys I'm gonna talk about\nsomething very special for those of you who are really really really frustrated\nbecause you have no idea why your cheeks are so red all the time I feel you guys\nokay I'm on the same page as y'all I know this can be very stressful that\nis why today our topic is about rosacea when blood vessels constantly expand and\ncontrast and they actually lose the string to contrast back that is when it\ncauses the face to flush there are three main reasons of rosacea number one is\nhormones the most common cause of redness the results from decrease of estrogen level number two is changes in temperature the\ntemperature differences between indoors outdoors UV rays or even long-term\nexposure to the cold weather are all changes in temperature that causes\nredness number three the skin barrier using the wrong skincare products can\ncause redness by damaging the skins barrier so now that we've learned about\nthe causes of rosacea stay tuned until the very end because we're gonna be\nactually talking about how you can prevent rosacea and tips on how to\nimprove it all right so for today's do and don'ts we\nhave prepared seven tips on how to prevent\nor to improve rosacea so let's get started\ndo number one: foods that help with facial flushing one of the ingredients\nthat is excellent is mulberry leaf now this is a cold natured ingredient and\nalso this is not just great for the red flushing of your face but also it's\ngreat for your migraines we want to recommend that you just drink mulberry\ntea it'll be really nice to drink dried mulberry tea or we want to recommend\nthat you mix with water and Mulberry powder together that's a great\ncombination too then the second food is beans beans beans beans I love beans\neverybody loves beans and for those of you who have went through rosacea due to\nhormones we want to highly recommend beans beans are rich in isoflavones and\nthey also function as female hormones DK over there say he doesn't like beans but\ni like beans and beans are very very good for you next food is a very\nfamiliar one it's oranges did you know that oranges contain vitamin P which\nfunctions to strengthen skins capillaries this helps them to be less\nsensitive to external irritants and this helps with rosacea number two cleanse\nwith cold water using cold water to wash your face or to splash it on your face\nalleviate actually facial flushing causing the blood vessels to contract\nalso did you know that putting ice on the roof of your mouth actually helps to\nlower the temperature of your mouth slightly lowering the blood temperature\nof the blood vessels that goes through your throats the brain detects the slight\nslight temperature change and contracts the blood vessels to alleviate redness\nespecially for special occasions where you really don't want your face to\nbecome red you want to prevent that it's great if you put an ice in your mouth or\nyou get a cold drink to prevent your face from flushing. do number three lower\nthe skin's temperature rosacea results as the face's\ntemperature increases so it's helpful to lower the body's temperature so if you\nkeep your feet or the lower part of your body cooled or in cold water this can\nactually help to prevent rosacea in addition to lower the temperature of\nyour face with skincare we want to recommend that you use products with\ncooling agents we want to recommend that you use products that has really\nexcellent ingredients or agents to lower the skin use a product that can actually\nlower the skin temperature by one degree and it will hydrate skin from deep within\ndo number four care for the skins with sheet masks now sheet masks\nactually care for the skin temperature as a whole thing it's an excellent\nexcellent thing prevent rosacea with sheet masks that not only hydrates\nand soothe the skin but make sure that you use a product that doesn't have\nharsh substances like alcohol artificial coloring and phenoxyethanol we recommend\na super super gentle type of sheet mask the gauze type of sheet mask to prevent\nrosacea and another thing is we want to recommend that you use products with\nceramides in it to strengthen the skins barrier or we want to recommend a sheet\nmasks that lowers the temperature of the skin so that I can prevent rosacea and\nnot only that it suits heat and it has gentle agents in do number five\nstrengthen the skins barrier using the wrong cosmetics actually damages our\nskins barrier making our skin more vulnerable to external irritants because\nof this we need to strengthen our skins barrier with the proper and right\nproducts prevent redness and strengthen the skins barrier by using products with\ningredients such as stearic acid caprylic and Capric triglyceride\nwhich was a very mouthful but work really well to strengthen the skins\nbarrier Do number six apply UV Protection UV rays expands the capillaries now this\nis why it's so important for you to avoid the sunlight and for you to put on\nsunscreen even though when you are indoors use a product that has both UVA\nrays UVB rays and that can protect the heat all at the same time this will help\nto lower the skin's temperature by preventing rosacea for you guys Do number 7: makeup that covers redness When covering redness it's important that you\nuse a yellow tone base to cover your skin now this is much better than using\na really thick or concealer that doesn't fit your skin tone with the full full\ncoverage so cover your redness this with a very natural BB cream that can cover\nyour redness and both your pores as well use a BB cream that is layerablel that\nis buildable because you need to stack it up a little bit to cover the rosacea\nand we want to recommend that you use BB cream with a very natural finish because\nyou don't want to use those BB creams often that has great kind of tone to it until now we have learned about the do's for rosacea now let's go on to the\ndon'ts for rosacea Don't number one processed or overly stimulated foods in\nparticular, fillers in processed foods actually causes rosacea so you should\navoid foods that can raise the body's temperature I know how hard it can be\nbecause I love love spicy food too but really really spicy food or salted food\ncan have an effect on rosacea instead nourish the skin with fresh produce and\nalso protein and carbohydrates and an adequate amount of fats Don't number two: harsh exfoliation those that tends to have rosacea also has\nsensitive skin isn't that true it goes hand-in-hand right so using a harsh wash\ntowel or using a scrub can actually damage our skins barrier and it can\nworsen our rosacea avoid harsh excessive foliation and we need to put our focus\non exfoliating while hydrating the skin at the same time use essence type of\nproducts that contains AHA to gently melt away dead skin cells while at the\nsame time that has really hydrating agents as well to moisturize the skin\nand to exfoliate the skin at the same time don't number three cleansers that\nleave the face dry cleansers that give you a very squeaky-clean\nkind of finish also washes away our natural oils this leads to harsh\nirritation and dryness making the symptoms of rosacea even worse those\nwith rosacea should use about two to three pumps of a low pH cleanser these\ncleansers actually leave a less of a dry feeling so let's care for our rosacea\nwith hydrating cleansers Don't No.4:  ingredients that trigger rosacea\nwhile you should definitely avoid harsh products like alcohol you should also be\nvery careful of ingredients such as peppermint eucalyptus and clove oil which\ncan induce rosacea so those with rosacea should use\nproducts with really mild ingredients that can calm your skin like Guaiazulene at\nthe last step of your skin care apply a generous amount of Guaiazulene cream on to\nthe spots or the areas that you have rosacea it will alleviate rosacea caused\nby heat and irritation not only that it will calm and regenerate the skin this\nproducts nickname is actually called the blue cream for the red skin so just by\nthat nickname you can get an idea of how effective this cream is to calm your\nrosacea more exciting news oh my goodness news for y'all I know that we were very\nannoyed because we love the blue cream and there was a tiny tiny little bottle\nof 30 milliliters but Klairs has answered our prayers because a new\nproduct is coming out it's the same thing but in 60 milliliters so it's a\nhuge tube for us to use and I thank Klairs for answering\nour prayers and making it bigger don't number five hot showers hot springs and\nsaunas a lot of us probably really love long hot showers and also going to the\nhot springs and going to sauna it's one of my favorite things to do with my mom\nhowever this of course can help with blood circulation but it is really\nreally bad for rosacea this constant exposure of heat actually expands our\ncapillaries so this can actually worsen the symptoms of rosacea don't number six\nblood pressure medicines blood pressure medicines actually expands the blood\nvessels so it has the ability to induce rosacea\naside from blood pressure medicine and angina medicine common painkillers or\nthe medicine for our stomach can cause rosacea so we want to make sure that you\ndouble check your medicine cabinet to be safe but to be more safe we really need\nyou to double check with your doctors because you might need these medicines\nokay all right guys don't number seven Don't drink alcohol. as alcohol is broken down in our liver\nit not only expands our blood vessels but acetaldehyde produced within the\nbody as metabolism occurs induces rosacea as well so because of this\nreason I know it's hard but for those of you who is struggling with rosacea needs\nto stay away from alcohol alright guys so that is it for today for those of you\nwho are really stressed due to rosacea we really hope from the bottom of our\nheart that this video could have helped and for the next video we're gonna\nactually have four reviewers episode it's gonna be super fun we're gonna have\na lot of hairy friends who try out hair removal products so it's gonna be super\nfun so you guys have to watch it okay alright guys thank you so much for\ntuning in until the very end and please subscribe and like this video and I'll\nsee you guys next time remember guys we're beautiful just as we are",

        "transcript": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition\u00a0\nthat usually affects the face. Its often mistaken\u00a0\u00a0 for acne, eczema, or an even allergic skin\u00a0\nreaction. It causes redness and visible blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels in your face and sometimes produces\u00a0\nsmall red, pus filled bumps that flare up for\u00a0\u00a0 weeks to months, disappear and reappear when\u00a0\nyou least expect. In this video, im going to\u00a0\u00a0 go over what rosacea is, what causes it, how\u00a0\nto treat rosacea, and 1 very important tip you\u00a0\u00a0 dont want to miss out on when it comes to\u00a0\npreventing it,, so stay tuned till the end.\u00a0 Hi guys, yaseen arsalan, media pharmacist here on\u00a0\nyoutube, this week's video is on rosacea. Smash\u00a0\u00a0 the like button below NOW, as there is a ton\u00a0\nof useful information in here, that I know you\u00a0\u00a0 can benefit from. Also, it helps others find this\u00a0\nvideo as well, iso we can beat rosacea together.\u00a0 Rosacea affects more than 16 million Americans,\u00a0\nwhich is another reason why i wanted to make this\u00a0\u00a0 video. To hopefully point you in the direction\u00a0\nwhen it comes to understanding managing rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and when to let your doctor know. And although,\u00a0\nthe cause of rosacea is still unknown, experts\u00a0\u00a0 believe that the following factors may contribute:\u00a0\nHot drinks and spicy foods,Red wine, alcoholic\u00a0\u00a0 beverages, Temperature extremes, like going\u00a0\nfrom really cold to really hot or vice versa,\u00a0\u00a0 saunas, sunlight or wind, emotions, and even\u00a0\nvarious cosmetic products. Rosacea is more\u00a0\u00a0 common in females than males, and it usually\u00a0\ndevelops after the age of 30. And there is 4\u00a0\u00a0 types you should know of. You have ocular rosacea,\u00a0\nwhich includes eye redness and irritation and\u00a0\u00a0 swollen eyelids. Papulopustular rosacea, which\u00a0\nincludes flushing, swelling, and breakouts that\u00a0\u00a0 resemble acne. Erythemato-telangi-ectatic\u00a0\nrosacea which includes skin discoloration,\u00a0\u00a0 flushing, and visible blood vessels referred to\u00a0\nas spider veins, which you may have heard of. And\u00a0\u00a0 lastly, phymatous rosacea: which leads to bumpy\u00a0\nskin, often accompanied with an enlargement of the\u00a0\u00a0 nose and spider veins can be present too. Although\u00a0\nNo specific test is used to diagnose rosacea. You\u00a0\u00a0 should let your doctor know of the history of\u00a0\nyour symptoms so they can look at your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and rule out other conditions that\u00a0\ncould exist, such as psoriasis,\u00a0\u00a0 eczema, or lupus as the signs and symptoms may\u00a0\nlook alike. If your symptoms involve your eyes,\u00a0\u00a0 your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist\u00a0\n(ophthalmologist) for further evaluation.\u00a0 Now lets look at some treatment option and what\u00a0\ncan you do. Before I go into home remedies you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out starting today, its best to\u00a0\nlet your doctor know of your condition,\u00a0\u00a0 as they most likely will recommend topical\u00a0\nproducts that reduce redness, and can possibly\u00a0\u00a0 be more advantageous, especially if you haven\u2019t\u00a0\ntried them out before. Brimonidine or (Mirvaso)\u00a0\u00a0 and oxymetazoline or (Rhofade) reduce redness\u00a0\nby constricting blood vessels and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 results within 12 hours after use. The\u00a0\neffect on the blood vessels is temporary,\u00a0\u00a0 so the medication needs to be applied regularly to\u00a0\nmaintain improvements. Other topical products have\u00a0\u00a0 less effect on the redness but help control\u00a0\nthe pimples of mild rosacea.These include\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid and metronidazole and take up to\u00a0\n6 weeks to show improvement. Your doctor may\u00a0\u00a0 also prescribe antibiotic such as doxycycline or\u00a0\nOracea for moderate to severe rosacea with bumps\u00a0\u00a0 and pimples. ANd if if your rosacea is severe\u00a0\nand nothing else helps, your doctor may suggest\u00a0\u00a0 isotretinoin which is a powerful oral acne drug\u00a0\nthat also helps clear up acne like lesions of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea or can recommend Laser therapy and other\u00a0\nlight-based therapies to help reduce all that\u00a0\u00a0 redness. Now lets look at what you can do until\u00a0\nthen. There are 5 things you can starting now.\u00a0 #1: Identify and avoid triggers. Pay\u00a0\nattention to what tends to flare you up\u00a0\u00a0 and do your best to avoid them. For some that may\u00a0\nbe avoiding certain foods, hot drinks, alcohol,\u00a0\u00a0 and spicy foods. Eating foods that contain\u00a0\nthe compound cinnamaldehyde, such as cinnamon,\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate, tomatoes, and citrus may be culprits\u00a0\nas well. So pay attention to food triggers.\u00a0 #2 Protect your face. You want to make sure\u00a0\nthat if your exposed to the sun for long\u00a0\u00a0 periods of time, that you Use a broad-spectrum\u00a0\nsunscreen \u2014 which blocks both uv A and uv B\u00a0\u00a0 rays \u2014 with an SPF of 30 or higher. Because\u00a0\nso many sunscreens contain chemicals that can\u00a0\u00a0 be absorbed and cause irritation like octinoxate,\u00a0\noctosalate, or octocrylene you want to avoid these\u00a0\u00a0 chemical sunscreens and opt for a physical one\u00a0\nlike zinc oxide. I left one that i commend in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, so definitely check that out.\u00a0\nAlso on that note, if you live a colder climate:\u00a0\u00a0 try to cover your face in cold weather as this\u00a0\nis known to trigger rosacea as well. #3 Treat\u00a0\u00a0 your skin gently. Don't rub or touch your face\u00a0\nexcessively. Use a nonsoap cleanser and moisturize\u00a0\u00a0 frequently. Avoid products that contain alcohol\u00a0\nor other skin irritants or comedogenic products\u00a0\u00a0 that block the oil and sweat gland openings. I\u00a0\nleft more information on that below too, so check\u00a0\u00a0 that out. #4. clean your eyelids at least once\u00a0\na day if you have blepharitis, otherwise known\u00a0\u00a0 as an eyelid inflammation occurring at the base\u00a0\nof the eyelid. And if youre unsure that you do,\u00a0\u00a0 have your doctor examine your eyelids. Using a\u00a0\nwarm compress loosens the crust and has been shown\u00a0\u00a0 to help tremendously. People who have dandruff\u00a0\nare more likely to develop blepharitis. So Keeping\u00a0\u00a0 the dandruff under control can help reduce the\u00a0\nsymptoms, which can in theory help reduce rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 symptoms as well. #5 Makeup. Some makeup products\u00a0\nand techniques may help reduce the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0 skin redness. Try powder cosmetics with a green\u00a0\ntone and matte finish. I left one as well in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, that has seemed to help others.\u00a0\nSo check that out too. Does it have to be green?\u00a0\u00a0 Green is opposite of red on the color wheel, so\u00a0\nit's perfect for hiding any redness on your face.\u00a0 Now lets look at one of the most effective ways\u00a0\nto prevent it. Which is stress management. For\u00a0\u00a0 those who experience flare-ups as a result\u00a0\nof stress, stress management is an important\u00a0\u00a0 factor in managing your rosacea symptoms. hile\u00a0\nwe may not always know the cause of our stress,\u00a0\u00a0 we do know what relaxes us. Whether it\u00a0\nis reading a book at the end of the day,\u00a0\u00a0 going for a long walk at lunch hour, or\u00a0\neven calling a loved one just to say hello,\u00a0\u00a0 there are little things that we can choose to\u00a0\ndo each day that will help us better manage our\u00a0\u00a0 emotions and have a positive effect on our skin.\nI hope this video was useful to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 and that I hope you do share this video with\u00a0\nsomeone you know who can benefit from it. I also\u00a0\u00a0 hope that you gain just a little bit more control\u00a0\nover your rosacea flare ups.

        "transcript": "many people blush when they're excited or embarrassed but if you have persistent facial flushing you may be showing one of the symptoms of the common skin condition called rosacea April is rosacea awareness month so joining us to discuss this dermatologist Dr dendra Sing good to have you in to talk about this so tell us what exactly it is cu it's just not about blushing no so rosacea is a chronic skin condition where usually it starts with redness and flushing in the central face but then it can morph into other types of variants so when when you say flushing is it something that just kind of happens and then disappears again or is it yeah it kind of comes and goes and there's triggers that can cause it so people know about red wine alcohol hot liquids spicy foods caffeine emotion stress these are the things that can cause you to flush and then it goes away but over time the redness becomes persistent so you have Rosy Cheeks like permanently what's you know what do we know about Rosia in terms of some people getting it and some people not yeah so we we don't really know what causes it that's the problem so there's lots of theories people have talked about hormones sun exposure uh the immune system bacteria and lately we're talking about a Demodex M it's a m that lives on our skin and the hair follicles yeah I know but we don't know if it causes it we just know that in rosacea sufferers you have more of those mites so it's a target of treatment when we talk about chronic rosacea in terms of the skin is it I mean tell me about can you actually see you know veins as a result of that yeah so there's four types of rosace that's what people don't know so the first one is when you get the redness and flushing and those people often get little veins in their cheeks and they often have sensitive skin and that's more common in women and the second type is when you get bumps and pimples like this type here on the picture so it looks like acne but it's a little different because there's redness around it and we have to be able to determine which is which the third type is when you get it in the eyes it's called yeah yeah you can get in the eyes it's called ocular rosacea and you can't really see it so much but it kind of looks or it feels like a gritty sensation and sometimes you can get inflammation of the eyelids oh boy and then the fourth type is one everyone's scared of that's when we get the big fat nose yeah okay and and and what's that as a result of because we're taking a look at this picture here yeah so so this is a result of overactive oil glands so the nose can become like this one here for example it can be quite large bulbous and there's lots of oil glands there will it go back to normal like can you fix that you can only fix I'm not talking you know plastic surgery what I mean is you know can with treatment well treatment doesn't really the only way to get rid of that is to actually go for surgery oh boy yeah but not everybody gets that tell me about common you know treatments I guess for rosacea so because you have to identify which type it is so the bumps and pimples are easy to treat and so is the ocular Ros in the eyes those respond to antibiotics and creams okay the the big fat nose is usually a surgical one and the one that's the hardest one to treat is the one where you get redness and flushing because that often only responds well to laser and then and Laser will do what does it so laser is like shining a flashlight on your and it TS the blood so itats it up and it kind of scks the blood vessel wall so it kind of eliminates the blood vessel so it reduces the redness so once you have the treatment and let's say you know you're lucky and that the treatment works can it come back well this is the problem so rosacea usually starts in adulthood in the 30s to 50s you're actually the person that usually gets it people of Eastern European descent versus Indians or Asians um but it kind of starts to evolve and then eventually it plateaus we don't have a ton of people in the nursing home with rosace but it's kind individual you know and it would seem that oh is this something you know like exacerbated I by sun or is it something that you know it's of modern times not necessarily no it's not of modern times because if you ever go to the lou for example there's this painting it's called an old man and his grandson and the man is portrayed with a big bulbous nose the big fat nose we're talking about and there's this painting and this is in the Lop that's in the L it's beside the Mona Lisa so I get attracted to this where everybody else goes you go to this one yeah I go to this one but this is from 1480 wow so it's been around for a long time so he's had that of course dermatologists would have recognized that for that painting for doing that we might have helped them yeah wow all right well it was fascinating doctor thank you for coming in thanks so much be pleasure",

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can check it out also if you want to Deep dive on information about any of these skin conditions you can actually search Cassandra Banks and rosacea or Cassandra bankson sunburn or Cassandra bankson skin condition in the YouTube search bar and we've probably done a video on it specifically if you search Cassandra bankson how to treat a sunburn I've shared with you some of my best tips and tricks as well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this

        "transcript": "are you struggling with facial redness postural spots or just irritated skin keep watching to learn a holistic approach to rosacea on its treatment in today's video if you're new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret known may be considered it's a powerful retinoid medication that's often used to treat severe acne but it can also be effective in treating rosacea it's only prescribed in specialist centers if you have difficulty accessing and appropriately qualified medical professional there are online Dermatology Services who can assess your skin where you upload photographs and describe your symptoms a dermatologist then assesses your individual case and prepares a personalized blend of topical treatments suitable for your condition and your skin type I use dermatica for my own personalized night cream and contains a retinoid and a pigment reducer signing up with them at dermatica.com or demonica.co.uk and entering the code Dr Finbar on checkout means you'll get a 10 discount of any products that you purchase so rosacea can be a challenging condition to manage but by looking out for your emotional health make an appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments you can take control over your skin and enjoy a better quality of life if these methods alone don't get you the desired results have a look on their Monica's websites for personal treatment plans or visit an appropriately trained Healthcare professional don't let rosacea hold you back you deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your skin now if you found this video helpful watch this short video on how we can start start

        "published_at": "2023-02-03T17:00:28Z",
        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea the first one is actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big overview of rosacea what it is all the different types Medical Treatments that I recommend and then also a full AM and PM skincare routine please let me know if you have any questions let me know what

        "transcript": "welcome back is it just redness or is it something more if you're experiencing rosacea or think you might be we've got a beginner's guide of tips and tricks to treat it with dermatologist Dr Gita [Applause] talking about what is rosacea yeah I mean I think rosacea is sort of best described as something that is like an inflammatory skin condition your Skin's inflamed it's red it can look like acne it's not it can have these bumps it can feel stingy and tender and it's something that people suffer with chronically we're going to bring in our model Michelle here to help explain so what is it sometimes confused with or yeah you know so it's thank you so much so having Michelle here is great because we can sort of have a look at her skin she's kindly agreed to do that so we've got uh this redness in the background affecting the cheeks the nose the chin the forehead and also some small bumps that can look like acne and so sometimes people think it's acne and that redness in the background that's diffuse sometimes people can mistake that for sensitive skin or irritation and they think oh well it's just the products I'm using it's not an underlying skin condition okay so Michelle for you how long have you had your rosacea for and how would you describe that it presents itself sure um you know it's been about 20 years it started in my 20s and I'm in my 40s now and it's just gotten worse over time really red just as Dr yadav describes it red bumps and can be really sensitive and painful okay we want to talk about uh doctor what cause is this it's a bit complicated but I think I can break it down by saying it's generally sort of the way your Skin's microbiome reacts to the world so we got all this stuff that lives on us it's part of that makes our skin healthy and good but sometimes that gets a little bit out of whack and it can cause inflammation and that's why it doesn't always look the same it can have triggers and flares and it depends on what you're doing to kind of make it look a bit worse or make it feel a bit better okay so you mentioned flare-ups we're going to play a little true or false okay I'll get the audience to play a little true or false with me and we're going to break down some of the things that might cause your rosacea to get worse so here's your first scenario every night Sophia comes home and has several glasses of wine to wind down I feel you Sophia her excessive alcohol has caused her to develop rosacea true or false what do you all think most of you are saying false oh there's some truths in there and I'm a true as well what is it Dr yadav it's false it's false it's false yes [Applause] but maybe a bit of a trick question because you see um alcohol doesn't cause rosacea and certainly there's a bit of stigmatization around gosh that person has that red colored face they're drinking too much it's not that it's that alcohol can flare rosacea and so you may have it in the background already those blood vessels they dilate you start looking a little bit more pink and all the good things in life become harder to look good doing Michelle do you get flare-ups if you've had wine absolutely red wine is the worst I miss it and do you like red wine I love it I'm so sorry thank you okay scenario number two Amanda's skin has changed it feels hot and tender with dry swollen patches that won't clear up with treatment however she can't have rosacea because she's a woman of color is that true or is that false I don't know I thought that was true I didn't know women of color got rosacea but you all are saying it's false I feel like I might be wrong here doctor what is it um sorry to say you are okay before you know you know very good I think one of sort of the key lessons that I like to explain to patients and to everyone here today is that uh skin of color redness doesn't show up so easily on it but it can be there and so it's easy to think that it wouldn't affect someone with brown or black skin but definitely possible okay good to know just maybe harder to see harder to see but it's there so let's talk about ways to treat rosacea Dr yadav walk us through maybe a gentle skin care routine and you know this is something maybe Michelle can adopt as well that's right and you said it gentle is the rule of thumb here so you know I've brought with me a couple of different examples of products starting with a gentle cleanser is the most important you can also use like a micellar water I've picked one that's got aloe in it because that can be soothing for irritated sensitive skin next you're going to want to make sure you use a corrective product something that has azelaic acid for those that are a bit price sensitive there's a great product by the ordinary a little bit more of a sophisticated product might be something by skin suit goals that has a redness neutralizer in it and that works very well as a cream these are both lightweight formulas and you need that for skin that's prone to breaking out with rosacea pimples not acne pimples because it can be occlusive otherwise and the last finishing move if it's in the morning and you have your regular facial routine using a sunscreen Pro tip one that has tinted in it so it's pigmented because that'll protect your skin against visible light in addition to ultraviolet light and that visible light we know in white skin makes it look more red and brown skin can make it look more Brown and pigmentation alteration so it's a great thing to use if you've got rosacea's a tinted sunscreen do you mind just taking that tinted and putting a little bit on mine so that's interesting because I've never heard before that you should stick with a tinted one just because it's also going to relieve some of the color just the discoloration and not make it go worse and that's where the evidence is going and I think it's really important and it feels good it looks good on all of our uh different skin tones it sure does Dr thank you so much let's go to break a great modeling [Applause]",

        "transcript": "Hi I\u2019m Dr. Michele Lee, a board-certified\nophthalmologist, and in this video I am going to address a very common and underdiagnosed\ncause of dry eye: ocular rosacea. So let\u2019s start by talking about rosacea. Rosacea is a skin condition of the mid-face\nthat affects up to 20% of people. People with rosacea are typically prone to\na long blush or flush that can resemble a sunburn, acne-like bumps referred to as papules\nor pustules, or skin texture changes. Rosacea tends to start around middle-age,\nin cycles, and is usually triggered by sun exposure, heat, stress, red wine and other\nalcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. While we don\u2019t really understand the mechanism\nof rosacea, we do know this is an inflammatory condition with an abnormal immune system response,\nand that there is a genetic component to this condition. There are multiple theories on why some people\nget rosacea, including theories linking the bacteria in our gut or small intestine bacterial\novergrowth and mites called Demodex that may be inducing skin inflammation. There are 4 types of rosacea and many people\naffected by rosacea may experience more than one type. Besides ocular or eye rosacea, which I will\nget to later in the video, there is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which is characterized by a prolonged\nblush and persistent redness of the face. With this type of rosacea, you can often see\nenlarged small blood vessels on the skin. Another type is papulopustular rosacea, which\nis characterized by whitehead pustules, which are red and pus-filled blemishes on the cheeks,\nchin, and forehead that are often confused with acne. The most rare and severe form is phymatous\nrosacea, which can result in thickening and discoloration of the skin. Phymatous rosacea usually affects the nose\nand is more common in men than women. So how does this condition affect our eyes? Well, this is a disease of the mid-face, and\nguess what is also in our mid-face? Our lower eyelids! In ocular rosacea, we see inflammation of\nour lower eyelids, classically lid margin telangiectasias. This is easily seen and noted with the slit-lamp\nmicroscope we use in our eye clinic. In ocular rosacea, eyelid inflammation can\ncause blockage of the meibomian, or oil, glands that provide the oil layer of our tears. Having blocked oil glands can cause a form\nof evaporative dry eye, where you make tears but don\u2019t make good quality tears to lubricate\nyour eyes and make you more prone to styes and chalazia, which are caused by blocked\nsweat and oil glands on the eyelids. In addition to dry eye, the eyelids can feel\nirritated and itchy from all the inflammation. In general, there are multiple treatments\nfor rosacea, many of which are beyond the scope of this video on ocular or eye rosacea. First and foremost, preventing and avoiding\ntriggers is the most effective thing you can do. If you suffer from rosacea, please consult with your dermatologist about a treatment plan for your\nskin that might work for you. For ocular rosacea, the treatment principles\nare similar to treating rosacea of the skin. There are a few levels of treatments that\nI discuss with my patients, depending on severity of disease and previous response to medications. Just like with skin rosacea, we want to avoid\nflares, whatever that may be. For some, this includes avoiding heat and\nwarm compresses to the eyes and eyelids, which is unfortunately an effective treatment for\nalmost every other type of dry eye. With minor irritation or symptoms, lubricating\neye drops, specifically preservative-free eye artificial tears, work best. Just how inflamed rosacea skin is sensitive,\nthe eyes and eyelids of rosacea patients are usually sensitive as well and avoiding any\ntriggers, including unnecessary preservatives, can be helpful. If preservative-free tears are not enough,\nwe might need to escalate treatment to a short-term, low-dose steroid eye drop for flares. We never want to stay on steroids for a long\ntime if we can help it, as steroid eye drops for years, even at low doses, can accelerate\ncataracts and elevate eye pressure in a small percentage of patients. Just like with other types of skin rosacea,\noral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines like doxycycline, can be effective in some cases\nof ocular rosacea. Doxycycline at low doses (under 50mg) has\nanti-inflammatory properties that both clinically and symptomatically can help with rosacea\nwhen taken long term. A newer treatment for rosacea and ocular rosacea\nis Intense Pulsed Light or IPL, a laser treatment that has been used for hyperpigmentation of\nthe skin and other types of rosacea and is now being increasingly used for ocular rosacea. This treatment can be effective with multiple\nuses, and there are some eye doctors who use a specific ocular protocol for ocular rosacea\nwith notable success. While this is still not a common tool in every\neye clinic, this is becoming increasingly popular and we might be seeing this tool in\nmore eye clinics as a treatment option for this form of dry and irritated eyes and eyelids. Do you think you might have ocular rosacea? Let me know in the comments below. As a rosacea patient myself, I am very passionate\nabout spreading awareness of rosacea and would love your support so please like and subscribe\nto my channel, and see you next week in my next video.

        "transcript": "redness can be one of the most frustrating and challenging aspects of rosacea the treat in this video we're going to break down what causes redness and rosacea and how can we approach it I'm Dr John Barbieri a board-certified dermatologist and acting organization expert when we think about redness and rosacea it's really fundamentally about vascular hyper reactivity we have blood vessels in our skin and they can be stimulated by all different sorts of things like UVA radiation like or microbiome and people have rosacea particularly redness those blood vessels are too sensitive to these triggers so when we think about treating redness and rosacea a fundamental aspect of that is just good General Skin Care we need to be thinking about daily sunscreen at least SPF 30 to 50 or more to help block that UV radiation that can be triggering those blood vessels we want to think about what we can do to help our Skin Barrier using good moisturizers we want to think about if in our own lives we notice any triggers in our diet or our lifestyle that might be driving that redness in rosacea but for many that's not enough we need to go beyond just General Skin Care one strategy that can be a helpful starting place is just cosmetic camouflage rosacea redness can be hard to treat and sometimes the best solution is just to help cover it up Green Tinted primers and Foundations can help to counteract that redness and can be a good starting place for people who are struggling with redness and rosacea Beyond cosmetic camouflage we have a bunch of topical pill medicines and then also procedural treatments that we can do to help with redness and rosacea the first set of medications we use the treat rosacea are creams and they're really two main medications that we use here oximetazzling and vermonidine both of these medications are called Alpha agonists they cause the blood vessels to squeeze down the skin and in rosacea right that redness is due to faster hyperreactivity those blood vessels are too active there's too much blood flow to the Skin So if we use a cream that does the opposite that tells them to shut down a little bit to have less blood flow to the skin that can help address redness and rosacea in general both of these creams can be helpful they provide a temporary Improvement in redness lasting about eight to ten hours however it does seem like with consistent use there may be a decrease in overall redness over time both of these medications have a potential risk of what's called rebound whereas the medication wears off the redness can actually be a little bit worse than when it started for a temporary period of time it seems like this may be more of an issue with bromonidine than oxymetazoline so in my practice I generally prefer oxymetazoline to brimonidine or thinking about cream treatments for redness and rosacea now oxymetasolin is available as a prescription cream that goes under the brand name ropate but there also are ways you can get it as a compounded medication and actually oxymetazoline is the main ingredient in aprenasal spray which is available over the counter it is a lower strength than the creams that we use to treat rosacea but there have been some reports of using that lower strength oxygen tasolin mixing it maybe with a moisturizer and using it to treat rosacea so that's another strategy that's available we also have pill medicines that can help with redness and rosacea particularly with flushing and these tend to be beta blockers the same idea as oxy and tasseling are trying to really calm down that vascular hyperreactivity in the skin and the main ones that we use here would be like Propranolol or Carvedilol are examples of beta blockers that we can use to help treat severe flushing in rosacea in addition to creams and tablets we also have a bunch of procedural treatments that can help with redness and rosacea these tend to be lasers or other energy device devices that Target redness specifically they use the wavelength of light that's preferentially absorbed by the red in our skin that's able to help get rid of that without hurting our normal skin and these classically are devices like pulse Dye Laser KTP laser and the AG laser and sometimes even intense post light a nice feature of these procedural treatments is that they tend to provide a durable Improvement in redness as I mentioned before the cream treatments like oxymetazolin and bramundi they provide a temporary Improvement of redness lasting about eight to ten hours and while they can cause some reductions in overall redness with consistent use the laser and light based treatments have the advantage of you do a session and that redness is just fundamentally lasts you do another one fundamentally less and you get a durable Improvement in the redness of rosacea often it does take about two to four sessions to reach Peak improvement with these devices but those gains that are achieved with these energy-based devices they tend to persist over time and so those who are looking for doing a couple of treatments and then not need to be doing something daily to address the retina Center rosacea these can be a really nice option in addition lasers and energy-based devices tend to work better for talangectages those kind of broken little blood vessels on the skin than other kinds of creams or pill medications for redness and rosacea another technique that we can use especially for challenges is called electrodesication where a small electric current is used on top of the skin to cause some localized injury to be able to specifically Target those small broken blood vessels without causing too much damage to the surrounding skin so they'll put it all together we have a number of treatments that can help address redness and rosacea and what's really important about these they tend to differ from the treatments for bumps in rosacea very often I'll see a patient in the office they have both bumps and redness they were started on a treatment like metronidazole or Ivermectin or acylic acid that often is great for bumps but tends not to do a lot for redness while the bumps have improved that redness is still there and that's why it's so important to use redness directed strategies when it comes to treating rosacea and this really starts with basic skin care like protecting ourselves from UV radiation and using moisturizers to help the Skin Barrier moves on to things like cosmetic camouflage like Green Tinted primers and Foundations and then we start to get into more prescription-like treatments we've got the topical creams like oxymetazoline and vermonidine that can provide a temporary Improvement in redness lasting 8 to 10 hours and may even reduce redness overall with consistent use we have procedural treatments like lasers and energy-based devices that can provide a more durable reduction in redness and then finally for severe cases of redness and flushing we sometimes potentially use pill medications like beta blockers like propranolol I hope you found this video helpful if you have please give it a like so we can share it with more in the community and consider subscribing to our channel to stay up to date on the latest in actinarization treatment if you have any other questions about rosacea leave them in the comments

        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

        "transcript": "hi everyone welcome back to another lesson this lesson is on rosacea so we're going to talk about some of the potential causes of this condition we're also going to talk about some of the triggers the signs and symptoms so we're going to get into some of the specific skin lesions that can occur with rosace then we're going to talk about how it's diagnosed and how it's treated so rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition involving recurrent episodes of skin lesions on the face we're going to get into more detail as to these exact skin lesions later on in this lesson rosacea is an autoimmune condition which means that it is the patient's own immune system that attacks its own cells and tissues to cause a lot of these signs and symptoms now although this is known to be an autoimmune condition the pathophysiology is not entirely understood but we're going to talk about some of the known pathophysiology later on in this lesson and rosace may be associated with other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease like ulcer of cius and Crohn's disease and cardiovascular diseases and neurologic diseases and rosacea is estimated to affect at least 5% of the general population which means that it is is a relatively common condition and it is more likely to affect certain ethnic groups particularly those with Celtic Heritage those individuals with Celtic Heritage have a higher likelihood of having rosacea compared to other populations and this condition affects individuals between the ages of 30 to 50 most often now let's talk about some of the potential causes of rosace so although the causes are not entirely known it's believed that genetics are involved we talked about some of those ethnic groups that are at higher likelihood of having rosace so genetics are likely involved in rosace now some other potential causes of rosace include Demodex mites Demodex mites are these microscopic hair follicle mites and it's been shown that when looking at lesions of patients who have rosacea their lesions contain high levels of these Demodex mites so there does seem to be an association between high levels of these Demodex mites or these hair follicle mites and rosacea and there has been another potential cause that has been noted and this is an infection with helicobactor poori or hpylori this is a gram negative bacteria that can cause an infection in the stomach so there does seem to be an association between an infection with H pylori and the onset of rosacea as well there has also been some association with exposure to ultraviolet or UV rays this may be more of a trigger and we're going to talk about triggers of skin lesions later on in this lesson so this may be more of a trigger of Ros not the exact cause and then certain medic have also been noted to either cause rosacea or trigger an underlying rosace some of these medications include steroids and some blood pressure medications now let's talk about some of the pathophysiology behind why rosacea occurs so it all has to do with disregulation of the innate and adaptive immune functioning and vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels so vasod dilation would be dilation of blood vessels so these are the two main categories of mechanisms and the reason why these may occur why disregulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning may occur includes increased expression or overexpression of tole like receptor 2 which is a cell receptor involved in annate and adaptive immune functioning so overexpression and overactivation of this receptor seems to be part of the pathophysiology in rosacea and with regards to the vasod dilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels there seems to be an increased release of vasoactive peptides so increased release of vasoactive peptides has been noted in patients with rosacea and patients with rosacea also seem to have higher levels of other particular receptors including increased or overexpression of transient receptor potential vanilloid one or trpv1 receptor and increased expression of trpa1 or transient receptor potential anchor in one receptor and there's some other receptors as well and each of these receptors seems to Al Al be associated with some of the triggers we're going to talk about later on in this lesson so some of these are involved in heat and cold Sensation that can cause changes to vasil regulation so we're going to talk a bit more about this later on in this lesson as well so some of these receptors can be involved in why certain things trigger the onset of skin lesions in rosacea but there also seems to be some interplay with having Demodex mites or infestation of Demodex mites and an infection with H pylori which seem to also increase some of the activation of some of these receptors and release of vasoactive peptides in some patients so again not all of the pathophysiology is known but these are some of the known factors in rosacea now there are several subtypes of rosacea that cause different clinical presentations one subtype is known as aromatic this subtype is more commonly going to be the initial presentation of rosacea another one is papulo postular this one can appear like acne and often times will occur later on in life so it can often times be termed as adult acne there is also a subtype known as fattis subtype and there's also one that is known as ocular subtype which affects the eyes and we're going to talk about all the clinical signs and symptoms of each of these subtypes later on in this lesson now it's important to make note of the fact that individuals can have features of different subtypes they can have some features of multiple subtypes and the subtypes may change over time they may be more likely to have aromatic subtype and then they may be more likely to have fattis subtype later on in their life now before we talk about the skin lesions let's talk about where they affect the face often times it's going to affect the forehead the nose and upper cheeks and the chin these are going to be common areas where we see a lot of the lesions we're going to talk about in this lesson and often times are going to be symmetric so if you see it on one side if you see it on the patient's right side you're also going to see it on the patient's left side so they're often times going to be symmetric and in these locations now let's actually talk about the clinical features of rosacea so with regards to the athato telen acatic subtype we see tasas tasas are these small dilated blood vessels that are often termed as spider veins so we can see these on the face in those areas we talked about before this is often times going to be more noted in older age we can also see Etha which is a reing of the skin this can be transient or non-transient so transient being that it can come and go away so it's temporary or it can be non-transient meaning that it can be permanent So the patient's face can become very rened and often times this is going to affect younger age groups this again is going to be part of the arithat telic tatic subtype and we can also see flushing in some patients so flushing is going to again be a transient reing of the face and it's often times going to occur in younger age groups now with regards to the papulopustular subtype of rosacea that we talked about before this is going to lead to papules so papules are these inflammatory raised skin lesions and we can also see pules so pules are also inflammatory but they are pus filled so they can often times be mistaken for acne and often times be termed as adult acne or acne rosacea but is not actually the same condition as acne because there are no comedones if you want more information on acne please check out my full lesson on that topic but suffice to say with the skin lesions in rosacea the way to distinguish these papules and postul from actually having acne vulgaris there are no comedones and often times a patient's going to have an episode of these clinical features and then they're going to go into remission and then they're going to go into another episode so there's often times going to be periods where they have an episode of skin lesions that go into remission and then something triggers them to also have another episode so there's often times going to be a pattern of episode and remission of these skin lesions some other clinical features that can be noted with these skin lesions include burning sensation from the lesions a tingling sensation from the lesions a stinging sensation can also be noted and then puitis which is an itching sensation so often times these are going to be some of the other clinical features that can be noted from these skin lesions as well let's talk about the ocular form of this condition so the ocular form of rosacea actually affects a majority of patients that actually get rosacea so 50 to 75% of patients will have eye involvement and often times what's going to be noted with ocular rosacea is that patients have issues with dryness of their eyes redness of their eyes or tearing they can often have blurred vision or light sensitivity and some more specific findings can be blefaritis which is an inflammation of the eyelids conjunctivitis which is an inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eyes keratitis which is an inflammation of the corne of the eye and iritis which is an inflammation of the iris of the eye so all of these can be noted in patients with rosacea as well and again it can affect 50 to 75% of patients who have rosacea and some patients can have another Finding known as a rinofima rinofima is an enlargement of the nose so this enlargement of the nose is due to hyperplasia of sebaceous glands so these sebaceous glands become enlarged and lead to an enlargement of the nose and this can often be due to chronic long-standing untreated rosacea so if there is long-standing untreated rosacea it can lead to this rinofima and what is noted with rhop is that almost all cases of rinofima occur in males it is very rare in female patients so again this is another clinical presentation of rosacea that can be found and rinofima would be under the classification of the fattis subtype of rosacea now let's talk about some of the triggering or exacerbating factors we talked about some of the potential triggers that can cause or increase the likelihood of having skin lesions from rosacea some of these include stress so stress can trigger rosacea skin lesions consumption of caffeine can also trigger the onset of skin lesions alcohol can also trigger skin lesions as well and consumption of hot liquids can trigger or worsen skin lesions in rosacea some other exacer factors include eating certain spices so certain very spicy foods can actually trigger the onset of skin lesions in rosacea we talked about some of those receptors when we talked about the pathophysiology of rosacea and a lot of them can be triggered by certain spices so capsacin in some very spicy foods can actually trigger and activate some of those receptors significant temperature changes so going from very hot to very cold that can also trigger skin lesions as well sunlight exposure we talked about UV light potentially being a cause but it's more likely to be an exacerbating factor and then wind exposure so wind hitting the face especially with significant changes in temperature this can also exacerbate or trigger skin lesions in rosacea as well so how do clinicians diagnose and treat rosacea the diagnosis of rosacea is often times going to be a clinical diagnosis so looking at the history and physical examination and getting some of those triggers we talked about before this is going to be enough to make the diagnosis for clinicians now with regards to how clinicians treat rosacea oftentimes they're going to break it down into categories of treatments so there's going to be lifestyle treatments so it's important to avoid exacerbating and triggering factors we talked about those in the last slide and gentle cleansing with moisturizers can also be helpful for some of those skin lesions and then sun protection so photo protection using sunscreen with at least an SPF of 30 can be helpful and the rest of the treatments are going to be more tailored to the specific spefic type of rosacea so with regards to ocular rosacea artificial tears can be helpful and metronidazol eye drops can also be helpful with regards to Emma so that reing of the skin of the face rodine tartrate gel can be helpful and oxymetazoline hydrochloride gel can also be helpful with regards to inflammatory lesions on the face these include tetracyclin and aiyin and topical metronidazol topical zic acid and icin cream to treat those Dem mites can also be helpful as well and with regards to issues with flushing in rosacea some clinicians may use propanolol or corvalol and laser therapy laser therapy can be helpful for the flushing in rosace in clinici can often treat the fima or the rinofima with doxycyclin isotretinoin and tetracyclin when it is in the inflammatory stage of the Rhino but when it's in the non-inflammatory stage when it has become enlarged in permanent surgical resection may be required and laser surgery can also be helpful in reducing the Rhino fima so if you want to learn more about other Dermatology

        "transcript": "[Music] it really makes me feel ugly [Music] it makes me feel dirty i just don't feel confident anymore [Music] i'm just going to go back to bed on my day off i'm just just going to i just don't feel confused a day today i feel so depressed [Music] my nose is changing shape day by day [Music] and the blood vessels i can feel them burst in pain is chronic [Music] it's like i've got no face left it's just all nose [Music] i just hate everything about myself at the moment [Music] hello i don't want me coming around because i've just been worried about you come in come in just recently i've met a really lovely group of friends oh i can't wait to hear what this is all about i think i'm going to lose those friends though because i'm making so many excuses it's really affecting my life and i've not told them why they must just think i'm being well she don't want to know anymore i don't feel very lazy like especially when they say more men get this oh right i just feel like a free can when she stopped coming out at all and really even stopped phoning i couldn't really work it out so it's quite a worry really hello i'm here to see dr emma i'm hoping today that dr emily is going to be able to tell me that she's going to be able to help me it would give me my life back it'd give me my confidence back i wouldn't feel so ugly and just please god she can hi is it trish yes hello come with me thank you come on in patricia thank you how are you um a bit depressed today as you can see the redness i feel like my nose is just growing and growing all over my face like a clown and how long have you had this problem for her i would say at least 11 years okay but just in the last 18 months it's this redness that's causing my nose to swell is it painful i'm getting blood vessels breaking and they kill you it just you the pain is excruciating i don't like the way i feel i'm usually i like to go out i like to meet my friends but i i don't want to do that at the moment yeah and it is it's it's really destroying me inside yeah i'm sorry it's having such a horrible impact on you it's just destroying my life i know we kind of need to fix that a little bit too it's more than just the skin on your face that we need to fix it's kind of how you're viewing yourself isn't it okay right well i'm gonna get a magnifying glass so i can get close in there and have a good look is that okay okay keep those eyes closed for me [Music] your nose is hard as a rock isn't it yeah but it feels a little bit more like a swelling and you've a beautiful sloop to the nose here but then i can see a little bit more bulk coming at this part and then we can see really clearly all of these lines of the vessels okay trish so this most definitely is uh rosacea and rosacea kind of manifests itself in different ways on the skin the main problem for you which is the rhinophyma which just means a thickening change of the nose and becoming redder in color and as well as the rhinophyma has changed you've also got the kind of papules and pustules on the cheeks it's almost a bit like a vicious cycle you've got the redness which is the inflammation and you've got the vessels and then that makes more vessels and more inflammation so it's it's just repeating itself now my treatment program for rosacea for your skin does involve you being quite diligent with it and you can pretty much do it in a couple of minutes and in the morning and a couple of minutes at night time nine you cannot deviate from this the skin treatment no okay no the next thing is is that the tablet themselves will start to gradually and slowly bring down the bulk and start to switch this process off and then reverse the process and then the last thing i need to do is use my lasers on you to get rid of the vessels and the background rareness which is the most satisfying thing that morty and i just we dream of doing this is just wonderful is that okay thank you so much trish you know she was so upset at how this was affecting her and what's really been happening is is the rosacea that she has has been becoming more out of control and she's now developed quite an obvious rhinophyma i'll get back to my life again yeah i know i want to get back to your life so first of all to try and calm the skin as much as possible i need to give her some cream to try and control things but creams are just not going to be enough to cut this and you need to have something by mouth and then i need to give her some laser treatment because the only way to get rid of the redness and the only way to get rid of the vessels is to use a pulsed dye laser [Music] now i've come out of a different person because i've got hope and i'm just over the moon it's just like a miracle [Music] i've now got my cream for my face so i first met trish and diagnosed her with rhinophyma which is a form of rosacea this is just to take um the redness down so she's been started on a medication to try and help regain the symmetry and make it a bit smaller one two three well done and then also i'm using some intense pulsed light to complement it that's the vessel wall just destroyed i just had two sessions of that [Music] so things are doing really well yeah that one's definitely dead at that side i'm a bit swollen at the moment where i've just had the procedure but um i'm gaining a lot more confidence um every day [Music] hi i'm here to see dr emma it's trish i'm really excited to show dr emma today because um it's been a few weeks now and she'll see the difference herself i can't wait for it to sit hi youtube hi nice to see you oh lovely to see you new dress new hair yes new dress new houses the catwalk more confident come on have a seat just up on the bed okay so first of all trish do you have any makeup on no makeup on at all i would have come out with that makeup on it's amazing it is it was mouth yeah it was it was most and the shape was really odd yeah and i just felt like i didn't want to go anywhere or do anything and now that modeness is gone yeah and i just i just feel like a different person let's have a little look wow you've actually got the shape of your nose back look at your cheeks that is just fantastic what i think is really most striking is the um profile of the news returned again whereas this was all bulky out at the side i i need to see for probably about another two or three laser treatments okay where i'm going to be completely happy with it you're using the right creams you've got the right medicines yes and then hopefully this is never going to come back and bother you again honestly you look brilliant it's absolutely brilliant i feel great [Music] you",
