        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "the three best products from the ordinary for rosacea prone skin if you do have rosacea it can be very difficult to find products that work well rosacea naturally is much more sensitive than even dry skin or sensitive skin and there's a lot of different things that can trigger rosacea such as eating spicy foods drinking alcohol or even going out into the Sun rosacea is primarily a vascular condition meaning the little blood capillaries that are naturally in your face are at the root cause for why this flares up for some people and although it's normally this redness in the cheeks rosacea can have pimples it's not the same thing as acne but they can look like acne and it is possible to have both rosacea and acne together these are the three best products from an ingredient perspective that should be okay for rosacea prone skin and that have the actives that have the potential to help and the first one actually mimics what dermatologists prescribe this is the salic acid ten percent in silicone and as a liqu acid is a really cool ingredient you may be familiar with other skincare acids however this one is much more gentle and for rosacea prone skin it can help dermatologists actually prescribe a 15-percent as they like acid solution for some patients with rosacea you can't get that over the counter it's too high of a percentage to get without prescription but this is at 10% and you can find other solutions that have 5% etc this helps with the redness of rosacea but it also helps if you do get those little white pustules those pimple like looking things and azalea kasih does also help with acne in case you have both as the oleic acid can burn a little bit when being put on the skin so do be aware of that but it is one of the ingredients that once the skin builds up tolerance to it can actually help to protect your skin a little bit more over the long run meaning that rosacea prone skin is less likely to flare up from other ingredients being used somewhere down the line because this is an a dimethicone base it's really nice and smooth onto the skin kind of like a primer the only things that it can ball up if you go at it too aggressively so I would recommend starting by patting it on the other thing is that as a liqu acid can be used day and night no problem dr. Sam is a dermatologist that I love and admire and she has used azalea Cassatt on pregnant and nursing patients for those who are pregnant earners it's hard to find skincare that is safe for both you and your baby so it's nice that this is an option and the other thing is that it's fairly unreactive so it's generally okay to use with most other things in a routine because of its silicone base it does work best after your serums either as a step before your moisturizers are kind of in place of your moisturizer or before your sunscreen since it has that silicone butt next you do have to consider sunscreen yes sunscreen can be used to help combat rosacea and the reason why is because the Sun is one of the major flares we see rosacea being vascular can be triggered by a lot of things but most people who suffer from it say that sun exposure is a big one sunscreen and the prevention of the UV rays from damaging those delicate little capillaries inside of the skin is really important not only to prevent it from flaring but to actually keep it under control and down regulate the steps that are already happening in your skin this is a mineral sunscreen from the ordinary I really love this one a lot of people have sensitivities to some of the chemical ingredients in sunscreen a lot of those are things like a boban zone oxybenzone octinoxate Homo say late those are not necessarily bad things however for people with sensitive skin they can be stinging they can be irritating and especially for people with rosacea prone skin the skin is already hypersensitive so you don't want to offend it more this sunscreen is an SPF 30 it's a great option that you could put on in the morning and the other thing is that it does have some other ingredients in here such as urea and such as Alan toen we've spoken about these ingredients before on this channel but as a little reminder these are both very soothing to the skin specifically urea can be helpful and Alan toen has been known to be anti-inflammatory which if you're having a rosacea flare-up would be very useful because we're talking about redness you know that this includes a recommendation for the niacinamide and zinc 10% this is really one of the best solutions that the ordinary has when it comes to large pores oiliness and redness and seeing as rosacea is this redness condition this vascular condition this is a really great place to start niacin amide otherwise known as b3 is a water-soluble vitamin and it really can do amazing things for the skin in combination with the zinc it helps to not only stabilize this but really target the areas of the skin that are experiencing that redness it take a little bit of time and some people have noticed that their skin kind of purges which means it gets a little bit worse before it gets better on initial application of this but especially for those who are struggling from rosacea that has the little white pustules or if you have rosacea and acne in combination this can help to down-regulate your skin's natural oil production so bye-bye grease that could be contributing to some of that and on top of that down regulate the redness that is normally associated with those flushes and those flares total transparency if your rosacea is really bad none of these products are gonna work once you get past kind of a critical point you really do have to go see a dermatologist and get a prescription or make sure it is rosacea and it's not acne in disguise there are also other types of redness in the skin such as erythema that are different than rosacea and need to be approached differently but lucky for you we have a whole bunch of guides on how to use the ordinary products as well as deep dives into basic ingredients and different skin conditions so that you can understand how to be a conscious consumer how to turn and learn your ingredient labels figure out what's in there and work with your healthcare team in order to treat and overall embrace and understand your skin if you learn something here make sure that you that like button and don't forget to brush that's subscribe button if you haven't already more videos can be found right here and I cannot wait to see you beautiful bunch of lies in the next video love you guys bye",

        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "foreign board certified dermatologist welcome to my channel thank you so much for your support thank you for your support on Tick Tock as well we're nearing 1 million friends there thank you for the top doctor Awards Seattle met magazine and Castle Connolly it's been a great year and so I'm really excited to see what 2023 has for all of us and cheers to more fun thank you guys and today is going to be a video I might say rosacea on the title or on the thumbnail but really this is for all of those people out there with sensitive skin including myself during the winter my skin tend to be more sensitive I wouldn't say in general I have sensitive skin but skin types do flip around with the weather you know there's normal oily dry combination sensitive skin types sensitive skin though I definitely do find is something they can flip around based on the weather and definitely in the winter time where we have cold weather you have the heaters on overnight you can wake up with really dry chapped lips and I get irritation around my cheekbones where it gets pretty red and noticeable during the day and how do we hide redness what products do we reach for when we have irritated skin so it's not just for rosacea today it's for those with sensitive skin and when we have irritation a lot of times we panic and we reach for whatever's on our bathroom counter we kind of overdo it and we get into this whole vicious cycle of the redness worsening and so we're gonna go over some gentle products today that you can consider now rosacea let's talk about rosacea if you have rosacea I see this on a daily basis in clinic and it's a chronic inflammatory skin condition where you get redness on your face flushing and you can also get acne rosacea where you get these acneoform red papules or bumps on your face usually around the nose inner cheeks the chin and it flares with stress alcohol sunlight for sure heat so a hot shower taking something hot out of the oven getting that blast of hot air in your face can really trigger whether it's redness and flushing or red bumps and there are different types of rosacea like postula rosacea rhinophymodus rosacea where you get the red nose with bulbous like changes where you have really enlarged oil glands that can be tough to treat and also deep rosacea called granulomatous rosacea so they're different types of rosacea but in general when you have rosacea you're already put into the ultra sensitive bucket in 2020 I saw a lot of people with rosacea having flares of the rosacea because they were on Tick Tock and they saw a popular Korean sheet mask and so people were using it and they got really bad irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from using a sheet mask so be very careful with your new products always start one product at a time about two weeks apart and if you want to spot test on your neck or a small area of your face first I'm all for that if you have rosacea and a lot of people with rosacea can't do those anti-aging skin care ingredients we talk about including vitamin C or ascorbic acid so I always say 10 is kind of like what you're looking for for ascorbic acid going to 15 or more will really increase your risk of irritation La Roche Posay has a lower than 10 percent ascorbic acid they're C cream this is the one that has five percent ascorbic acid metal Castle side and also neurosensing which is soothing as well well especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin and the other ingredient that's notorious for causing acne rosacea flares or rosacea flares would be retinol or retinoids things I prescribed especially the stronger stuff tretino and tazeratine can irritate rosacea and a lot of my patients or rosacea we can't do chemical peels on them because their skin is so sensitive chemical peel what the acids could bring on a flare if you want to use a retinoid I would recommend an over-the-counter retinol that is less potent than the stuff I would prescribe and what can we use for that one good product I like to talk about a lot on this channel is Olay retinol retinol 24 is a nice formulation because it has glycerin it has niacinamide and I like niacinamide combined with my sunscreens cleansers moisturizers and retinol that is anti-inflammatory great for those with acne or rosacea prone skin because it also regulates sebum production and helps with inflammation so it won't clog you up and cause a flare this is a very gentle retinol I would recommend either the max or the retinol 24 plus peptide OG one without the max the max is 20 percent more of their High hydration complex which means maybe more glycerin more niacinamide I don't think it has more retinol I can't tell by the labeling on the website and they don't disclose their retinol percentage either other one that's a little bit more pricey than this because Costco has the OG in a two pack for a great price go for something more expensive like Keels I like this brand a lot this is their micro dose retinol whereas their fast relief is a higher percentage this one here is 0.2 percent and much lower strength so if you're a beginner this is a great one but you also get some additional anti-aging benefits from the peptide in this topical peptides are great because they're self-signaling and they help increase collagen production through cell signaling so I like this one a lot one pump gives you that yellow retinol pea sides amount and you just use that to your entire face so that's a really nice retinol that's gentle now if you can't tolerate any retinol another thing you can consider that's anti-aging would be Heparin sulfate containing product like sente this is nice because this also has cell signaling capabilities increase College gent this is very gentle nice for those with rosacea and they can't use a retinol this is a good option but also an expensive brand but I say worth the price very gentle one pump gives you what you need for your face it comes out as a nice moisturizing cream a little thicker texture there soothing and also effective as well so I like that brand a lot they also came out with a new pigment correction kind of a mask you leave on for 15 minutes I have to review and I'm gonna try to get my hands on to that one but that one's also like 150 bucks for that I know some of you have asked to review that when I release my melasma video so I'm going to look into the brand sentence pigment corrector mask okay now going on to daily routine besides anti-aging what can you do I say have a gentle cleanser you don't have to go crazy with exfoliants lhas ahas bhas and your cleansers I think something gentle like vanic cream vanicream's a king when it comes to sensitive skin care and so their cleanser is great I love their daily facial moisturizers awesome so affordable you can find that Target your local drugstore or online on Amazon and so it's a great brand so reliable I even use that for my kids I use that as like a body wash for my kids and you can use this as a body wash as well their facial cleansers CeraVe is a good one they're hydrating facial cleanser and the winter time is also a great pick lasts forever get the big value size at Target or online and it lasts forever now if you wanted to talk about anti-aging and moisturizers and you can't do the retinol peptide moisturizers topical peptides like we talked about have self-signaling and so we mentioned that with the Keels retinol has peptide and also I forgot to mention Olay has the pomatoil pentapeptide four peptide complex which is also anti-aging the peptide moisturizer by the inkulus just do a little pump there and you can dispense the cream skin fix is another nice brand you can get at Sephora this is their triple lipid peptide cream which is also nice that I've used quite a bit also dispense by pushing on this and gets the cream out very good for sensitive skin now if you have irritation like myself around the cheekbones and you want to sue that I'm all about petrolatum based ointments and this is a small cute mini version of what you get as a tube CeraVe healing ointment and you just put just a small amount around your cheekbones at bedtime so that you don't wake up with a red face or redness on the cheekbones and that's my routine at night but right before I go to sleep get a good fresh layer of ointment over it whether it's Vaseline Aquaphor CeraVe healing ointment I love them all if you have a lanolin alcohol sensitivity or allergy stick with Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment Aquaphor has lanolin in it but it's quite a rare sensitivity or allergy so most people tolerate Aquaphor just fine another thing you can consider would be La Roche Posay secoplast bomb B5 this one has a B5 plus because I got this in Europe when I was in Paris but this is a great product you can get at your store but it has been selling out people on Tick Tock are using this on their acne lesions because it helps with wound healing but the ingredients in this don't actively fight acne it's more for healing has glycerin panthenol shea butter very soothing doesn't irritate my skin comes out as this paste you can put a small amount around your your cheekbones here you can layer it with your Aquaphor you can put this on first in Aquaphor Vaseline or CeraVe healing women over it but you see how it comes out as like this white paste but it does rub in well and then you get this kind of dewy finish here so totally fine to plan your face not comedogenic at all I like this one a lot this is a staple in my household ever since I discovered this let's talk about the most important thing sunscreen because sunlight will trigger acne rosacea flares and it's not good for those with sensitive skin because UV radiation will break your Skin Barrier up and make you more susceptible to allergens irritants and such I've talked about ltmd UV clear quite a bit on the channel this is nice because it has niacinamide in it and I like niacinamide containing sunscreens for those with rosacea and acne prone skin because it helps with the sebum but also inflammation comes in the tinted and non-tinted form tinted is great if you have hyperpigmentation as well this has zinc oxide and oxanoxate this is about 36 to 40 bucks though for 1.7 fluid ounces if you want a dupe something cheaper there's Dermatology this brand I've also talked about on the channel this is a Universal tinted moisturizer which is the dupe of the tinted Delta MD they're both SPF 46 they both have niacinamide this one though is a little over 20 bucks so much cheaper than this one and also 1.7 fluid ounces and comes out very nice lightweight one of my favorite sunscreens out so I'll just put a little bit here just to show you that it's a lighter tint very lightweight that it won't stain the inside of your mask as readily as the other tinted sunscreens out there very soothing good for sensitive skin moisturizing as well has some hyaluronic acid to help hydrate so I like this one a lot now in terms of other sunscreens besides tint you want to hide redness because this can help how you redness pretty well these lighter tinted sunscreens you can go for a Green Tinted sunscreen like Dr jar Dr jart sico pearline they have the color correcting cream with SPF or their tiger grass camel drops with SPF 44 this one's really nice almost looks like a matcha colored sunscreen here guess I'm running out but it's a nice one it's good to have Green Tinted products when you have rosacea because the green will help mask your read very well and you don't look green you don't look like the Hulk after it rubs in really well and hides so if you get a little redness around your nose you can put that sunscreen there Dr jard is a little bit more expensive but I say it's totally worth the price you got the zika in it which is soothing anti-inflammatory zika's really taken off recently and this is like K Beauty brand especially in the K Beauty World cintella asiatica has really taken off and it's very soothing so great for those with rosacea I'd say wear your sunscreen every day reapply especially if you're Outdoors reapply every couple hours if you're gonna get sweaty or exercise jump in the pool any kind of water activity you want to reapply every 40 to 60 minutes because your sunscreen will wash off pretty readily even if it's water resistant you got to reapply quite frequently if you're indoors and you're not by any window just wear your sunscreen in the morning before leaving the household and that should last you for the day if you are by a window glass though you should be technically reapplying every couple of hours because UVA will still come through the window glass and deactivate your sunscreen within a couple of hours okay so I hope this video helpful I had a lot of fun talking to you guys again about skin care and things you can do at home before you see me because a lot of times we have to prescribe prescription topical medicines or even oral medications for acne rosacea or rosacea and sometimes even do v-beam or pulse die laser for the redness the broken blood vessels we call pelandictasias see your dermatologist to talk about how to layer your prescription medicines and what medicines could work with your skin care products because we want them to interact and cause irritation as you know like we talked about it's a chronic condition without a cure so it's an ongoing battle and sometimes it's trial and error and azelic acid might work for one person and it might not work for the other patient so taking things slow trial and error being patient and not adding too many things at once taking things one step at a time okay so please hit the like button please subscribe to the Channel please share with your friends with sensitive skin and I'll see you guys for the next video guys okay take care peace foreign",

        "published_at": "2023-07-09T14:30:28Z",
        "transcript": "kind of feel like I'm the poster child for the benefits of azoleic acid it literally has done for my skin what no other skincare ingredient or product has done and that is keeping my rosacea and inflammatory skin at Bay just look at how my skin has struggled with rosacea over the years and look at it now I have been using over-the-counter azoleic acid skin care products for the last few years and I've already done videos on some of my favorite products so I'll link those at the end of this video and also in the description box below I'm not really going to go into that today what I'm going to do is answer the question I get repeatedly asked here on YouTube over on Tick Tock and Instagram and that is how do I layer azelaic acid effectively in my skincare routine so just a very brief overview of azoleic acid and its benefits to the skin if you're new to this particular ingredient azelic acid is a naturally occurring and skin identical ingredient just meaning that it is already present in our skin so known terosinase inhibitor which is responsible for producing melanin in the skin skin which gives color to our skin which is why as an ingredient azelic acid is great to Target hyperpigmentation issues and also melasma it also has exfoliating properties it is not an aha or an alpha hydroxy so it doesn't perform exactly the same as glycolic acid or lactic acid but it can help to smooth out your skin tone and even out your texture basically a gentle option that can even suit sensitive skin types but the greatest benefit for me has been its antimicrobial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties this is what makes it ideal for rosacea and acne prone skin helping to calm and soothe and reduce the inflammation Associated redness and pimples this is why I turned to this ingredient in the first place because I have struggled for years with the side effects of rosacea my skin is combination it's sensitive from rosacea prone it also tends to be dehydrated and when my rosacea flares It's My Skin Barrier that is very much impaired some of my triggers I know and recognize and others I don't even know what they are overdoing things in my skincare routine is definitely a trigger because if I compromise my barrier by using too many active ingredients all at once or things that are too strong for my skin will set my rosacea on fire drinking red wine I hate that one because I actually like drinking red wine and the Sun is one of my biggest triggers so I try to mitigate those wrists as best I can I wear a sunscreen I focus on my skincare routine and really focus on maintaining My Skin Barrier and I limit the amount of red wine that I drink the regular use of azelaic acid just simply cannot be understated for me when I put together my morning and evening skincare routine I just follow a very simple philosophy and that is maintain and prioritize My Skin Barrier at all costs so that means being flexible with my routines if my skin is in a compromised State I will adjust my skincare routines to be simply hydrating and really focus on that barrier repair but if my skin skin is in good health like it is right now in the morning I like to prioritize a vitamin C because I want the well-aging benefits associated with it and in the evening I sort of revolve my routines around the regular use of a retinoid using acid exfoliation limited just because of my skin and hydrating skin care so how does azoleic acid fit into all of that it's quite simple really let's start with the morning azoleic acid and vitamin C actually do pair very well together I say that but that is also with a bit of a caveat vitamin C is an ingredient that lots of people are irritated with that sounds like I'm saying oh vitamin C you're pissing me off today A lot of people are irritated by vitamin C that doesn't even sound any better A lot of people have irritation on their skin when they use vitamin C I think that makes sense but if you use vitamin C regularly and love to gain the benefits from it then pairing an azaleaic acid with that works really well try it on its own to see that you have no issues with the product and then try pairing them together if you're good you're good for my morning routine I like to cleanse with water only it just works really well to maintain My Skin Barrier rather than using a cleanser I reserve that for my evening routine we'll talk about that in a moment I also like to tone my skin after cleansing and that's because toners these days are just packed full of nice hydrating ingredients and then I wait for my skin to dry before I apply my vitamin C serum then I apply my azoleic acid and then I apply a moisturizer and then a sunscreen and that is my morning routine I tend to follow the philosophy of thinnest consistency of products to thickest consistency of products but I do make exceptions the azaleaic acid that I'm currently using is a prescription strength this is a 15 azaleaic acid it does have a creamy texture so in terms of texture it sort of sits well in my skincare routine at that point this is a 15 azaleaic acid most over-the-counter products are going to be under 15 and can range anywhere from three up to 10 percent is normally what I see just showing you the texture here it really sinks into the skin quite nicely but don't always believe that more equals more over-the-counter options have shown to be very efficacious as well even in a range from three to five percent I've seen lots of people say that azelic acid does better after some of your active ingredients in your skincare routine but if the azelaic acid you're using is a much thinner consistency you could put it earlier in your routine if you wish I don't really know that there is a true hard and fast rule on that but I've been doing it this way for a couple of years and it seems to be really working for my skin so there's your anecdotal evidence at least from me I love that vitamin C and azelic acid pair so well together because I can really combine all the well-aging benefits that I'm also trying to Target in my skin combined with what I need to support my rosacea azelic acid can have some side effects for some people including dryness and flaky skin some people find that it tingles or stings a bit upon application I haven't had that experience and perhaps it's because I did a slow introduction when I introduced it initially when I started using over-the-counter osceolaic acids I was only using it once per day in my skincare routine when I moved up to the prescription strength my doctor recommended that I use it twice in my skincare routine so both morning and evening that's particular to my needs so of course if you're using a prescription strength azolacic acid you'll be in consultation with your medical professional moving into my evening routines I'm just going to explain a few of the routines that I sprinkle throughout the week starting with a hydrating skincare routine I usually do a routine like this every other day that I'm not using a retinoid or an alpha hydroxy acid it gives my skin the chance to repair itself and I find it's a really good strategy for my rosacea skin and prioritizing my skin barrier as much as I want the benefits of well-aging products and retinoids in particular throughout the week in my skin skincare routine for me it just doesn't work so well that way because my skin will get easily compromised and then I'm back to square one let me know in the comments if you're able to use a retinoid every day or if you're kind of like me and have to balance it out with other routines just to be sure that you're not damaging Your Skin Barrier if I'm doing a simple hydrating skincare routine I would double cleanse my skin that's using an oil cleansing balm or a micellar water to remove all the dirt oil makeup sunscreen debris from my face followed up with a water-based cleanser again I would apply a toner to my damp skin after cleansing then I would follow up with my hydrating serum or serums I like to use face oils and then a moisturizer on the evenings that I use an alpha hydroxy acid I do not use a nasolic acid in the same routine Alpha hydroxy acids for me are already borderline irritating for my skin that routine I need to hold kind of sacred and be very very careful because overdoing it with an acid can easily set my rosacea on fire so when I do that skincare routine for me it's once a week and I get great results from doing it that way so I really don't need to do it every single day but I know some people like to and can double cleanse apply my toner apply my Alpha hydroxy to dry skin and then follow up with a face oil and moisturizer and that's it as for a BHA or a beta hydroxy acid I do the same thing I typically use a BHA on its own once per week and so I keep my azulaic acid out of that routine however when acelic acid is formulated with a BHA salicylic acid then it's no problem and this one is really great from Paula's choices they're 10 azoleic acid booster formulated together with salicylic acid a lot of the times people get hung up on what can and cannot be paired together when it's formulated together all of those things are taken into consideration it's when you're layering products yourself acting like a little cosmetic chemist in your bathroom which I love to do that is when you can be at risk or an increased risk of irritation because there's no formulation in there helping those two ingredients to work synergistically together and reducing the level of irritation but could you layer them together yes if your skin can tolerate it you can that's the beauty of azelic acid it fits in well with other skin care products very effectively for my retinoid night I have found no issue with layering azelic acid in my retinoid together I typically use a retinaldehyde and if you don't know what that is or anything about the retinoid family don't worry I've done a video explaining everything there is to know about retinoids because I was so confused when I first started using them I'll link that at the end of this video and in the description box below for you as well so for that routine I would double cleanse tone my skin apply my retinol to dry skin apply my osceolaic acid face oil and moisturizer I hope this video has helped you understand how I put together my skincare routines using azoleic acid and for me prioritizing it in both my evening and morning skincare routines be sure to drop your azelic acid questions comments and experiences in the comments section below if you haven't already watched these videos be sure to watch them next and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

H: I try to think about it\u00a0\nlike does this ingredient\u00a0\u00a0 give back to my skin or does it take from it M: what are some of your\u00a0\nfavorites for calming down\u00a0\u00a0 irritated skin and supporting your skin barrier? H: panthenol glycerin and hyaluronic acid so\u00a0\nthose are hydrating panthenol's a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 soothing as well niacinamide everyone's fave\u00a0\nbut not too much like five percent not 10 or 20 and then there's barrier support so we\u00a0\nhave ceramides cholesterol or you might\u00a0\u00a0 see phytosphingosine so that's a lipid\u00a0\nyou find in the outer layer of your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and it helps to give back to your skin\u00a0\nthose lipids that it's mainly missing then we have soothing ingredients so my faves\u00a0\u00a0 are definitely oat and also centella so\u00a0\n\"cica\" madecassoside and copper peptide M: so moving on to specific products I don't know if I told you this but your\u00a0\nserum actually made me realize how there\u00a0\u00a0 were lots of actives for irritated skin because\u00a0\nI used your serum and it was lovely on my skin and then I looked at the ingredients\u00a0\nlist and there was so much stuff in there so side note I did not invite Hannah onto this\u00a0\nvideo because she's my friend and I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 plug her serum we are going to talk about other\u00a0\nproducts but this was like a revelation to me so the serum is water-based and most of the\u00a0\ntime water-based serums really sting when my\u00a0\u00a0 skin barrier is compromised and this did not\u00a0\nit just felt so lovely so my mind was blown H: I feel like the oat is doing\u00a0\na lot of the lifting there my skin was stressed out while we were\u00a0\nworking on it so it was good for me to\u00a0\u00a0 test but what I wanted was something\u00a0\nthat would feel calming on contact I definitely did feel like there was a gap\u00a0\nthat was not much you could get especially\u00a0\u00a0 in Australia that would hydrate calm and support\u00a0\nyour barrier that didn't feel like thick and balmy M: I really love how lightweight\u00a0\nit is and how well it layers and\u00a0\u00a0 like just the fact that there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market I've been using this a few times\u00a0\na week even when my skin isn't\u00a0\u00a0 that irritated because it just\u00a0\nfits into my routine so nicely M: what are your other favorite\u00a0\nproducts for when your skin's irritated? H: I really like the la roche\u00a0\nposay cicaplast sheet masks you\u00a0\u00a0 put it on your face and it just\u00a0\nfeels calm it's hydrated it's\u00a0\u00a0 the best even after treatments you\u00a0\nknow when your skin feels really hot M: so I personally just don't really enjoy sheet\u00a0\nmasks because I don't like the feeling of them\u00a0\u00a0 sliding down my face so I love the cicaplast baume\u00a0\nB5 which is getting reformulated to the B5 plus I picked up one up in Europe and so far\u00a0\nit seems to be pretty similar on my skin\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a little bit lighter but I have\u00a0\nheard different things from other people a lot of people have told me that they really\u00a0\u00a0 like the cicaplast serum as well but I\u00a0\nhaven't tried that enough to really say there are a lot of other centella products that\u00a0\nare formulated for this sort of skin recovery\u00a0\u00a0 phase as well from brands like bioderma\u00a0\nand there's quite a few in K Beauty too H: I quite like NIOD's copper\u00a0\npeptide but the lipid which is\u00a0\u00a0 a sort of gel it's great because\u00a0\nsort of a one and done PM routine Beauty Bay make this moisturizer that's oat\u00a0\u00a0 it's called Thirst Class it's kind of a\u00a0\nbit richer so I would use it in winter M: yeah I think oat is just really underrated I\u00a0\nused to make this DIY oat mask back in the day\u00a0\u00a0 that was just ground up oatmeal mixed with\u00a0\nwater and I would just slap it on my skin it has a lot of hydrating actives and\u00a0\navenanthramides which are really soothing H: if you're fancy the Cosmetics\u00a0\n27 baume 27 which is sort of like\u00a0\u00a0 a healing oil balm really beautiful it\u00a0\nhas essential oils but they're chamomile\u00a0\u00a0 calendula those calming ones not the\u00a0\nhectic lavender or anything like that laneige cream skin beautiful\u00a0\ndoesn't have many ingredients M: I really love that one too\u00a0\nit's really lightweight and\u00a0\u00a0 less ingredients just cuts down\u00a0\nthat chance of skin reactions along the same lines with less\u00a0\ningredients but a bit heavier\u00a0\u00a0 there's also Vaseline and Aquaphor\u00a0\nwhich is mostly just petroleum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 and they're water free so there's\u00a0\nlike a lot less chance of stinging there's also CeraVe healing ointment\u00a0\nand the QV sting free ointment which\u00a0\u00a0 is like the Australian version of that\u00a0\nand they both have ceramides in them too I also really like using face oils\u00a0\nwhen I have that compromised skin\u00a0\u00a0 barrier because of the lack of water\u00a0\nit just doesn't tend to sting as much H: the paula's choice advanced\u00a0\nreplenishing toner I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 reminds me of laneige cream skin only\u00a0\nit's packed with antioxidants as well\u00a0\u00a0 so it can almost be your am serum\u00a0\nif you want a bunch of antioxidants I quite like my LED mask as well so I\u00a0\nhave one that's red and near infrared I\u00a0\u00a0 find when I use it regularly my skin is just\u00a0\nmore resilient and can tolerate more things I get a little bit tired in\u00a0\nthe evening so you just put\u00a0\u00a0 it on and then you've done skincare\u00a0\nand it's one less layer on your face M: I mentioned before that you have to avoid\u00a0\nretinoids exfoliants and vitamin C but there\u00a0\u00a0 are gentler versions of those so what is your\u00a0\npolicy on using these when your skin's irritated? H: it really depends for me on how irritated my\u00a0\u00a0 skin is but but I do have some\u00a0\ngentler versions of my actives la roche C10 is an example that\u00a0\none has 10% vitamin C but also\u00a0\u00a0 their neurosensine peptide and a\u00a0\nbit of salicylic acid so I have\u00a0\u00a0 literally never had an issue with that\u00a0\nproduct and I have issues with vitamin C and if I wanted a retinoid the kiehls\u00a0\nmicrodose it's enough to have an effect\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not enough to cause any issues so\u00a0\nthat's also a perfect beginner retinoid in\u00a0\u00a0 general and it has ceramides to\u00a0\nreplenish your skin as it works M: I also really like using derivatives of\u00a0\nvitamin C and A where my skin's irritated\u00a0\u00a0 because while there is less evidence\u00a0\nfor them working they are a lot gentler which I guess could be because they're not working\u00a0\nas well but it is like a nice fallback option my favorite less irritating derivatives for\u00a0\nvitamin C are ascorbyl glucoside magnesium\u00a0\u00a0 ascorbyl phosphate and thda or\u00a0\natip which are the same thing and for vitamin A I like granactive retinoid for gentle chemical exfoliation I like\u00a0\nusing polyhydroxy acids although I do\u00a0\u00a0 also sometimes use a very small amount of\u00a0\nsalicylic acid since it can be soothing but\u00a0\u00a0 you do have to be pretty careful because\u00a0\na lot of the formulas are quite harsh M: so one question I get asked a lot is\u00a0\nhow long do you generally have to wait\u00a0\u00a0 for your barrier to fix itself before\u00a0\nyou can go back to your usual products H: I am getting pretty good at repairing mine\u00a0\u00a0 and recognizing the signs before I\u00a0\ntruly obliterate it so a week or two recently I had a facial where it was an enzyme\u00a0\nexfoliant and it was like a bit scrubby and\u00a0\u00a0 I felt a bit tingly around the mouth I\u00a0\nthought it would be fine it wasn't fine the next few days it was tingly and so I\u00a0\njust cut the actives for about two weeks previous times has taken me three months M: that is so long yeah I think it is just a lot easier to not\u00a0\nmess up your skin barrier in the first place the longest my skin has taken is probably a week\u00a0\u00a0 or two but it depends a lot\u00a0\non the type of irritation so with perioral dermatitis\u00a0\nusually that is maybe a day or two if my nose is peeling off after a cold\u00a0\nthen that will usually be over a week now with cleansers which ones\u00a0\ndo you like for irritated skin? H: I like to use fragrance free cleanses and\u00a0\nit's because if your barrier is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 compromised then things get in further and so\u00a0\nthey wouldn't normally irritate you but they can I like avene extremely gentle cleanser\u00a0\nI like biologique recherche lait u that\u00a0\u00a0 is the one that's for oily skin but it's a cream and I like a really soft washcloth so like\u00a0\nthat really flammable fluffy polyester M: I also like fragrance free\u00a0\ncleansers where my skin's irritated some of my favorites are from geek\u00a0\nand gorgeous hada labo and bondi sands all of those don't really strip\u00a0\nskin and like you said they have\u00a0\u00a0 moisturising ingredients\u00a0\nthat give back to the skin I also really like using bioderma micellar\u00a0\nwater with soft reusable cotton rounds the bioderma was specifically designed and tested\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin and reusable\u00a0\ncotton rounds are just really soft M: now we are Australians so of course\u00a0\nwe have to talk about sun protection what is your approach when your skin's irritated? H: there are a couple of sunscreens\u00a0\nI know not to use because I can feel\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit spicy on the cheeks if my\u00a0\nskin is irritated but generally I will\u00a0\u00a0 look for one that is formulated for sensitive skin I really like those European pharmacy\u00a0\nbrands ends that cater to this type of skin M: yeah I think there is this sort of\u00a0\nassumption that you have to use zinc\u00a0\u00a0 oxide if your skin's irritated but\u00a0\nsometimes that's not the best option\u00a0\u00a0 and newer sunscreen filters\u00a0\ncan be really non-irritating if you go into like a French pharmacy\u00a0\nyou'll see that all of their sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin sunscreens are actually all chemical\u00a0\nsunscreens they have those newer filters some people actually find zinc oxide\u00a0\nmore irritating because it is drying\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite irritating when you're\u00a0\nrubbing it in because it's so thick\u00a0\u00a0 and sticky and also just trying to\u00a0\nget it off with cleanser at the end on top of that they're not always truly free\u00a0\nfrom chemical sunscreens I've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this before but there are these SPF boosters\u00a0\nthat are in a lot of mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\u00a0 they have almost identical properties to a\u00a0\nlot of properly approved chemical sunscreens I've actually talked to quite a few\u00a0\npeople now who have told me that they\u00a0\u00a0 react to some mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\nnot others and then they checked and\u00a0\u00a0 they saw that the ones that they do\u00a0\nreact to have butyloctyl salicylate M: right what other tips and tricks\u00a0\ndo you have for irritated skin? H: I think a lot of people don't know\u00a0\nthat your skin it exfoliates itself right it's called desquamation and it does that\u00a0\nbetter when it is adequately hydrated so\u00a0\u00a0 I would always try to hydrate my\u00a0\nskin before I try to exfoliate it if it's flaking or something\u00a0\nlike that and you might find\u00a0\u00a0 that the flakes take care of themselves that way I also really like doing several\u00a0\nlayers of one toner putting several\u00a0\u00a0 layers of one product on is better\u00a0\nthan putting four or five different\u00a0\u00a0 products right less opportunity\u00a0\nto upset your skin freak it out M: I also find that with flaky skin\u00a0\nif I have to get rid of them before\u00a0\u00a0 putting on makeup then I will wet my\u00a0\nskin and use a peeling gel very very\u00a0\u00a0 carefully and just buff in tiny circles\u00a0\nand that seems to do the least damage but that is like a really emergency sort\u00a0\nof thing I wouldn't recommend doing that\u00a0\u00a0 regularly when your skin is compromised because\u00a0\nthe hydration technique is just so much safer M: you also gave me some really good tips for\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis which is a newer issue for me it's a red rash that comes up around\u00a0\nyour mouth and near the sides of your\u00a0\u00a0 nose and it's been coming up\u00a0\nmore because of mask wearing the extra humidity can lead to an impaired barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and imbalance microbes and that can\u00a0\ncontribute to perioral dermatitis so I've had to change a few things when it flares\u00a0\u00a0 up like adding a cleanser in the\u00a0\nmorning which I don't usually do when my skin is happy then extra\u00a0\ncleansing tends to mess it up more\u00a0\u00a0 and dehydrate my skin but when that\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis is flaring then\u00a0\u00a0 my skin's already messed up so cleansing\u00a0\nactually takes it back towards happy M: do you have any other tips? H: if you think it might be perioral\u00a0\ndermatitis never put steroids on it\u00a0\u00a0 that's a Dr Cara-ism it's my beloved dermatologist perioral dermatitis it's like imbalanced\u00a0\nmicrobiome but also it can happen from\u00a0\u00a0 steroid withdrawal because the steroids\u00a0\nput your immune system to sleep a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit your immune system was there sort\u00a0\nof keeping the microbiome in check M: speaking of microbiome I found that I\u00a0\nsometimes get very superficial folliculitis\u00a0\u00a0 on my body when my skin gets irritated\u00a0\nso like after exercising and I'm sweaty\u00a0\u00a0 and my clothes have been rubbing in my\u00a0\narmpits and in like my crotchal region and it's usually worse when I'm a bit\u00a0\nrun down from stress and lack of sleep basically this is when bacteria infect your hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles and you get red bumps with pus\u00a0\nthat look like shallow inflamed pimples for these I like to use a benzoyl\u00a0\nperoxide cleanser most of these are\u00a0\u00a0 meant for the face but dermatologists have been\u00a0\u00a0 recommending it for body folliculitis too\u00a0\nand it's been working really well for me I use it right after I exercise\u00a0\nand also when I'm having a flare\u00a0\u00a0 and just also not marinating\u00a0\nin sweaty clothes helps a lot but if it's really deep and painful\u00a0\nand not going away then definitely see\u00a0\u00a0 a doctor because you might need antibiotics or\u00a0\nsomething or it could be just not folliculitis M: now rosacea I get asked about this a lot and\u00a0\u00a0 it's a bit of a confusing condition\u00a0\nthat not a lot of people talk about so what is rosacea? H: rosacea is a chronic inflammatory\u00a0\nskin condition it's basically my\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist explained it to me as it's the blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels that are inflamed not the\u00a0\npores like you would have in acne you'll see visible blood vessels so those\u00a0\nlittle red ones are called telangiectasias\u00a0\u00a0 redness flushing so you'll see a symmetrical\u00a0\npattern of redness so mine comes and goes so you might get sort of a pimple like bump but it\u00a0\u00a0 won't be in the t-zone it will be around\u00a0\nthe cheeks and the nose in this pattern so it's like w zone not t-zone M: it gets confused a lot with acne and it\u00a0\ntends to show up from your late 20s onwards M: so how did you first\u00a0\nsuspect that you had rosacea? H: I was at an event and Dr Dennis\u00a0\nwas there and I said \"you know what\u00a0\u00a0 I'm always like flushing pink and red\u00a0\nthrough here sometimes through my cheeks what's going on? is that something I can treat?\" he's like \"well that's rosacea\" and I\u00a0\nwas like \"see ya\" I didn't want to know M: why should you actually\u00a0\nlook into managing rosacea? H: the thing about rosacea is that it progresses so you'll start with just the pink\u00a0\nand the flushing and maybe some\u00a0\u00a0 visible blood vessels around the nose\u00a0\nyou can get them in your cheeks too and then you'll start to get lesions\u00a0\nand you can also have it get into your\u00a0\u00a0 eyes and then it can progress\u00a0\nto thickened skin and swelling M: in terms of treating rosacea there\u00a0\nare over-the-counter options like\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid you should also\u00a0\nsee a dermatologist who has\u00a0\u00a0 experience with treating rosacea and\u00a0\nthey'll have other options available how else do you manage rosacea? H: Keeping on top of your skin barrier\u00a0\nand keeping that in check in place,\u00a0\u00a0 really supporting it is number one And avoiding triggers so you'll notice\u00a0\nwhen you start to flush from certain things the sun is a big one my skin hates the indoor heating - hates it alcohol some foods even spicy food is a big one\u00a0\u00a0 especially for like pale people\u00a0\nthat only eat meat and vegetables some medicines even do it your\u00a0\nskin care or makeup could do it M: I feel like in the skincare community we\u00a0\ntalk so much about acne but nowhere near as\u00a0\u00a0 much about rosacea so if any of this is\u00a0\nsounding familiar then you might want\u00a0\u00a0 to read up a bit on rosacea and\u00a0\nconsider getting it checked out I'll put some more resources in the\u00a0\ncaption and keep in mind that if you\u00a0\u00a0 have darker skin the redness will be harder to see I hope you enjoyed this nerdy chat if you did like the video to train the YouTube\u00a0\nalgorithm to give you more content like this also share any tips you have and leave\u00a0\nquestions for Hannah in the comments you can follow Hannah here she's also\u00a0\nwritten a great book and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 how much I'm getting out of it from all of my tabs I also have an ebook on skincare and I hope\u00a0\nthis video helps your skin be less grumpy at you",

        "transcript": "rosacea is a condition i commonly see in clinics so in this video we're going to talk about what is rosacea how to best treat it and i'm going to offer some of my skincare tips for those of you who suffer from rosacea hi my name is dr jenny liu i'm a board certified dermatologist in minneapolis and welcome to my youtube channel so what is rosacea rosaceae is a chronic and inflammatory skin condition often characterized by skin sensitivity along with a tendency to flush and look rosy and red but also may develop pimple like bumps especially along the central face so the cheeks the nose the chin and the forehead and that is a very big definition of rosacea because we know that rosacea have various different presentations in fact we even used to categorize rosacea into four subtypes we still do for more academic purposes but for when we are seeing a patient in clinic we don't use those subcategories to really treat the patient we treat based on the clinical findings and the symptoms because we know for most individuals with rosacea they'll often have kind of a collection of various different subtypes number one is called erythrometal tylangitatic and that is the redness the flushing that we often see like the cheeks the nose the chin sometimes it can be very severe and large broken visible blood vessels can be present sometimes awareness often will flare with certain triggers and those triggers are different for everyone but common things would be heat wind cold spicy food stress chocolate caffeine all the good stuff subtype two is papular pustular rosacea so this is more than kind of what they used to call adult acne even though it's not truly acne but often gets misdiagnosed or mistaken for acne will present it is these pink zit or pimple like bumps and sometimes even pustules often on the nose the cheeks and the chin the third time is called phymatis and this has to do with chronic inflammation and over growth of your oil glands essentially often will present as more like a bulbous skin bulbous nose and that's called rhinophyma with uneven surface and texture with dilated pore like appearance but that feminist change can also be seen of the forehead as well as the chin and lastly the fourth subtype of rosacea is ocular rosacea and yes you can definitely get rosacea in your eyes often these patients will have like a dry and gritty like sensation grading the sensation in the eye sometimes eyelid margins can get crusty they can get styes and the whiteness of their eye can look more red and injected as i mentioned earlier most individuals will have a spectrum of these conditions and well being having the type 1 and type 2 so the flushing the redness along with pimples being the most common presentation that we see so why does rosacea happen you know unfortunately we are still trying to elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea so we don't completely understand it however we do know that it is very common affects 60 million americans and we often see it in like in the late 20s and 30s not so much in their kids and teenagers tends to present in adulthood now genetics do play a role in rosacea we tend to see this running in families as far as what is happening underneath the skin we do know that there are certain things that we see in rosacea patients that we don't see in individuals who don't have rosacea so number one there is a defective skin barrier and that could be a reason why often rosacea patients will complain that their skin is more sensitive either to products or to the environmental triggers there is increased interest epidermal water loss so the inability of the skin to hold on to water and tend to be more dry flaky and dehydrated we also know that there is actually a decreased amount of lipid production of the stratum corneum in rosacea patients similar there tends to be a an immunogenic so pro-inflammatory response for some reason and the inflammation will generate a cascade of reactions leading to production of enzymes that will generate inflammation but also can degrade collagen and we think that inflammation in part is what's responsible for the redness and those pimples that we see in rosacea patients furthermore there is what we call a neurogenic dysregulation so hypersensitivity along with again that clinical presentation that we see of being more sensitive to certain triggers and lastly there tends to be a hyper reaction to an organism that lives in the oil glands so there is a mite called demodex mite that we see in six percent of the normal healthy population there are these little bugs that you can actually even scrape out of the skin and put on a slide and clinic sometimes we'll do this and you can see these little prolly little critters and it's like i can't believe this just came out of my skin but in rosacea patients we found that there tends to be a higher density but not only is it the presence of these mites but we think in abnormal response to these mites is what is associated with the more popular and postular variant of rosacea now as mentioned earlier there can be common triggers for individual rosacea but one of the biggest risk factors is ultraviolet radiation we know that uv radiation is pro-inflammatory damages dna generates inflammatory response reactive estrogen cdc's and also upregulates all these inflammatory cytokines that already are pre-existing in rosacea patients that will often make that worse which is why it is super important to be doing thorough and diligent sun protection on a regular basis furthermore we know that in individuals who are more red and have dilated and broken blood vessels the sun often will make that worse so how we treat rosacea really depends on the presentation so if it's redness often lasers avoiding triggers certain prescription topicals can be helpful at temporarily reducing the amount of redness and obviously camouflaging is helpful when it comes to the papules or the pustules acne like bumps often prescription topicals and sometimes even oral medications are necessary for really severe cases i mentioned earlier oral antibiotics and sometimes even oral retinoids are used for severe cases but those overgrowth of sebaceous glands laser and certain type of procedures can be helpful next i'm going to offer some tips for general skin care and some of my personal favorite skin care products that i recommend for my rosacea patients the most important thing is if you do have rosacea is to see your dermatologist because like i said often prescription medications are really going to be helpful to help your rosacea get under control but nevertheless proper skincare is still going to be really really important and really the foundation as always you want to test out any products before using them and when it comes to skincare gentle is the way to go and less is more i recommend just a good gentle cleanser once or twice a day from cerave their hydrating cleanser vana cream facial cleanser is another really good one just find one that is going to be effective but not over strip your skin's natural oil now moisturizers are really going to be the key at helping to hydrate moisturize prevent trans epidermal water loss and really help to repair your skin barrier one of my favorite products is the one from cetaphil their redness relief night moisturizer this is very calming and soothing it contains ceramides niacinamide and shea butter and it's just a really good moisturizer and this is one of you that i have found that when my skin is like say recovering from a chemical peel and tends to be more sensitive it will not burn and has never burned my skin similarly another one that i personally love and use all the time is the two layering ultra moisturizing cream from la roche posay this is a thicker moisturizer contains glycerin thermal spring water shea butter and the neurosensing which is a peptide that they've actually done clinical studies on using this product on rosacea patients and has been found to have an anti-inflammatory and calming effects so this is one that i also really love one more moisturizer that i like especially to spot trace certain really irritated areas is the event sickle fades restorative cream and this is a zinc based zinc is really helpful for repairing skin it's used a lot in healing this is definitely kind of more white and pasty thick enough to even use on chapped lips if you need again something that can be really helpful soothing to the skin pretty thick so probably would use as needed to spot treat definitely can use it all over your face but i find that to be too a little bit too sick and heavy been occlusive and for those who want a lighter moisturizer either to use in the morning or if you have more oily skin the two that i've always recommended to my patients are one from cerave their pm facial moisturizer this is great i mean it says pm but it's lightweight it's oil free great to use under sunscreen in the morning in fact i do that sometimes as well as the laura's procedure and double facial moisturizer both of these are really helpful they're both oil free fast absorbing both contain ceramides and nice cinnamon that's gonna be helping to repair skin barrier and soothing so it's really just like a toss up i honestly love both and kind of will rotate through both of them depending on my mood now one last product that i have really been liking when my skin is just super sensitive is using an overnight sleeping mask one that i found to be really soothing and calming is the one from skin fix the redness relief overnight sleeping mask and this contains honey peptides and other calming ingredients and you wear it like a sleeping mask so you would wear it over your moisturizer and you will sleep in that it really helps to hydrate the skin repair the skin barrier and it's just very soothing and it really feels really good when you put it on your skin and it's kind of formulated for those with more sensitive red and rosacea prone skin so i would love to know if you've tried this please comment below and let me know what you think now i cannot finish off a rosacea video without talking and stressing the importance of wearing sunscreen i've talked about various types of my favorite sunscreens in my previous video and i will link some of my favorites that i think are well suited for rosacea prone skin down below in the description box but sunscreen is one of those no products that the best one is the one that you like enough that works well for your skin that you will remember and want to wear on a daily basis in general rosacea patients tend to tolerate mineral based sunscreen a little bit better just because often with this chemical sunscreen it can be more irritating and can burn but i have found a handful of mario's tissue patients including my skin that tends to be sensitive can tolerate certain types of chemical sunscreens it really all depends on the formulation here is where you have to try you want to make sure you're putting on enough most people under apply so at least a teaspoon for your head and neck reapply it throughout the day and this is really important because we do know that ultraviolet radiation come through windows and most of us because we under apply and your sunscreen gets rubbed off throughout the day that is going to make a huge difference when it comes to protecting your skin so really make sure that you are reapplying using the proper amount so those are some of my favorite skincare recommendations i hope you guys found this video helpful and let me know if you have rosacea if you have tried any of these products that i've recommended i'd love to hear what you think about them similarly if you have a holy grail product that i did not mention today comment below because i would love to try them out myself and hopefully recommend them to my patients as well if you enjoy watching this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel again you can follow me on my various social media accounts until next time thanks

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea the first one is actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big

        "transcript": "now one of the most difficult things about rosacea is finding skin care that works for you and not against you so often the wrong thing can be the actual cause of a flare so today's video is all about giving you that essential tool kit so you have all the right ingredients in your skincare routine to help you tame the flames of rosacea now make sure you stay right to the very end because i'll be sharing my favorite ingredient last so the first ingredients i want to talk about are in fact spf filters because in my mind there is no skin care routine for rosacea that isn't underpinned by effective sun protection and that's because of the huge role that uva plays in rosacea and potentially triggering disease so when it comes to rosacea i am a fan of mineral filters meaning zinc oxide and titanium dioxide they just tend to do a better job less irritating great coverage and as a bonus i think that the right mineral sunscreen can actually really brighten the skin helping mask redness and serving as a great base for makeup now i i'm really dependent on gossamer tint one for that reason not only does it allow me to have the old day where i don't wear any makeup at all bar a little bit of concealer under my eyes because it evens out my complexion masking a little bit of that redness but also just delivering a really kind of glass skin glow and that's because of the way zinc and titanium look on the skin there's a reason why titanium dioxide is a component of many foundations but great for sensitive skin um great post procedure as well this is the kind of sunscreen we use after laser treatments and the like um and really i think a foundation when it comes to treating rosacea so when it comes to active rosacea the topical ingredient i find most helpful nowadays is actually something called ivamectin or sulantra on prescription something you'd have to get through your gp or dermatologist i just find it to be the most helpful thing when someone is undergoing a spotty flare some flare in the popular postular phase tends to be the thing that brings it under control most effectively and i also really like how it's formulated the base of this particular active is really soothing and kind and generally well tolerated in rosacea prime skin so i will typically use that at night to calm a flare sometimes in conjunction with oral antibiotics and over time typically i will transition from using cilantro maybe after six weeks maybe after 12 into using something else that is more about disease prevention so cilantro i reserve for the active spotty flares then coming on to more traditionally anti-inflammatory ingredients that we use in skin care niacinamide is something that i like a lot in those who are rosacea prone now it's often found in moisturizers like an hour of flawless moisturizer it's present at five percent just as it's in revival mask at 10 and i do think it's worth considering as an active and not just a moisturizing ingredient somebody actually made this point in one of our testimonials on the website i thought you know it's a good point i think it can easily get sort of lumped in with other ingredients like ceramides but in its own right niacinamide is an active not only does it help support barrier function increasing skin's own production of ceramides but it also helps stimulate collagen production it helps improve hyperpigmentation and you know it's anti-inflammatory so therefore potentially helpful with active papules and pustules in its own right but just like any active it can be something that causes irritation so always introduce new active ingredients even if they're in a moisturizer with care but typically those who've got redness prone skin find this to be really helpful then we come on to retinoids which can be a tricky topic in context of rosacea however when the timing is right i think they are profoundly useful so the timing is not right if you are having an active inflammatory flare the timing is worth considering if things are calm and we're really just looking to increase the density of the dermis which is something that i think given that we know that rosacea occurs in light-eyed light-skinned individuals who are potentially um exposed to uva as a consequence of you know everyday life i think it's really important to think about this as part of a holistic approach to managing rosacea um so timing has to be right the ingredient type has to be right so i'm not talking about going full tilt with tretinoin 0.05 i'm talking about dipping your toe in the water when things are calm to see if your skin will get on board now in the non-prescription space that might be something like granactive retinoid or retinaldehyde and on the prescription side of things i often use a dappling or differin cream not gel to test the waters to see if somebody is actually going to respond and when people do respond they respond well i mean as somebody with erythematology which can't even say it today erythematologic rosacea myself um i have definitely had to tread carefully when it comes to using a retinoid in my skin but it's necessary in terms of the general health and well-being so i'm just respectful and then saving the best to last azelaic acid i don't think i can even think of a single rosacea patient who doesn't rely on azelaic acid as part of their ongoing strategy for their rosacea maintenance and again i count myself in that azolic acid is just so helpful in rosacea because of its ability to down regulate that over enthusiastic inflammatory response part of what we call the innate immune system which when it's challenged by the external environment you know whether it's weather related whether it's things that we put on it or you know whether it's triggered by the things that we ingest azelaic acid just dials it down really nicely and the great thing is there is now you know a proliferation of azelaic acid-base products on the market so we can get on prescription phonation skinner in different percentages but essentially delivering the same amount of ingredient into the skin and then over the counter we have good old brightly serum with 10 azelaic acid and some other active ingredients alongside it including niacinamide and you know the ordinary has a really affordable version too so azolic acid i've talked about it at length before but i think for the rosacea sufferer particularly those who are concerned about staying fresh um it has additional benefits it's good for pigmentation it's good for texture it's a powerful antioxidant it's so versatile that you know as i've said many times before there has to be a really good reason for it not to be in the mix i've not mentioned metronidazole which it has historically been one of the antibiotic topicals that we use in rosacea i have to say that in my practice i have now evolved to almost exclusively using cilantro and azelaic acid information or skin or in format almost exclusively i just don't tend to use metronidazole topically at all anymore in part because the physical nature of those preparations often wasn't something that patients enjoy using they're often quite unpleasant in terms of the way they would layer on the skin but i just don't find them to be as effective but worth mentioning because if it's something that has worked for you and you get on with the preparations available that's you know metro gel or rosex cream then absolutely fine to keep going they are a recognized part of the treatment toolkit so i hope by now you're starting to feel like you have a bit more control over your rosacea you know where to turn to in terms of getting the right ingredients to tackle it and i'm going to be doing another couple of videos in this series um so you have a really complete bank of knowledge um when it comes to the nuances of dealing with rosacea and know that i'm with you on this journey it's something that i have you know honed my kind of skin care practices over the years to ensure that i get the best possible result in terms of managing my own tendency towards rosacea um so i hope it was helpful please do share this content with anybody who needs to know more about dealing with rosacea and i'll see you guys again soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "hyperpigmentation is a really common skin concern and it can be so tricky to treat because pigmentation is stubborn so i'm going to share with you some of my favorite ingredients and skincare products that you can use at home to help with hyperpigmentation if you're new i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and to find products that work for you if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before we get into the treatments for hyperpigmentation let's spend a minute talking about what hyperpigmentation actually is and what causes it hyperpigmentation generally refers to the abnormal or irregular overproduction of pigment in the skin that results in skin darkening and the pigment that is over produced is melanin melanin is what gives all of our skin color and we all have a different amount of baseline melanin and when that melanin production is revved up and deposited in the skin we get hyperpigmentation now the causes of hyperpigmentation are incredibly broad and far-reaching some of them include medications certain medical conditions pregnancy or other shifts in your hormones sun and sun damage of course allergies and inflammation so the causes of hyperpigmentation can be kind of tricky to figure out from person to person and everyone's trigger might be a little bit different but i'll kind of talk you through some of the most common types of hyperpigmentation that i see in my practice and that a lot of people ask me about by far and away the most common type of hyperpigmentation i see is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or pih is exactly what it sounds like excess pigment in the skin after the skin has been inflamed and some of the most common inflammatory triggers of pih are things like acne bug bites and little scrapes so if you've ever had an acne mark that maybe you picked or even didn't pick and then a few days later that acne bump has resolved but it has left a dark mark in its place that's pih another common cause of hyperpigmentation is melasma and melasma is sort of the symmetrical distribution of hyperpigmented or darker patches on the face like the upper lip the cheeks the forehead it can also happen on the arms it definitely affects women way more than it affects men and actually if you want a video on melasma let me know because i could talk about it forever but definitely common cause of hyperpigmentation and then one thing that i wouldn't technically file under the category of hyperpigmentation but is often discussed when hyperpigmentation is brought up are sunspots also known as solar lentigines or sun freckles sometimes they're called liver spots even though they have absolutely nothing to do with your liver but these are essentially just brown patches or little growths on the skin that show up in sun exposed areas over your lifetime this all being said there are still many many more types of hyperpigmentation so if you're noticing darkening on your skin and it doesn't seem to fall into any of the categories that i just brought up it might be a good idea to check in with a dermatologist to make sure you're on the right track for treatment before you begin any interventions now when it comes to treating hyperpigmentation the real strategy here is to pick ingredients or products with ingredients that disrupt the pathway of melanin distribution and production within the skin so you need to either disrupt some type of enzyme that creates the pigment or disrupts some mechanism that distributes that pigment throughout the skin in order to improve hyperpigmentation another thing to keep in mind is that hyperpigmentation is notoriously tricky to treat pigmentation is just super stubborn so oftentimes you need multiple effective ingredients used for a long period of time consistently to see improvement it's also important to note that not all hyperpigmentation is going to be amenable to improvement with just at home skincare sometimes you need chemical peels or lasers or other technologies to intervene to see a big improvement and the last thing i want to note and i'm not saying this to be negative or discouraging but as a dermatologist i think it's very important for me to convey the fact that not all hyperpigmentation can be completely eliminated there are some forms of hyperpigmentation that are so stubborn and we just don't have the technology yet to completely get rid of it on some people's skin all right i think i've covered all my bases now so let's get into treatment and the products i recommend let's start off with the category of antioxidants because these play both a preventative role in hyperpigmentation as well as a treatment rule the main purpose of antioxidants is to protect our skin they work by neutralizing a damaging molecule that shows up in our skin called oxygen free radicals and those oxygen free radicals can be generated from environmental aggressors like pollution and excessive uv light as well as our normal cellular metabolic functions now in addition to protecting our skin some antioxidants have a proven capability to interfere with that melanin pathway and actually prevent or reverse signs of hyperpigmentation and the two main antioxidants that have proven to do this consistently are vitamin c and niacinamide when it comes to vitamin c and addressing hyperpigmentation one of my absolute favorite products is the skinceuticals floritin cf actually it's not just one of my favorites it's definitely like a cult favorite among my patients because it really is effective now i would never suggest using vitamin c alone to treat your hyperpigmentation but it should be included in a hyperpigmentation treatment regimen the floratin cf is a super lightweight serum almost watery like in the best way because it's very easy to layer with other products and then in addition to having the 10 l ascorbic acid or 10 vitamin c to fight hyperpigmentation it also has floratin which helps with hyperpigmentation as well as cell turnover and then fluoric acid which stabilizes the entire formulation so that it remains effective vitamin c is a staple in my skincare routine and i love the skinceuticals formulation so much and they will always hold a special place in my heart and i will repurchase them over and over and over again but i often get asked like hey can you recommend a vitamin c serum that isn't so spendy so i will i think a really affordable vitamin c is the timeless 20 vitamin c ferulic acid serum this has 20 percent l-ascorbic acid which is amazing if your skin can tolerate that level of ascorbic acid but not everyone's will be able to and it has ferulic acid so again this serum has a lot of potential it has powerhouse ingredients in it it always is going to come down to what works with you and your skin and your needs now let's talk about niacinamide this antioxidant is already included in so many different types of skincare products whether it's moisturizers or cleansers or sunscreens or other anti-aging products and so rather than having a specific step in your skin care just to introduce niacinamide i suggest finding a product that meets another need of yours that happens to also have niacinamide in it for example the elta md uv clear sunscreen which is one of my all-time favorite sunscreens also has niacinamide in it so when you're using that you're not only getting sun protection but you're also getting niacinamide into your routine so two birds one stone i also love the elastin restorative skin complex this is absolutely an investment but if you have more mature skin or you're trying to do the most for anti-aging with your skin this is a high-tech skin product that really has the technology as well as the clinical data to support it and it has niacinamide in it so you get this amazing anti-aging topical that also helps fight hyperpigmentation okay let's talk about another skincare product to fight hyperpigmentation and i was going to leave this to the end of the video but i had to move it up to now because you cannot go through this video a video on hyperpigmentation without thinking about sunscreen and sun protection if you take nothing else away from watching this i need you to remember and focus on the importance of sunscreen and sun protection when fighting hyperpigmentation do not even bother doing other hyperpigmentation interventions if you're not going to wear sunscreen and protect your skin from the sun because without that all of your hyperpigmentation is coming right back hyperpigmentation conditions tend to be exquisitely sensitive to uv light which is why the sunscreens i recommend for people who have hyperpigmentation are spf 50 or higher i also tend to recommend tinted sunscreens and the reason i recommend tinted sunscreens is because blue light which falls within the visible light spectrum can exacerbate hyperpigmentation and we know that tinted sunscreens can block blue light so you don't just want to have sunscreen to block uv light block that blue light too for the maximum potential improvement i have an entire youtube video dedicated to my favorite tinted spf so you should definitely check that out if you're looking for a recommendation recently i've been reaching for the skinceuticals sheer uv defense i think that's what it's called and i don't think i have it in that youtube video but i really like that it is a super liquidy lightweight sunscreen and i also love the tint on it it's not too orangey or warm so it tends to match my skin tone better especially if i don't have a fake tan okay i said my piece about sunscreen let's move on to other ingredients and products that help fight hyperpigmentation one thing i love about being a dermatologist and being in the skincare and cosmetic chemistry space is just how much innovation there is so i'm going to focus on some very specific pigment fighters here that have been in the game for a long time and have a long track record of proven efficacy but i'm so excited to see what continues to come down the pipeline and what continues to be developed that will also help us fight hyperpigmentation so maybe stay tuned for an updated video in a little while first up is hydroquinone now in the us this is only available via prescription and it is the gold standard pigment fighter hydroquinone comes in various concentrations usually it starts around two percent but you can have four percent six percent eight percent sixteen percent hydroquinone and oftentimes it is also formulated with other pigment fighting ingredients again because we talked about this hyperpigmentation is stubborn and the more effective ingredients you're using together generally the better there are a few caveats that come with using hydroquinone one you need a prescription so sometimes it's an access issue two higher percentages of hydroquinone generally are more effective but they can also be more irritating on the skin which can become problematic three hydroquinone is not recommended for use if you are trying to conceive are pregnant or are breastfeeding so there's a huge population of women who aren't able to use hydroquinone for some period of their life and four we generally don't recommend continuous use of hydroquinone typically dermatologists will recommend that you use hydroquinone for three to six months and then take a break from it and so you also are going to want to have access to other pigment fighting ingredients and products in between your hydroquinone usage or instead of using hydroquinone altogether my next skincare category for fighting hyperpigmentation is retinoids i don't even know how many videos on retinoids i've published at this point because they have so many benefits they are collagen stimulatory they are anti-aging in other ways they help with hyperpigmentation etc etc so they should kind of be in everyone's skincare routine in my personal opinion but i think retinoids have a huge place in fighting hyperpigmentation and they have consistently shown to reverse hyperpigmentation as a reminder there are multiple different ingredients that fall under the category of retinoids and all of these are vitamin a derived molecules things like retinols and retinaldehydes which you can get over the counter as well as prescription strength retinoids like tretinoin when it comes to treating hyperpigmentation with a retinoid they're by far and away is the most data for using a prescription strength topical retinoid specifically tretinoin however not everyone's skin can tolerate tretinoin and maybe it will be able to tolerate tretinoin one day but you have to start with a more gentle retinoid to start and that's where things like adaptolene and retinol and retinaldehyde come into play these are forms of retinoids that you can access kind of over the counter if you will and you can start by getting your skin used to that before moving on to prescription strength one of my favorite beginner retinoid products is by stradia and it's called night shift i've talked about this product several times before and it's just you know i like what i like and this product is just so creamy it has encapsulated retinol so it is a very gentle formulation that is still effective and i think it's a great way to get your skin used to a retinoid product if you want something with a little more oomph but maybe it's not like as sexy of a product i definitely recommend different or adapting 0.1 gel which you can get at most local drugstores this product is really marketed to and meant for people struggling with acne but we know that adaptiline also helps with hyperpigmentation so you can use it for whatever suits your particular skin needs all right next ingredient category alpha hydroxy acids and beta acids alpha hydroxy acids are things like glycolic acid lactic acid mandelic acid and beta-hydroxy acids are typically referring to salicylic acids and in my practice i will use glycolic acid chemical peels or mandelic acid chemical peels or salicylic acid chemical peels to help fight hyperpigmentation but you can get good strong alpha-hydroxy acid and beta-hydroxy acid formulations over the counter too that can also improve your pigment first up is the paula's choice skin perfecting 25 aha 2 bha exfoliating peel this is a powerful product so i would not recommend using this more than once a week and i feel like it has the most potential to benefit people with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation like if you had a lot of acne and now you have dark marks left behind this is the one to go to i know a lot of people are going to ask me to compare this to the ordinary which has a very similar product but i like this one better i just like the blend of ahas and i feel like it's more cosmetically elegant to use on the skin and then a couple other of my go-to aha exfoliating products that i love for hyperpigmentation and i've talked about these before are the sunday riley good jeans aha exfoliating products they have one with lactic acid that's so gentle and i just love it for people with sensitive skin who struggle with hyperpigmentation and just overall skin texture and then they have one with glycolic acid where i usually recommend going to the glycolic acid if you've used the lactic acid regularly you're looking for something with a little more oomph i do want to take a second to shout out body hyperpigmentation because i get so many questions about this not only post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from bug bites or scrapes on the legs or arms but also just excess pigmentation in the groin folds and in the armpits or on the elbows and knees and a lot of this is physiologic meaning that it's so normal to have darker armpits and groin and elbows and knees especially if you have a darker baseline skin tone but i also understand the want to lighten that up a little bit so the next couple products will be about that the glytone exfoliating body lotion which has glycolic acid in it is one of my all-time favorite body lotions i just think everyone should use glycolic acid in their body lotion not only does it help with hyperpigmentation but it can help with crepey skin and irregular skin texture and just smooths everything out and this is one of my absolute favorite glycolic acid lotions but remember keep in mind if you're using an alpha hydroxy acid on your body skin you also need to protect that skin from the sun because it is going to be more sun sensitive so just one other thing you don't want to be doing all this work with your body lotion and then exposing your skin to the sun and worsening your hyperpigmentation overall another ingredient that can really help with hyperpigmentation is kojic acid and i have a kojic acid body soap that i think is awesome i guess you can use it on your face too but i've only used it on my body because i feel like it's pretty powerful but it's great again for if you have those little hyperpigmentation marks on your legs or arms or you're working on lightening up your knees or elbows or groin or armpits etc it's the koji san facial beauty soap i can't remember who recommended it to me but it was a patient who had dealt with a lot of hyperpigmentation and she was like you know what dr ellis you know what finally helped me and she named this body soap so it is something that i recommend now to my patients who deal with hyperpigmentation and are looking for something to add into their arsenal to help with it you'll also probably notice that a lot of pigment fighting products that use a variety of pigment fighters tend to include kojic acid because it plays nice with others moving on i could not have a hyperpigmentation video without talking about azelaic acid acelic acid is just another one of those ingredients that has multiple things that it helps with it helps with acne it helps with inflammation it helps with rosacea it's safe in pregnancy and in breastfeeding so it's a wonderful ingredient to include in your overall skincare regimen for a variety of skin concerns but it has particular efficacy in fighting hyperpigmentation in the united states you can get azelaic acid as a prescription in 15 and 20 percent concentrations but you can also get azolic acid in lower concentrations without a prescription hands down in my opinion one of the best azoleic acid products is the glytone enhanced brightening complex this has a combination of azelaic acid and glycolic acid it is probably my most recommended product for people who are trying to conceive or who are pregnant or who are breastfeeding and are really worried about what's going to be in their skincare but really want something that is effective that's going to help with breakouts and pigmentation and skin texture and this serum just kind of like does it all it's wonderful the next ingredient up is tranexamic acid and in my practice i actually prescribe oral tranexamic acid for the treatment of melasma but it also is available in topical forms tranexamic acid used to be a more novel skincare ingredient and it seemed that every product that had tranexamic acid in it was crazy crazy expensive but i love that naturium has come up with a couple of different tranexamic acid products that don't break the bank i particularly like the naturium multibright tranexamic acid serum this does not just have training stomach acid but a couple other pigment fighters in there as well it's just a really beautiful texture it layers well with other products and i think it's a very affordable way to bring topical trans stomach acid into a hyperpigmentation routine full disclosure i am on the dermatology advisory board for notorium but i did not participate in the formulation of this product another pigment fighting ingredient that we often use in the dermatology office because it is prescription is sustaining cream also known as sespera this is a great pigment fighter but it doesn't work for everyone and the biggest turn off about this product is that it doesn't smell very good but it is effective for a lot of people in treating hyperpigmentation and for treating things like melasma there are certainly other hyperpigmentation fighters out there things like arbutin and licorice root extract and like i mentioned earlier on in this video there are products or ingredients that are newer in the market that still need more clinical data to support them but show a lot of promise so as those become more popular i'm going to do another hyper pigmentation video with all of that what are some skincare products that have helped with your hyperpigmentation tell me in the comments don't forget to like this video and subscribe to the channel and i'll see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video I'm going to share with you some products that I think will be really helpful for those of you out there suffering with a redness on the face whether it be due to rosacea or acne that heals with redness also those of you out there with darker skin types who are coping with hyperpigmentation listen up many of these products will help you as well because one of the challenges that people with darker skin may not appreciate is that redness can actually show up looking a little bit more like discoloration and if you've got some background hyperpigmentation going on it can actually be kind of challenging to distinguish redness from hyperpigmentation and you may actually have both things going on the first product that I'm going to recommend for you guys is a face wash at the end of the day is when I cleanse my skin and I only cleanse my skin once a day you can cleanse your skin twice a day but if you're dealing with redness try and keep it just to once a day the more times you put cleanser on your face and wash your face more likely it is to dry your skin and lead to worsening redness and I can really be a challenge to choose a cleanser if you cope with redness because all cleansers that are intended as it should be to remove dirt oil makeup all that goop off your skin they actually take some of your natural skin barrier with it and that makes you more predisposed to dryness and irritation a cleanser that is really good at minimizing this damage to the barrier but it does a good job taking off all the gunk is the sarony hydrating creamy cleanser this has Stara minds which are restoring for the skin barrier and it's free of added fragrance it's really a good choice so if you find that that one stings and burns a sagging cleanser that I would recommend for people with redness is the first aid beauty at face cleanser this product was sis with FA B antioxidant booster anyways this product has a licorice root extract as you many of the products I'm going to mention in today's video and licorice root is well known to be calming for redness and to inflammatory so you will see it in a lot of products marketed for people with redness so this has that in it and honestly I find that I don't know if it's all in my head with a licorice root but I do appreciate that this has kind of a calming soothing effect on the skin when I use it it also has fever if you extract in it as you many products aimed at people with redness feverfew has like a licorice root and shown to calm down redness and be anti-inflammatory however some people are easily irritated by that ingredient and were allergic to it the most allergenic part of feverfew is something called Perth dental line but in cosmetics that's actually been removed so it's pretty low risk but some people still are bothered by it if that's you then you might want to avoid this but otherwise it's really good and it's cruelty free it's pretty affordable so I love this one obviously it goes without saying I'm going to tell you you have to protect your skin from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun everyone has to do this but in the case of redness it's really important because ultraviolet radiation actually drives a lot of inflammation of the skin baser dilation and contributes to excess redness in the case of the melasma and these diseases of hyperpigmentation not only does the ultraviolet radiation Drive that inflammatory component that yields redness but it also pushes your skin towards making more pigment abnormally and creating hyperpigmentation so really important so I think a sunscreen that is tinted is a great option because the tent will help to camouflage some of the redness and in the case of hyperpigmentation the tent will also offer you some additional protection against pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light a sunscreen that's really great if you have fair skin and are looking for a tinted sunscreen is the exudes sheer daily protector this is a mineral sunscreen it only has as its active sunscreen ingredient zinc and titanium dioxide its mineral only and so for people with redness sunscreens that have chemical filters in them can cause more irritation and redness they don't get along well with them so I wanted to make sure I chose one that was mineral only this one is also great because it has green tea in it which is helpful for calming down redness it's anti-inflammatory gives a little bit of acne control and has been shown to diminish the appearance of pores it looks really good on the skin and it doesn't burn or sting around the eyes it doesn't ball or pull up or any of those nuisance e things but if you have a darker skin type you might find that the tint on this it's still pretty fair and kind of looks chalky Caste if you have a darker skin type a mineral only tinted sunscreen that works really well for darker skin types it's clear mineral tinted sunscreen or coats I will list suppose both of those down below for you all but if you have more of a medium skin tone the Sun fill redness relieving daily facial moisturizer SPF 20 is a good one to consider it has a licorice root in it which will help calm down that redness its mineral only so it's not gonna be irritating or staying the tint is more on the peachy kind of orange tan side so better for medium skin tones it's only SPF 20 so I recommend actually putting this on over a mineral only on tinted sunscreen that way you kind of camouflage you can use you need a higher SPF mineral sunscreen as your base layer and then kind of camouflage it with this so it helps mask that white cast and it also helps in providing some cosmetic camouflage against the redness and this looks really nice on the skin actually this I kind of considered this like a BB cream or a CC cream for those of you in the UK I did not forget about you I have sunscreen recommendations for both fair skin and darker skin type no these are chemical sunscreens so they might sting a little bit but the chemical filters in these are excellent for providing really really broad spectrum coverage of all wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation that can affect your skin and lead to redness and pigmentation I honestly don't have a lot of experience with mineral tinted sunscreens from the UK or anywhere in outside of the US I mostly I'm familiar with chemical one so that's why I picked these because I have the greatest familiarity with them altruist is a really sensitive skin friendly but the tint on the altruist is pretty dark so if you you know it's better for darker skin types in other words if you're fair with the rosacea for example you might not care for this in which case I definitely recommend the Bioderma a are SPF 50 plus tint on this is really nice the Alturas one goes on green and that helps in providing some camouflage against the redness and as you blend it onto the skin the other pigments kind of come out and take over and it turns to a darker brown now for people with redness especially related to rosacea it's best if you're gonna wear a makeup to choose makeup that is mineral tends to be very well tolerated for people with rosacea and a product that I enjoy and I think can be helpful is a mineral SPF powder now I reviewed several of these for you guys in the past and I have a few here that I'm gonna recommend but what you have to know about these mineral sunscreen powders is they really are like sprinkles on a cupcake it's a little bit of extra but it's not the whole frosting you need your base layer sunscreen when you put on a mineral powder it doesn't put on an even layer of SPF but it can be helpful for cosmetic camouflage of redness and also masking some of the shine of sunscreen and very well tolerated in people with sensitive skin the first one is the colorscience Unforgettable SPF 50 powder I've worked with this company numerous times but I love their products including this it is very expensive I will give it that but it's a very high SPF and it looks really nice on the skin just in terms of the pigment that they use it really looks nice and it stays on the skin very well it doesn't fall out a lot so I like this one personally but I know it's pretty expensive I know one that's pretty good is the supergroup invisible setting powder now this one doesn't have the spectrum of kind of tint range and depth of tint for cosmetic camouflage at the redness but it does do a really good job in reducing shine its SPF 45 so pretty comparable to the colorscience one a lot less expensive and then a cheapy one works pretty well is the derma derma e essential sun protection mineral powder SPF 30 a little bit lower but much less expensive zinc and titanium dioxide and it looks really good on the skin alright moving into the category of moisturizers moisturizing your face particularly namely a nighttime like after you cleanse the skin is really important for redness because when you cleanse the skin the skin barrier becomes impaired also just as part of redness a lot of that has to do with the dryness and irritation using a moisturizer can really address that barrier defect and help in rescuing your skin so to speak I adore the procurer rosa care product again with licorice root extract and this is a green tint so it will give you some cosmetic camouflage of the redness you may be wondering like why do I care about that at nighttime you actually can use this again in the morning if you wanted to underneath your sunscreen just make sure it dries fully before putting the sunscreen on it's very soothing in addition to the licorice root extract it also has niacinamide which will also help not only for calming down inflammation and irritation but can also have helped in issues related to hyperpigmentation this is really a good choice for those of you with a darker skin type that has a lot of hyperpigmentation plus redness that's a good choice mixture I love bioderma sensibio AR as well yeah the Bioderma moisturizers as liquorice we announced a soy extract I believe both of which can be anti-inflammatory and calm down redness but also helpful for hyperpigmentation Hannon has laminaria extract which is a marine extract and I've talked about those before they are competitive with hyaluronic acid for water binding capacity so this is a really a good one for our adding hydration into the skin as well as soothing redness alright and then indeed lasse has these color series of color correctors they have like one for yellow kind of sallow skin one for just hyperpigmentation but they've got a redness one this is the one I'm most familiar with nano blur and the color green it really helps as well I don't believe it has any active ingredients that address redness it's really more just that green tint that blends into the skin and camouflages out that redness this is really nice it kind of has like a blurring of back Domas as it alludes to in the title nano blur and this is a nice moisturiser for a night time or you could try using this under your sunscreen as well just again make sure it dries fully that way when you put the sunscreen on you kind of get take advantage of that green tint see if you use a product like this over your sunscreen it wipes the sunscreen off so the sunscreen has to be the last thing but if you put the sunscreen on moisturizer and while they're damp it can interfere with how the film is formed with a sunscreen so make sure it's fully dry that's what I'm getting at so key aspect of skin care keep it simple keep it minimal a few products is best especially when it comes to irritation redness discoloration more stuff you put on and more likely not it is to get worse any time people ask me in the comments how do i layer XYZ T&F together or product it's Z and Q can they be combined whatever you start wanting to combine all of these different products from multiple different manufacturers you're really going into an unknown there's no objective answer to a lot of these questions other than on you're probably just putting yourself at increased risk for irritation and potentially compromising the if efficacy of the actual active ingredients by keeping things really simple and just checking to the bare minimum you really maximize chances of good outcome from the actual active ingredient you're pursuing in the case of many of these products it might be licorice root and minimizing the risk of irritation and skin problems that would have been worse than your redness but yeah those are the products for redness that I can recommend you guys I know it's not fun to deal with redness people are not nice like people will ask why's your face rad it's like why are you so rude why are you a jerk I mean obviously you know your face is red so yeah I hope these products are helpful and this video is useful to you if you liked it give the thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

        "published_at": "2023-05-14T15:30:15Z",
        "transcript": "if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you're probably having a hard time coming with a skincare regimen or finding skincare products that are effective for you well today in this video we're going to discuss rosacea and I'm going to give you over-the-counter skincare that can help stay tuned till the end because I will make a skincare regimen for your rosacea skin type with actual product recommendations so my name is Dr Swati Canon and I'm a board certified dermatologist out here in California thank you so much for watching this video and welcome to my channel what is rosacea rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness flushing sometimes pimple like bumps on your cheeks your nose your chin as well as textural changes of the nose chin and forehead even various triggers can flare or worsen rosacea and some of these common triggers include alcohol spicy foods sun exposure even stress and I know stress can worsen really anything but stress definitely can worsen rosacea as well as certain histamine-rich foods like tomatoes avocados certain skincare products can also rest in rosacea so there are a lot of triggers for rosacea and a lot of people don't really know what their triggers are so I recommend sometimes keeping a diary so you can know like hey I had red wine and now I have redness and flushing and all the rosacea symptoms or I had an avocado toast yesterday and now my rosacea is worse so keeping a diary can help with noticing what your triggers are but you know it is annoying to keep a diary so I get it rosacea can also affect really any ethnicity and any gender but it is more common in middle-aged Caucasian men and women unfortunately rosacea is chronic like a lot of our inflammatory conditions and there is no cure there are different types of rosacea so we have categorized them into different subsets the first type is called erythamato telangiotatic rosacea I know I don't know why dermatologists have such long words but this type of rosacea is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels or dilated blood vessels on the skin the second type is called Popular are popular postular rosacea and this is when you get pimple like bumps kind of in the middle of your face often acne and popular puscular rosacea can go together so they can be seen together the third type is called fiberous rosacea and this is when you get a thickening of skin or like a bulbous appearance on your nose and finally there's also ocular rosacea this is rosacea affecting the eyes causing redness tearing itching and sometimes vision problems now these categories are actually kind of fluid and changing there is an overlap between all of these categories so you can have you know erythematode rosacea and popular puscular rosacea so there's a lot of overlap but it just kind of helps to Define and gives us guidelines for treatment this video is going to focus on redness and the pimple form of rosacea and how to calm down the Baseline inflammation in rosacea patients thymus and ocular rosacea there is not really any over-the-counter treatment that helps for that so those require prescription or in-office treatments what are the best in ingredients for rosacea the main thing for rosacea patients is to use anti-inflammatory and hydrating ingredients goal is to have a simple yet effective skin care regimen that decreases the inflammation and doesn't cause irritation so you don't want to overuse skin care products the first ingredient for rosacea that I really love is azolic acid we've talked about azelaic acid a lot on my channel and even in my previous video that gave you ingredients for discoloration as a lake acid is one of them so it is one of the best ingredients for acne for rosacea for skin lightening it is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial meaning that it decreases some of the bacteria that play a role in rosacea over the counter you can find 10 azelic acid and we also give prescription strength which is 15 or 20 percent acetylic acid it's best to use acelic acid at night time most rosacea patients are not going to be able to tolerate a retinoid so you're going to use azelic acid instead the next ingredient for rosacea patients is niacinamide and this is a form of vitamin B3 and again I have talked about it a lot nice and mind is in a lot of skincare products especially in moisturizers it's helpful for redness it is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for hydration it also regulates oil production it reduces the appearance of pores so it's really an overall great ingredient for rosacea patients who also have probably all these other issues I don't recommend using niacinamide above five percent I recommend staying under five percent so notorium has a five percent niacinamide gel that you can try also a lot of moisturizers sunscreens they do have niacinamide so you don't have to use niacinamide separately I actually recommend using niacinamide in a moisturizer or in a sunscreen versus by itself tranexamic acid is the other ingredient for rosacea I definitely have it in my previous video where I talk about how helpful it is for hyperpigmentation and melasma it is also so helpful for rosacea because we now know that txa regulates blood vessel formation excessive blood vessel formation and dilation of blood vessels is what causes the redness and the flushing in rosacea patients and so when we can regulate it we can really minimize the appearance of redness txa is also very gentle so it is very well tolerated by most rosacea patients the one that I like is the notorium tranexamic acid serum this contains five percent tranexamic acid and niacinamide plus kojic acid it's helpful for lightning and for rosacea the next ingredient for rosacea is sodium sulfacedamide plus sulfur so sodium sulfacetamide is an anti-inflammatory skincare ingredient but this is often a prescription and it's really hard to find it over the counter however you can find sulfur soaps over the counter and sulfur is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial and that's kind of how it helps rosacea it is incredibly stinky sulfur smells like rotten eggs so some people just can't tolerate the smell of it but sulfur also helps with acne it helps with dandruff called cyborg dermatitis there's a lot of uses for this ingredient so just to clear up any confusion the first ingredient I talked about was sodium sulfacetamide and this can come as a face wash but it's hard to find it over the counter it's usually a prescription we combine sodium sulfacinamide with sulfur and that combination is very good for rosacea but you can also just find sulfur alone as a soap and this is what's usually found over the counter and sulfur alone has some of these properties that I just talked about the next ingredient for rosacea is using ceramides so ceramides are emollients that I've spoken about in the moisturizer video before and ceramides repair the Skin Barrier and they help to hydrate the skin so for rosacea patients it's incredibly important to maintain your skin barrier to protect that Skin Barrier so that you don't get too much irritation I like products like Ulta MD or CeraVe that make moisturizers and sunscreen with ceramides and niacinamide glycerin is another really great humectant for rosacea patients because glycerin is such a powerful hydrating ingredient so it really draws in that water to help moisturize your skin the next ingredient for rosacea is called acetyl tetrapeptide 40. so remember in my peptide video and I don't know if you guys watched it if you haven't watched watch my peptide video please go check it out but in my peptide video I talked about certain peptides that are anti-inflammatory an acetyl Tetra peptide 40 is an anti-inflammatory peptide that can be very helpful for rosacea it helps to reduce inflammation as well as redness it also helps to maintain the Skin Barrier and to protect the Skin Barrier function there are also other peptides that can be anti-inflammatory in fact Paula's Choice peptide booster has multiple peptides several of which are anti-inflammatory and can be very helpful for redness and rosacea patients by the way if you're enjoying and learning from this video please hit the Thumbs Up Button And subscribe to my channel and please also share this video with others who would find it helpful I am trying to grow my channel in 2023 so I am very grateful to all of you who are watching commenting and interacting with my content another really great rosacea ingredient is called and I'm gonna butcher this Camila Camila sinensis anyway this is green tea leaf extract so green tea leaf extract is really helpful for rosacea green tea as we know is very anti-inflammatory it's a very powerful antioxidant and it is used in skincare sometimes especially for rosacea skin another ingredient that I'm going to butcher is called Santa Nella asiatica definitely can't pronounce that but we're going to continue so Santa Nella asiatica in India we actually have this ingredient as well but we call it go to kala and it has many many benefits I actually remember taking gotu kala when I was little for colds it is a powerful antioxidant it is anti-inflammatory and it also helps a lot for inflammation with rosacea patients so it has become a lot more popular in America and it's become a lot more popular in skincare recently in the last few years so beauty of joseon is a Korean skincare brand that actually has a serum that contains a green tea leaf extract Centinela asiatica and vitamin B5 so it's very calming it's hydrating and it's also fragrance free so for rosacea patients that's like a winner have you guys tried Korean skincare products and Korean sunscreens if so please let me know and comment below I really love how Koreans approach skincare with their hydrating and calming ingredients so I think I'm definitely gonna make a YouTube video about it soon but let me know what Korean skincare products you have tried so that I can also look into them Dr jart psychopair tiger grass serum tiger grass or pear serum this has Centinela asiatica and niacinamide it also has like a greenish tint so you can use it in the morning because the green tip helps to cover redness and then it's anti-inflammatory for the actual rosacea component Dr jart sick a pear stick a player is it sick of pear or a single player crap sometimes like I cannot remember these names but this particular line of product also has a moisturizer with similar ingredients that is very common for rosacea patients so you can either use it in a serum or as a moisturizer burrito Centinela green level safe SPF 50 p8 plus plus this isn't a really great sunscreen by the way for rosacea and acne important patients because it contains Centinela asiatica niacinamide vitamin E is an SPF 50. so I really do like this sunscreen fertilization patients and if you've tried it let me know the other sunscreens I normally like for rosacea patients I tend to like sunscreens with zinc oxide so which is a physical sunscreen and I like physical sunscreens over chemical sunscreens because sometimes chemical sunscreens can worsen or trigger rosacea but there are certain chemical sunscreen formulations that are okay that are more well tolerated and one of them is the Ulta MD UV clear and I recommend this for a lot of different patients but it's a really great sunscreen with SPF 46 it contains niacinamide and it's very well tolerated a La Roche Posay also makes various sunscreens for rosacea patients and these are also pretty well tolerated so not all chemical sunscreens are going to flare your rosacea in general I do prefer physical sunscreens but some chemical formulations are okay by the way let's clear up differences between sensitive skin rosacea and having allergies or rashes to certain skin care products so some sensitive skin that's a broad category of patients that just means that you can't tolerate skin care more readily this includes your rosacea patients but you can also have sensitive skin without having rosacea sensitive skin means you're more likely to get rashes or irritation or acne more easily so it's really a broad category that includes various skin types rosacea is what I just said earlier where you have dilated blood vessels and can be characterized by flushing or pimple like bumps this is different than people who get an allergic or contact dermatitis or a rash from exposure to certain ingredients and skin care products or to even certain metals or to other types of preservatives so the most common example of contact dermatitis is nickel dermatitis and dermatitis by the way just means inflammation of the skin so that's a very non-specific term but nickel dermatitis you might have seen this is when patients or when people get a rash around their belly button because of coming into contact with the nickel and the button and the pants or the jeans so if you you tend to get contact dermatitis a common way to test for this at home is you can apply skincare product on your forearm for one to six weeks and see if you get any rashes or irritation if not you can then try the product on your face now this by the way this test the forearm test doesn't work for rosacea patients so rosacea patients it's very hard to see for skincare products can help you or harm you until you try but for rosacea patients what you can do is just try on the side of your face and see if you if you get a flare what are my ingredients to avoid in rosacea skin salicylic acid is one ingredient to avoid even if you have acne and rosacea so I know we commonly use salicylic acid for acne it is anti-inflammatory but it is also so irritating that we don't really recommend it for rosacea patients and this is a similar concept for benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide also is anti-inflammatory we also use it for acne but I don't always recommend it for rosacea patients because they can be irritating perhaps in low percentages it would be okay we just have other ingredients that we can use so we don't have to use these and this is the same for glycolic acid which is a type of chemical exfoliating acid because it's irritating or it can be irritating I also don't recommend it for rosacea now on the flip side polyhydroxy acids which are like a newer type of exfoliating acid they can be helpful for rosacea because they are less irritating they are more gentle and they can be anti-inflammatory so some rosacea patients can try polyhydroxy acids by the way not everyone needs to exfoliate so your skin naturally exfoliates on its own you don't have to use a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid or polyhydroxy acid to help exfoliate so don't feel the need to do so other ingredients like witch hazel Menthol camphor those all cause tingling that doesn't mean by the way it's working but they're all kind of these tingling irritating ingredients and I don't recommend them for rosacea other astringents or toners that contain alcohol or heavy content of alcohol definitely avoid this if you have rosacea because it can be so drying on the other hand though rose water toner can be helpful because rose water is coming and I actually made this video it talks about at home remedies for skin hair and nails if you're interested you can definitely go check it out fragrance if you see that on the label that could potentially also be irritating for rosacea so I would be mindful about it but by the way when you're looking at fragrance and alcohol you know you have to also see where it is on the ingredient list so if alcohol is like the sixth or seventh ingredient in the ingredient list it's probably gonna be okay and it's not going to dehydrate your skin that much but if it's in the top three ingredients then that means that that skin care product has too much alcohol and could potentially dehydrate your skin so retinoids I mean they are really an anti-aging Powerhouse but they can definitely trigger and flare rosacea so you do have to be careful I don't think retinoids are completely off limits for rosacea patients it really depends on how severe your rosacea is and what your triggers for rosacea are you know you just want to be careful so if you're going to want to use retinoids and you have rosacea you want to start very gentle gentle retinoids and then slowly increase their use as tolerated so to learn how to incorporate retinoids you can actually watch one of my first YouTube videos ever on retinoids and it really kind of teaches you how to incorporate a retinoid slowly into your skincare regimen some good options for retinoids in rosacea patients include this Keels Retinol Serum it's ceramides and peptides so this one contains retinol which is a gentler former for retinoid also and it contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides and peptides so start this one slowly but it is a good option for rosacea patients of course if you see an irritation or you see flaring of your rosacea stop any of these skincare products immediately the other good one for rosacea patients is the ordinary Grand active retinol Emulsion brand active retinol is a much gentler type of retinoid so it's really great for rosacea and sensitive skin types and this one also contains squalene invisible law which are ingredients that help with inflammation and hydration and it doesn't contain the shark squalene but the vegan version of squalene now how would you combine all of these ingredients for a skincare regimen in the morning you can use a gentle cleanser so you can actually use the sulfur wash or a prescription sodium sulfacetamide wash like I talked about earlier or you can just use a gentle cleanser like the La Roche Posay tolerain hydrating gentle cleanser or CeraVe gentle cleanser after you clean your face you can use one of the green tea serums like the beauty of joseon green tea serum or the Dr jarts like a pear serum followed by a moisturizer and then sunscreen on top so your moisturizer recommendations include like the Dr jarts like a pear moisturizer or a banana cream moisturizer or a CeraVe moisturizer really anything that's gentle and contains ceramides is a good moisturizer for rosacea patients and you would then follow this up by a sunscreen like the Alta MD UV clear sunscreen which also contains ceramides and niacinamide at night time you can again clean your your face and make sure you use a gentle cleanser to wash off even the makeup of your face you can then use a gentle retinoid like the Kiehl's Retinol Serum or you can use acelaic acid at night time so if you're going to use salicylic acid you can actually use it every single night as long as you don't get irritation but if you want to start a retinoid then you can use a retinoid twice a week and use azelic acid on the other night you would then follow this up with a moisturizer as well and some good moisturizer for rosacea patients include Ulta mdpm therapy or that Dr jart sickle player moisturizer that I talked about earlier on a side note if you do wear makeup and heavily tinted sunscreens and you have rosacea I still recommend that you double cleanse so you can watch this video on double cleansing to learn how to do it well for rosacea patients I don't want you to use any cleansers that strip the moisture off your face so to remove the makeup I recommend the cleansing bombs like the pharmacy Green Clean cleansing balm which is very hydrating and then you would follow the cleansing balm with a gentle cleanser an alternate skin care regimen would be this so in the morning you would cleanse like I talked about above you can then use a vitamin C serum and we'll talk about that soon followed by a moisturizer and then Alta you know the Alta MD sunscreen at night time again you can double cleanse use your azelaic acid and then a niacinamide moisturizer so as you notice I did mention vitamin C even if you have rosacea and vitamin C can really help with rosacea because it is anti-inflammatory and so it can help with some of the flares that rosacea patients have however certain forms of vitamin C and high concentrations of vitamin C can also flare rosacea so if you want to learn how to use vitamin C and you have rosacea make sure to check out this video that I have on vitamin C where I give vitamin C recommendations for rosacea patients and you can learn how to use it in your skincare regimen so thank you so much for

        "transcript": "hi guys this is not only the latest that I've ever filmed a video um I've also never really been this unpresented before a video where I'm going to be talking about my skin my Skin's not looking great but trust me it's actually quite good at the moment it used to be a lot worse um but yes in this video I'm going to be talking about my updated skincare like what's been working for me and I'm also gonna have a quick chat about the whole laser situation because I've been getting a lot of comments on my old videos where I was talking about my laser and I just thought I would thought I would address some of those questions in this video so we'll get started with what I'm currently using um because I haven't posted like a skin care um like what I'm using for over well over a year now I must be um and the videos I used to post were what I was what products I was using for my rosacea and for my perier or dermatitis which I suffered with um and yeah some of them have changed some of them no longer work for me and I found some new ones that now do work for me so let's get into it my silicone is in water I use every day to take off my makeup um whether I am wearing makeup or not wearing it I will use it to take either just my makeup off or just cleanse my face after micellar water I use the CeraVe sa smoothing cleanser I have been using this for about maybe five months four or five months um and I am using this in replacement of my Paula's Choice um aha solution um I used to use that a lot I had some great results with it I did a whole video on it and I really would recommend people trying it if you're trying to find a way use a product that has salic acid in it to break down like clogged pores but unfortunately you know your your skin changes over time and mine just didn't like it anymore it was just a bit too I kind of saw it stop working like I feel like I started to get black blackheads and stuff and before I didn't so anyway I scrapped that and I introduced a cleanser with salic acid in it so I still have salic acid in my routine this this next step is a bit weird I then put this on my face which is nice oral two percent anti-tandruff shampoo what I do with this is I like Pat my face dry after cleansing it and then I will put this on my forehead and like my chin line and leave it for five minutes and then wash it off um this is for treatment of fungal acne um if you have ever had fungal acne you can get it for a bunch of different reasons you can get it from or like excessive oil excessive sweating I think you can get it from um you can get it from like uh I think it's like clogged hair follicles or something you can also get it from having um antibiotics very regularly as they mess up your whole bacteria levels basically I take a lot of antibiotics um for another issue in itself and so then once I wash that off obviously I put my face dry and then I go on my skincare on the dry side of things first off I don't have it with me but I'm still using the metronidazole gel um I honestly think the one I'm using is our update now because I stopped using it for ages and then I've started using it again because I noticed that I was getting like quite inflamed spots and that is a treatment the metronidazole or whatever is a treatment for rosacea and I found that it um it helps with the information side of things and it does help my skin I think it helps so I'm just using it um after that I use the Vichy 90 89 sorry booster which is a hyaluronic which is a hydrating hyaluronic acid serum um I've only been using this for about two months now but I've been absolutely loving it it's basically just super super hydrating um hyaluronic acid is really good for your skin um and yeah I haven't had any bad reactions to it I think it's helping my skin feel a lot smoother and a lot plumper so I am really enjoying it and the bottle is beautiful beautiful it's glass it's a blue and white ombre I'm obsessed uh so after that comes the big game changer um as you may know if you've watched any of my past videos and my video on perier oral dermatitis the reason that I developed dermatitis and it was really really bad I'll see if I have any photos and put them here it was all over my eyelids all over like my um my nose and my my lips like around the sides it was during lockdown thankfully but it was bad and it was because I was putting too many um strong products on my face and to top it off I started using the ordinary retinol a serum um and that was just like boom my face was like nope at that point I think I was using azaleic acid salic acid retinol a niama side and zinc like I was just using a lot and now I've sort of like cut back like on the other side of things I'm only using salic acid in my cleanser hyaluronic acid is pretty gentle so I'm fine with that and then this is what I'm using for my retinol which I've only started using Nat recently it's the CeraVe retinol resurfacing serum what I like about this product is that it has a small like a very very small amount of retinol a in it so small in fact that it is so far down the ingredients list um it's like nothing to be concerned about the other ones the other like ones I've tried are really really strong really potent and my skin just obviously couldn't handle it so I started off using this about four to six weeks ago I'd say um no actually way longer than that because it's almost empty maybe two months plus actually um and I used it every other day and now I use it every day and I love it it has helped my skin so much on the acne side of things I put it across my four oh I mean I put it everywhere but I have actually started to develop a tiny tiny little rash however I'm on top of it like because I know what happened last time and I know the things that helped my perioral dermatitis last time um so I'm treating I'm treating it and I think I'm on top of it and I'm just avoiding putting the retinol in those sensitive areas so I'm doing again my forehead my jawline and then like just like the sides of my cheeks and not I might like my nose but basically like not like the Triangular area under my eyes and not like around my nose the retinol is great obviously because it helps your um so it increases your cellular turnover it's quite good for rosacea as well but most importantly um I would say the effects that I've seen are on the acne side of things it's very drying which is probably why it helps my skin because I have very oily skin so after I use this I then go in with a moisturizer which is just that no no children you know neutral Junior nitrogena oh my God why can't I say it the Hydro Boost gel um this is I think I'm almost out to be fair I just use a tiny little bit and I just put it all over my face um you can use anything I like this one because I think it's oil free so it's really good for oily skin obviously I got a question the other day um on my perioral dermatitis and said what do you suggest using around the eye area and since using my retinol I have been getting really really dry under under my eyes even though I am actively avoiding putting it in that area I don't know why it's just happening unless it may be the hyaluronic acid but how I counteract that is by using this which I've spoken about before the evinae um restorative protective cream I'm sure if you've watched any videos on um eczema or perioral dermatitis you'll know what this is so after I've done all of that I then put like a tiny bit on my fingers and I just go like underneath and then I also put it here which is where that little like rashy bit is coming up and that's been keeping that like great like very much under control and it's massively reducing it and then once a week I will then use my larochet um D plug-in mask or whatever because I find that even though all of that is great for my skin or is helping my skin anyway um it sounds like loads of stuff that I'm using but it doesn't really seem that much um but anyway sorry I'm still finding that I have like clogged pores and blackheads because I'm not using an exfoliator now technically I know that the retina is a little bit exfoliating but still um and I love this I've been using it for about five weeks six weeks once a week for that length of time and I find that it just pulls out all the gunk basically and helps completely decock my pores so that is me for the skin care that I've been using for someone who has suffered with perior dermatitis eczema um rosacea sensitive skin all of it all of the above and this is currently working for me are plus one other thing all right which isn't even anything to do with this video I did a completely separate video on it itself but it's honestly I'm loving it so much I feel like I have to mention it and I got gifted this but I absolutely love it it's the current body mask it's the LED face mask it has reduced my redness for my rosacea so much the next morning after I use it I can tell when I've used it like my skin is like non-red and it's plump and it looks hydrated and I love it I absolutely love it um I'm really really grateful that I got the opportunity to work with that brand um because yeah I'm a big advocate for it now so you know if that was marketing done right because I am a big fan now um so laser wise um I have had like three sessions I think in the last six months of the laser that goes all over your face I have one more session page for and I I'm like Ugh annoyed really because I don't think it's making a difference I've done two videos I've done videos doing the whole facial flushing and whether that's worked and then I've also done a video on the spider vein which is specific laser on like your capillaries and broken capillaries um so this facial flushing laser I don't know if that's stopped working for me if I'm not getting it done enough for to for it to make a difference but I've sort of stopped that now I will use my last one um obviously because I paid for it but after that I probably won't do it again um but in a recent video that I posted I got a question about my laser um for my my broken capillary on my face I don't know if I have any photos if I do I'll post it here because it was really bad um and I got yeah laser therapy for it I had the laser therapy for a for probably a total of like nine months and then it was like basically complete no it was completely gone during those nine months they did it didn't just go after one session like it would get lasered and then it would look better but still be there and still be like red and then it would I'd go again and it would be a little bit less red and I almost feel like I plateaued a bit at the like the six month Mark um so I actually switched laser clinics and then in the last three months it was like boom they got rid of it completely um so that I 100 recommend because that was like a lifesaver for me because my broken capillary on my nose was so bad it literally looked like an open wound it was awful so if you are getting the treatment and you've started to see like some changes but you're worried that it's not gone completely don't worry it's a process like it takes a few months um it's not going to go in one session so yeah I'm seeing the time and it's 17 minutes I've been talking for 17 minutes that is it I'm really sorry I've been rambling I feel like this video hasn't been helpful at all I've just been talking at you but I wanted to give you an update of what I'm using what's currently working for me um and just like an update on the laser thing because I've been having a lot of traction on that so thank you for watching I hope it's been helpful let me know if you have any questions down below um if you have like rosacea let me know any other products that you'd recommend I'm pretty good with my routine at the moment and I'm scared to introducing the thing else but I love doing research and research in the background so please share thanks for watching and I'll see you next week's video bye",

        "transcript": "good morning my little nerds i am dr shireen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city welcome to my youtube channel please feel free to like subscribe and comment below i definitely try to read through all the comments on saturday and sunday once the video is published and hopefully i will get to your comment question request in the next video so today i decided to tackle this a little bit differently and focus on sensitive skin maybe because i'm feeling a little sensitive these days going through construction on an office sucks and there's no better way to put it and i find myself tearing up or crying at a drop of a pin so i thought i would empathize with all my sensitive soul skin people out there and do a video just for you so in this video we're going to cover the basics as to what is sensitive skin what to look out for and a couple of my favorite products on the market in each category that would be best geared and suited for you so sensitive skin the way i look at patients who come in with sensitive skin is the way i felt when i was pregnant walking into a very fancy restaurant or a sushi restaurant where everything was there at my disposal but i was not allowed to eat it and i feel for people with sensitive skin because they probably walk into a walmart ulta sephora target and basically see all the skin care and feel very limited and trapped because they're too scared to approach any of them so i see you and i feel for you because it sucks people with sensitive skin tend to experience redness inflammation dryness stinging burning itching and even acne breakouts pretty much everything and the reason why they tend to react so much more profoundly is because their skin barrier is not as strong and as intact as somebody with quote unquote normal skin or even oily skin and so they need to approach any new product that they put on their face very gingerly very cautiously and really allow themselves the time to see if that product works for them and really gets to see how their skin responds and that's why i always say get to know your skin before you decide to jump in and incorporate 20 new skin care products in your skincare routine overnight because your skin will freak the f out it will go all right it just will not work i also want to say that oftentimes i find it amusing when i'm reading skin care product reviews online whether it's sephora or alta or target or whatever and i he and i read this product made my skin get really really red and inflamed it sucked i'm sorry to break it to you but maybe the product didn't suck it just sucked for you it's one of those it's not me it's you or it's not you it's me situations the product itself is what it is but if you're somebody who's very sensitive maybe it sucked for you that's just something to keep in mind especially as you are becoming a more well-versed skincare consumer and you're reading these reviews online about products at least this way you're becoming more aware as to what you know you take it with a grain of salt and you kind of see if it applies so what exactly is the difference between sensitive skin versus sensitized skin sensitive skin is as we just described somebody who has you know these sort of propensities to reacting or becoming inflamed or red or breaking out or whatever it is to various different ingredients that are not specific sensitized skin means you're now reactive to a very specific ingredient because your skin is sensitized to that ingredient so you've developed an allergy specifically against this ingredient not everybody with sensitive skin becomes sensitized the likelihood yes is higher but it doesn't mean that you're going to become all of a sudden sensitized to all fragrances and that's why i always laugh at how everybody exes out fragrances obviously if you have sensitive skin probably avoid but somebody like myself has normal skin doesn't need to avoid fragrance but that is the difference between sensitive and sensitized and once you're sensitized in a very twisted way it's almost kind of like a blessing very twisted way because now you know that you need to avoid that one ingredient and you know just never to use it so you can then look out for products that doesn't contain it and how to discover if you actually have sensitized skin it's by going to an allergist or a dermatologist and getting patch tested not prick tested patch tested where they put patches to see if your skin has developed an allergic reaction to an allergen what are the common and i'm going to say one two three let's keep going four ish five ish things to look for or to try to avoid if you have baseline sensitive skin and i'm going to lead this with what i just talked about fragrance i think it's important to try to minimize your risk of becoming sensitized to different ingredients fragrances can cause a lot of reactions and if you're somebody who's super super sensitive you probably want to look for something without fragrance the caveat is fragrance can be masked as anything it's not like you look at the ingredient list and it's written fragrance you know like even lolita there's no ingredient list printed on this it's not brilliant fragrance it could be masked as essential oils which obviously contain fragrances there's an ingredient called balsam of peru which is a very very famous fragrance that is put in a lot of skincare products there is also perfume or i don't know how you perfume parfait whatever that is basically another word for fragrance because it's usually a proprietary concoction of different scents so you're not necessarily going to find fragrance in the ingredient list so you have to know what you're looking out for number two alcohol alcohol is a really bad rep and it doesn't deserve it there's different types of alcohols there's denatured alcohols okay and those are basically alcohol denate or what's it called sd but those are not fatty alcohols the reason i say avoid those types of denatured alcohols is because you're trying to put chances on your side it's kind of like with fragrances alcohols are used in formulations to enhance penetrations of other actives it can be a little bit stripping and drying and so if you have a compromised skincare skin barrier you're obviously going to approach a little bit with caution but again i don't want you guys to freak out it's not all alcohols are created equal and one day we're going to do a deep dive into alcohol in another video but that's just something to kind of keep in mind if you're on the extreme end of sensitive skin third foaming washes things with sodium lauryl sulfate and i it's a i'm getting a lisp sls but those are things you also want to avoid because those can be over stripping like i said causing a compromised skin barrier making your sensitivities worse and finally tingling agents any kind of cream that you see that says cooling sensation probably has menthol peppermint in it and those can be very very very um reactive to your skin you can kind of do a small test by looking at your toothpaste if you're somebody has super sensitive skin when you brush your teeth with any kind of mint toothpaste you can see if you know you're developing sort of reactions around your mouth that can be kind of a like a very easy poor man's test to see if you're reactive to it and last if you are a super nerd and if you have the time to look into the ph of certain formulations you want to avoid cleansers with very very high ph because that can be over stripping and again compromise your skin barrier so how do we know then which products you want to incorporate in our routine i think it's pretty simple approach with caution test a small area in front of your ear out or even right here underneath your ear do that every day for a week to see how your skin responds because it's not necessarily going to respond with the first go-around and then see how you like the product and if it works and you're okay use it all over your face but do that for at least one to two weeks before incorporating something new it's tedious it's time consuming it's emotionally draining i am not disagreeing with you but your skin will thank you in the long run all right now claims what are the claims we want to look for when we are trying to find products with sensitive skin you want to see things that are formulated for sensitive skin like this product right here i can never do this by vanity cream all right so number two you want to look for fragrance free claims not unscented unscented like certain soap bars actually has a chemical in there that masks the scent so you don't look for unscented it is not the same as fragrance free there are two separate claims they are not the same so you want to look for fragrance free a third little tidbit if you see this label by the eczema association it's probably something that's better suited for you as well four you want to look for things that are hypoallergenic sort of like your comforter for your bed think of it as comforter for your face hypoallergenic is always going to be better and five anti-redness products cannot claim to calm inflammation otherwise it'd be considered like drugs and it has to have a drug claim on them so a lot of skin care products over the counter use words like soothing calming redness reducing anti-redness as code word for sensitive skin so that's just something for you guys to think of and to look out for and so you just need to make sure that you are really reading between those lines let's jump in quickly to some of my favorite roundups of products starting with cleansers i love this guy i never ever ever not bring vana cream up i think it is a great cleanser for sensitive skin it is free of pretty much everything masking fragrance like we talked about for unscented lanolin which is a wool alcohol found in aquaphor not vaseline um i don't care about the parabens but parabens fine other preservatives dyes formaldehyde etc it is really really gentle almost too gentle if you're somebody who wears heavy makeup you're definitely going to need to load up on another step for a double cleanse because it's not going to be enough which leads me to this the bioderma micellar water this is the sense bio h2o i like this one a lot because it is formulated for sensitive skin it does not contain fragrance whereas a lot of other french products do and i think that it is extremely extremely um it's hypoallergenic and it is extremely gentle so the combination of this and this does the job if you're wearing as much makeup as like i am currently which is a very light under eye concealer um i put a little bit of powder on my eyes eyebrow pen eyeliner and mascara so this these two are actually great for a light makeup day all right and then third everybody talks about you know cerave's hydrating cleanser it's nice because it's ceramide infused and you definitely want to use ceramides to help to restore your skin barrier moving on to serums i love a good hydrating serum but most of them on the market contain hyaluronic acid if you have sensitive skin i would strongly urge that you watch my ha video and try to cut it out code words for hyaluronic acid in the ingredient list are sodium hyaluronate and a nice alternative is this one by aveeno i've been speaking about this one a lot it is the calm and restore triple o serum it is extremely calming and soothing especially if you have eczema and it is really nicely geared towards sensitive skin so if you're looking for a hydrating serum i would strongly urge that you guys look into this one the one downfall is this dropper socks it is probably one of the worst droppers i've ever used on the market you guys can flip it out for a pump head um i've posted a video on it on tiktok one day i'll do a video here for you guys a second serum i really like is dr jart's sick appear serum the reason i like this one and i haven't opened this particular bottle i just bought this is because it has sentella asiatica and sentella is a great ingredient as i'm struggling to open this where are my scissors i don't have scissors so sentella is a great ingredient to help reduce redness it cannot say that it treats redness or it's anti-inflammatory but know that it is it isn't the same similar style dropper as the aveeno but i will say the quality of this dropper is you know you cannot compare it to the dropper of the aveeno one it is light green in color which helps to counteract the redness that usually is appearance with sensitive skin or rosacea but i love this serum i think it is beautiful it definitely helps to repair and soothe dry skin especially sensitive skin and it is one that i recommend quite often to my own patients so that is sick a pair moving on to exfoliants i think exfoliants have gone a little bit wild i love a good chemical exfoliant but a lot of patients and people in general are now overdoing it and really compromising their skin barrier so you want to go with something where less is more lactic acid is a very gentle chemical acid stones by sunday riley it is not going to be one of those massive powerhouses but it's very gentle and it's going to help you lightly buff your skin so this one's a nice one and then usually i would say be careful with salicylic acid as it can be drying but i found this one by first aid beauty which is two percent salicylic acid safe for sensitive skin which they claim on here i personally have not used it but it is something out there if you are acne prone to sensitive skin you might want to look into these um first aid beauty two percent salicylic acid um treatment pads they're just something to kind of think about all right and finally moisturizers you want to think of your skin as a broken baby's butt okay and you just want to cocoon your skin you want to cocoon it you want to restore your skin barrier you want to treat it like it is a sculpture on the verge of breaking and so moisturizers are going to be the best thing for you and so i have a bunch so starting with again dr jart has this ceramide cream this one is infused with ceramides it's great for super dry skin it's also great for sensitive skin like we talked about it comes in a nice um tube metallized tube and it is a good and really thick cream again not for somebody with super oily skin somebody with really dry slash sensitive skin this might just be enough for you again if you're super sensitive though i would be careful because it's not necessarily the quote unquote purest of products out there as it has other ingredients as well including a scent okay for example it has citrus in it so just beware but it is going to help if you're super dry and you need your barrier repaired if you're worried about any sort of scent your best bet is plain old vaseline this is probably the cheapest and the fastest way you're going to fix your face or your skin if you have super sensitive skin where your barrier is compromised it's literally just petroleum jelly in it and there's no lanolin whereas for example aquaphor contains lanolin so this is something i think you guys should look into and not be scared to test out on your face if your skin is extremely sensitive broken dry trapped irritated flaky stingy etc you might want to do this for a week see how your face responds to it and then decide if you hate it or if it actually saved your face just saying so number three is the sequel fat cream you guys can find this at your local drugstore it's by aven and then i've spoken about this i love the sycoplast balm b5 by la roche posay it's a very thick and chewy cream it is really really like it just cocoons everything it is not for somebody who you're gonna have to really get it in there it does have a little bit of zinc in it which causes that white cast but that can also be inflammatory reducing so just something to kind of think about if your skin is extremely sensitive and just not in a good spot and if you want to treat yourself a really nice one for winter coming up is skinceuticals triple lipid this one is loaded in ceramides and it's going to help to restore your skin's barrier and finally a sunscreen a very easy sunscreen that you guys can use a sensitive skin that's not going to kill your face in the process it's going to not only help protect and soothe it cetaphil they have this daily facial moisturizer with spf 20 which is honestly too light but it's something to start with if you are somebody who cannot approach any sort of sunscreen in the u.s at least without getting some sort of reaction it is with titanium dioxide and zinc dioxide so it is a um mineral based sunscreen it does come with a tint all right not necessarily the best of tints for everyone myself included but again if you're somebody who's super sensitive and you just want to try to get some sort of protection in and you don't walk a lot outside during the day or don't work by a window you can at least try to start incorporating this sort of sunscreen in your daily routine so those are some of my favorite products in a nutshell i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you sensitive souls out there can now sort of walk through a beauty aisle with a little bit more confidence and i hope this video was helpful i will catch you guys next week have a great weekend [Music] you",

        "transcript": "[Music] hello my name is dr sam ellis and i am a board certified dermatologist welcome to my bathroom in addition to practicing both medical and cosmetic dermatology in northern california i am also an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at uc davis and i'm a consultant for skin care companies and i help them develop products that are evidence-based tonight i am going to be taking you through my anti-aging skincare routine [Music] now a lot of people kind of bristle at the anti-aging term and what i mean is not that i don't want you to be getting older as a physician i i want to get older i want my patients to be getting older because the alternative is not great but you might not want your skin to look weathered or tired i want my skin to be plump and youthful and healthy and that is what this skincare routine is all about but in sort of a low maintenance streamlined way all right we've got the towel on the hair is back we are ready to rock and roll with a nighttime skincare routine a little bit of background about my skin is that it's not particularly oily it is not particularly dry it is somewhat sensitive because i have a skin condition called rosacea which makes me prone to redness and flushing especially with a glass of wine but i don't get the pimples that some people with rosacea do get which is really lucky for me but i do have to be mindful that some products do irritate my skin and that i'm a little bit more sun sensitive i also spent my whole life outside i'm from california i was a swimmer and i played water polo through college so i have a lot of sun damage that i have been working on for the past several years but that is also something that i'm trying to tackle in my nighttime skincare routine so the first step of any skincare routine in the evening is going to be cleansing your skin the whole point of this is to remove all of the junk and debris that have built up on your skin over the day maybe take off makeup or sunscreen not or sunscreen definitely sunscreen if you don't have sunscreen on your face we're gonna have a problem but you need something to take that all off because if that's just sitting on your skin while you sleep that's gonna clog your pores make you more prone to breakouts it's going to make your skin look dull so you need to cleanse that off and the other part of cleansing that's important is that it sets your skin up to absorb and interact with the next set of products that you're going to put on it i am a huge fan of the double cleanse and i feel like if you're watching this you probably know what a double cleanse is but for those who don't the double cleanse is basically a two-step cleansing process where you use a more oil-based cleanser to remove that top layer of debris that's on your skin and break up some of the product and then you use a second cleanser usually a water-based cleanser to wash that all away so today i am going to be using the clinique take the day off cleansing balm as my first cleansing step it's not waxy it's almost creamy but holds its shape and then as you put it into your hands you can see the warmth from the body just melts it all away but all that product is still sitting here and i'm going to massage it into my face and the whole point is to really just break up that product and you can start to see my tinted moisturizer coming off you can see that redness of my skin underneath but i like to see the redness because then i know that my makeup is getting removed so i usually will take this up onto my forehead in the eyebrows i usually grab a little bit more for my eyes i feel like breaking up the eye makeup is so important you don't want today's mascara to become tomorrow's eyeliner because if you've ever fallen asleep with your makeup on you know what i'm talking about and if you haven't then that probably made zero sense to you so i'm just massaging really gently and delicately around this i'm going over my eyelashes and really trying to press the product down and away in a second i'll peek and see what kind of scary mess i've created oh yeah that's good that's really good and so at this point everything's broken up i'm gonna get it wet i'll just get my fingers damp and then we do something called an emulsifying process where i add a little bit of water to the product and you can see it turns kind of white and creamy and that really helps with the cleansing that water grabs onto the product and the product grabs onto the dirt and oil and makeup and sunscreen and lotion that's on your face and now i'm going to dip down and cleanse see in a second got all of that cleansed off and now i'm ready for my second step of the double cleanse but you can see like i don't really have eye makeup on anymore you can start to see the texture and the color of my skin meaning that i feel confident that my makeup has been removed with that step for my second step i'm going to use the vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin i hope there's some still in here i use this a lot yeah we're good so this cleanser is sort of like a pearlescent gel i really like it i feel like i need a lather in my facial cleanser at least one of the steps i might have been brainwashed by the cosmetic industry i don't care to me this makes it feel like something is really happening i like this cleanser because it's sort of a no-nonsense it's not an exfoliating cleanser it's really just the purpose is to get your face clean so i just kind of massage it go down my neck normally i would do this stuff in the shower so usually i would do my cleansing balm emulsify it and then hop in the shower wash my face and body in the shower and then come back out and do the rest of my routine but if i take this into the shower this video is going to take on a whole nother life so this is all massaged in go over my eyelashes one more time make sure everything's really good drop back down it's going to rinse it off all right so the face has been cleansed and when i'm done cleansing my face i don't want it to feel dry or tight but i also don't want it to feel oily or particularly hydrated yet i just need it to feel ready to accept whatever i'm going to put on it next i feel like if your skin is feeling too dry or tight after you cleanse you might need to switch your cleanser either to one that has a lower ph so something in the five to six range sometimes a more basic cleanser that sits more at the seven to eight range and the ph can be more stripping for the skin and although some skin can handle that a lot of people can't and so that's one thing to look for in your cleanser if you're noticing you're feeling really dry the other thing is that you can look for ingredients like glycerin or shea butter in your cleanser because those are hydrating ingredients that can support your skin while you wash once i've cleansed i'm in the home stretch that is honestly the thing that takes the longest in my entire routine the next thing i'm going to do is put on my trusted tretinoin so this is a retinoid this is a prescription strength retinoid and you can see this tube is very well loved so well loved that i am worried about getting some out of the tube right now a little more all right we're good pea sized amount that's all you need it takes me a while to get through one of those tubes because that's all you need for your entire face so when i'm putting a retinoid on i do the dot method i think this is not new for any body but that helps me sort of distribute it but a little goes a really long way with this product i just put any extra that's on my fingertips kind of down my neck the neck skin is so much more sensitive than facial skin because it does not have the same density of hair and oil glands that the face has so it doesn't have the same repair abilities and so you have to be really careful with the neck because you go in with 0.05 tretinoin and you might be sorry the other thing i will sometimes use on my neck is like a retinol so a retinol is a not prescription strength retinoid it is something that's weaker than tretinoin because it has to be converted in the skin into retinoic acid it has to be converted into tretinoin and therefore in that conversion it gets weakened quite a bit and so sometimes i'll go in with that on my neck or even around my eyes i don't want to spend too much time talking about retinoids even though they are amazing because you could probably find a million excellent videos here that go into more detail but essentially retinoids are vitamin a derived compounds that are the best thing you can do to anti-age your skin in terms of product besides wearing sunscreen which is in a category and a class all on its own so retinoids which include things like retinol retinal adaptolene teseratine triferitine tretinoin they can be over the counter or prescription and they do it all they support collagen synthesis so they help you make new collagen which makes your skin bouncy and glowy and less saggy fewer fine lines fewer wrinkles they help break up pigmentation in the skin they support new vessel growth and a lot of people are like oh i don't want new vessels but deeper in the skin which can really make your skin glow the other thing that they can do is they can actually fight something called cellular atypia so as your body is exposed to more uv damage over your life the cells in your top layer of skin can start misbehaving and that's what leads to skin cancer so as part of a skin cancer prevention treatment i put a lot of my patients on a topical retinoid retinoids increase collagen synthesis so collagen is the protein in our skin that makes it look bouncy and glowy and in our mid-20s we lose one percent of our collagen in our skin per year which is devastating so how do we combat that using a retinoid is the best way and that is why it is a staple in my routine it will never leave my routine unless i was trying to get pregnant or if i was pregnant the reason for that is that these are vitamin a derived compounds and they have been shown when taken orally to cause birth defects so no anti-aging in the world is worth a birth defect a lot of people will caution about using retinoids when someone's breastfeeding i personally would have no problem using a retinoid while i'm breastfeeding i'm not worried about a birth defect at that point the baby is out so just don't put it on your nipples and you'll be fine so most nights i will use a retinoid maybe once or twice a week depending if i feel like my skin is looking dull or if i just want to like a little extra i will do an exfoliating step instead of my retinoid i never use a chemical exfoliator plus a retinoid in the same night that is too much and overkill but one of my favorite chemical exfoliants are these peel pads by skin better they are a combination of lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid and then their own proprietary retinoid blend but when you take one of these and you swipe it over your face you get the sting okay that's the sting that tells you something's going down on your skin in a positive way i would not recommend doing a retinoid and this in the routine unless you're used to it basically otherwise you're going to over exfoliate your skin you're going to over aggravate your skin but for me i've been using a retinoid for six or seven years at this point and i need another exfoliating agent to just get some of that dead skin cell layer off the top so i can have a true glow and doing a peel pad or some type of exfoliating step usually a chemical exfoliating step not a physical scrub is what i like to do in my routine to just give me a little glow next after my retinoid is on i go in with a moisturizer this is the la roche-posay tolerane ultra this is a super mild but very hydrating moisturizer this is like five pumps i want a lot okay this is super thick and creamy it's basically like a pumpable cream usually i tell patients creams come in jars they're thick like frosting this is just just below that it is the thickest lotion you can imagine and i i adore this now it's on the back well this is going to be really smooth tomorrow but i probably use four or five times more moisturizer than i do of a retinoid i want more of it oh it just feels so good i like this because it feels really nourishing and no matter how angry or upset or if my rosacea's flared or if i overdid it with my retinoid and my skin feeling temperamental this never ever stings and i really appreciate that about this product i also see a lot of patients in my clinic who have sensitive skin who have allergies to things like fragrance or certain preservatives and this product just doesn't have any of those so i always feel really confident recommending it to people with sensitive skin because i think they'll be successful the only time i might not use something this sick is someone who's really acne prone who has a ton of clogged pores because it does have a lot of moisturizing and occlusive ingredients in it but oh i love it feels so good all right so retinoid is on moisturizer is on that's it it's the one two punch i mean it's pretty darn simple i do use something called azelaic acid in the morning to help combat my rosacea and i use vitamin c and sunscreen but in the evening for anti-aging retinoid and moisturizer now i don't exclusively rely on my skin care to contribute to my anti-aging plan or goals i do use neuromodulators so botox in my face to help with fine lines and wrinkles and creasing that happens over time i also do a mild resurfacing laser a few times a year something called clear and brilliant which helps break up pigment in my skin and also supports collagen synthesis the last thing i do is something called pulse dye laser so pulse dye laser is a laser that targets redness and you're probably looking at me going well i can see redness in your face oh you you can't even imagine what it would look like without the laser okay uh these tools that we have in a dermatology office are not to help someone achieve true you know there's no such thing as perfect we're just trying to optimize make someone feel more confident you don't need to look like an instagram filter that's not even a realistic goal you just need to look like you and feel confident in your own skin and sometimes a little enhancement never hurts anybody but i just want to be totally just totally transparent and that i get support from in-office procedures and i don't exclusively rely on my skin care if you're someone that does bravo but if you're someone who doesn't bravo to round out my nighttime skincare routine we cannot neglect the lips oftentimes i'll actually put my moisturizer on over my lips as well just to start softening them and then i'll go in with something more occlusive so something with a more jelly like or vaseline texture to really lock everything in so i'm going to use my aquaphor oldie but a goodie as you can see that's like a pretty thick i mean it's 40 vaseline or petrolatum excuse me and so i'll just put that on my lips to get everything nice and hydrated the rest i rub on my cuticles so in a clinic day you know i see 20 to 35 patients in a day and i wash my hands probably a hundred times that's sadly not even an exaggeration and so my hands take a huge beating so part of my nighttime routine focuses on my hands so anytime i showed you any of these steps any leftover got rubbed down my neck on and onto the back of my hands and that's really important to me but now i've got my retinoid on my moisturizer on the skin has been properly cleansed the lips are feeling juicy i think i'm getting ready to go to bed that's it thank you so much for following along in my nighttime anti-aging low maintenance skincare routine i just wanted to show you that even as a dermatologist who has access to all of the things this is what i choose now just because that's what my routine is it doesn't mean that's what your routine has to be but you should know that you can work smarter not harder and that an effective skincare routine does not have to be extensive or expensive it can be if you want it to but it certainly doesn't have to be if you would like more skincare tips from me and just to follow me around the office see what the day in the life of a dermatologist is like hear me talk about dermatologic procedures and medical dermatology you should follow me on instagram my handle is super creative it's at dr samantha ellis i would love to see you there this has been a blast and a huge honor thank you so much for having me bye",

        "transcript": "hello to say it's been a hot minute is a drastic understatement but what I'm glad to report is that my skin is clear my rosacea people say it's incurable I don't care I never believed it I never wanted to believe it so I kept searching for me it's been since 2016 and it's now 2023. it's about time I would say and in this video I want to share with you uh the things that have really helped me have changed and revolutionized my skin I spent a long time believing that it was difficult to heal and that the more pain I put myself through the stretch of the regimen the more likely it was that I was doing the right thing and that I would get better that was never the case and I've had times where I feel like I've healed and then I've backtracked I got mold poisoning and everything came back even with a Vengeance I became you know having reactions to all types of food when I had made so much progress before and I just thought when is enough enough and it was actually last year in August when I got I was before August it was in June last year when I got covered and I got significantly worse again everything got re-triggered and activated and I was just fed up and you know in those moments where you go nut enough is enough what I'm doing is not working it has gotten me this far it's not getting me any further and you hit this like roadblock and it's so frustrating and you just want to cry and you're overwhelmed I hit that point back in June 2022 and I turned around and went I'm doing it differently so I met this friend through my blog in the raw and I had helped her with her rosacea journey and she came back around and swung back around and helped me with my rosacea Journey now her recommendation to me was to try particular products this is not a sponsored ad I have nothing to do with anything I would never do that um but I'm just going to share with you what worked because I think I owe it to you and I've I've recommended it to multiple different people and the results that they've had has just been amazing uh because it works and all of a sudden what I found in my health Journey was that it went from being super difficult to being very clear this is getting rid of the cause I don't have to like starve myself and worry about everything being just so otherwise I'm going to have this awful reaction which is what it was all of a sudden I'm getting better and better and I can eat I was so happy and it was such a relief because every day my skin is getting consistently better consistently better consistently better and it's just like for the first time it's not get a bit better get a little bit worse get a bit better get a little bit worse and just like this journey of just uncertainty and like is it this is it that enough you know we have to deal with enough things that we shouldn't be having to worry you know constantly about what we eat about changing our pillow every five minutes about worrying about touching our face and just all these like finicky things that we we obsess over when we have such severe issues we think oh if we do all these miniature things like then my skin will be okay as if it's your fault that your skin is not okay that you are doing something fundamentally wrong well sometimes it's about finding the root of how it occurred and allowing yourself to enjoy life and ease into the things that you want to ease into um so this is what these products did for me and oh I should probably show you what they are I didn't organize that very well this is a bit impromptu so the products that I started using were recommended by my friend who also had a severe formal rosacea very similar presentation to mine we have very different Journeys but very similar presentation and I was super skeptical at first I was I it actually she recommended to me nine months earlier and I kept thinking to myself I wish I tried this earlier uh but who cares it was perfect timing that's just the same it was perfect timing so I tie the products I but before I did I start going no like I just nosedive into all of this person's content he was originally a doctor dermatologist who got sick of the fact that the typical way that Dermatology functions the options are laser antibiotics or anti-inflammatories all of which can cause a lot of damage and for many of you I know because I speak to so many people around the world their rosacea got significantly worse after taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatories because it exacerbates the underlying cause now controversial thing to say but I'm going to say it so he started questioning that and started formulating uh and researching to what might work and rosacea is such a complex skin condition it seems to be one of the most difficult skin conditions and the one that doctors seem to believe cannot be eradicated cannot be reversed but I have reversed the vast majority of my allergies before I get to the solution I just want to share with you something so exciting for the past three weeks I have been eating gluten I've been eating all these things that I normally would be like I'm never eating that again it's so bad for you um and just enjoying food and just loving life um so uh and I still listen to my body anyway the point is let's get to the product so I started using and researching and deep diving into a product called as osmosis or a brand called osmosis I began with their rescue serum uh which helped with my dry painful red and flaky skin it was so painful and so red I'll show you before and afters um I mean you can see the after but the befores of when I start before I started using these products it's just crazy like the inflammation not just the redness and the bumps I had like a nose bump like this but also the puffiness of my eyes the swelling of my cheeks like I also had like a double chin um even though I'm the same size so I was just overall really inflamed and swollen and that's because it's autoimmune issues now I thought on the rescue and immediately I felt insane relief like previously I had been putting on so much Derma vigils like just slapping on the lipids just to try and almost like a Vaseline just like trying to cover my um my barrier so that it would not be leaking moisture all the time because it was so itchy and so sore I was applying it multiple times a day I couldn't go anywhere without it I would never ever dream of you know not cleansing my face or going through my routine if I woke up I immediately had to go to the bathroom and wash my face because I was in agony always when I wake up when I go to bed now sometimes I forget to wash my face I actually don't know who I am anymore I'm pretty good though like it's it's not a regular occurrence but that's the level I don't it it's not like an everyday Obsession because it's not painful it's it's livable I mean it's pretty good so okay rescue fantastic product it's a DNA Repair Serum it helps to heal scars does all these things for collagen look it up um I'll probably put some links below uh so that you can have a little bit of a look-see but Dr Ben Johnson has so much so many YouTube videos online I'll tell you all the other things that I also used as well so I started with rescue and I also started with regenerate which was a liver it's meant to help regenerate the liver and help the liver so Dr Ben's theory is that with rosacea it's either liver induced or it's candida introduced and he has things on the website to determine what that is you can also email him uh and I'll put his email down below you can email him personally and he will respond to you um for free so that's really generous um it's getting harder and harder for him to do it within you know a week or so but it's worth it regenerate he told me I needed to go on it for nine months I hit the nine month Mark I think a month ago um and now I'm off all the internal products and my skin stays consistently really good it's improving all the time every month and so regenerate was the second one I also after I started doing the regenerate I was making a lot of progress but I wasn't making it's like I was making progress in some areas of my skin and not in other areas and when I sent some photos to Dr Ben he said you also have candida rosacea so I went on his candida protocol as well as the liver protocol and I started as I was detoxing my skin that's why I started with the rescue because it helps detox as well detox and heal after I started with the rescue I started adding other elements into my regimen but if it was causing the detox to happen too strongly I would pair back and wait I think it took me three months before I could go on some of these other repair serums I went on stem factor which helps with like collagen and scarring and then I also wanted to try Catalyst Ace 11. once you start learning about all these incredible products and what they do for your skin it's like I want to try I want to try but you have to slow down and so I now have implemented I've got stem Factor rescue the um correct serum I started off with calm which is better for rosacea skin you start off with calm and then uh Catalyst ac11 every now and again um and that's really good for elasticity and it's just all of it helps with different things for the skin especially when you're doing repair like I've had almost what seven years of skin damage and breakage to make up for so my skin is loving it the first thing I realized when I put this topical stuff on my skin was oh it's fading my skin my my skin feels fed uh so that was really great and then um yeah so you can look up what his candida protocol is it's um something called uh you take these capsules called clarify it helps you clear out mucus which apparently is what candida different types of candida feeds off and then you take this like spray Elixir thing which helps reduce the population of the candida so I did that for three months and noticed significant effects and then I just continued to improve as I continue to take regenerate and I also took his fat supplement which I forget the name of at this point in time uh that one's really amazing as well I took that for three months because I in the past had really bad I just I just didn't have enough natural oils and lipids in my skin um that's also something that could help aid your skin as well as not having enough oils because I wasn't absorbing it because my liver wasn't functioning properly so I wasn't absorbing fat and I've noticed like I used to have a lot of pulling like my skin was pulling and tight because it didn't have enough lipids and fats and I've done you know a lot of skin scans now and the pulling is no longer there so my skin is now like having this vibrant lipid look the youthful look or whatever I know I'm younger whatever I did have like all these what appeared to be like all these Fine Lines because my skin was so dry I would highly recommend giving it a go emailing Dr Ben again this isn't sponsored but I just wanted to give you guys an update because I want more people to know about what works and at the end of the day it's all about having a better relationship with your body learning to love yourself more and living the most vibrant life you can so you can start giving to others one of the things that I struggle with the most and I think we do struggle with in self-esteem when your skin severely affects your life especially with more severe skin conditions or ones that are autoimmune related they really significantly can impact your life and it impacts your ability to contribute to the world to actualize yourself to Greater to Greater degrees it might affect travel it might affect the activities you participate in it may affect the you know the confidence level of you to be able to make contacts and friends and further yourself and your career it might reduce your ability to earn and therefore give back to society maybe you want to make more contributions to Charities causes all these things like it affects every area of your life and people don't realize the significant impact and so that's why I'm sharing this with you because I feel like the past nine months of my life 10 months I think it's 10 or 11 months now I can't even count anymore I've just lost track have been transformed because of this so let me know how you go let me know your thoughts let me know if you've tried it before and yeah I would love to see how it helps you and if you tried it as a result of watching this video anyway lots of love to you and um good luck on your skin Journey",

        "transcript": "for me what do you like about corn [Music] it's cold I don't know they stopped I did not know this song I don't know this horror song no my name is Dr shock Dr Maxfield welcome back to our Channel Dr Lee where we talk about all things skin care and dermatology today this is our Series where we talk about viral skin care products and whether or not we think that they're worth it today we're talking about the La Roche Posay secoplast B5 bomb a bomb on social media we just got demonetized well you won't be watching any ads on this video today we're talking about this product that has got Mega viral worldwide from La Roche Posay and in this video they're making claims that it helps acne so let's talk about all things related to this product here we go here we go foreign let's talk about the packaging first outside it comes in a box this is a small box that fits the tube nicely it's fairly average and it's a tube it's a tube there's nothing special about the packaging packaging gets zero out of ten it functions a functional pack so five out of ten I guess that'll be it's a very average very average packaging let's talk about why did it even go viral in the first place this one this just won't go away I don't know why like I like it well I guess whether I kind of like this product but it keeps coming back so first is like this amazing moisturizer and then it's like with wound healing and then is it is it actually a spot treatment for acne that seems to be a thing and then I keep thinking we're done and it just keeps going back and then there was some controversy surrounding the formula because one everyone loved it it was viral they used it to help their skin and then they decided to change the formula in Europe which everyone hates it when a company changes their formula for a product that they always loved but they decided to add some some type of barrier repairing probiotics to them in Europe not in the U.S so it's the formula is unchanged in the U.S right now but they do have some new ingredients in Europe that people were pretty upset I'm going to call you out La Roche but say at this moment I might have your attention for this one second time this might be the clunkiest rollout I've ever seen because and maybe this was deliberate but yeah you stage stage release there but not here like is it ever going to come Global or U.S when I have no idea but also you change products too much like you have a lot of good products I love and you just change them slightly in retweek maybe it's deliberate but I don't like it I think there's different regulations in Europe and the US and because La Roche passes is a global brand you get these changes that they need to make to one one maybe not another formula or the distribution is different it doesn't make it to the U.S but the other thing to consider is that they also change the names of the formulas which is also frustrating it is too one of my favorite products La Roche Posay lipicard AP plus which they changed the name again of that product right so then when I'm recommending it to patients they're like it doesn't exist now I'm like oh yes it's just gone stop changing your product names if you have to change the formulas because you have to change the formulas I mean we can't say anything about that but stop changing the names of the products when people learn them all right so next up let's talk about the ingredients because that's the real focus and the Heart of La Roche but say La Roche passe is a brand that is a derm-backed brand you know a lot of dermatologists recommend it they actually have a skin Center in France where they treat people with their thermal spring water and they actually do a lot of philanthropic things which I think are pretty cool you know it's actually really interesting the lipicard moisturizer is approved to treat radiation dermatitis for people that have Cancers and people that have cancers that are treated with radiation they get a lot of damage to Their Skin Barrier and they actually did clinical studies which is such a small group of people to do a clinical study on it's not a big population that's going to necessarily benefit but it's a very important population let's talk about the ingredients here so this has an active ingredient what does that mean an active ingredient is regulated as a drug in the United States which means that most of your Cosmetics are not regulated by the f FDA but if you see something on the top that says active ingredient and you'll see this in your sunscreens that means that it is regulated by the FDA and this has an ingredient called dimethicone in it and dimethicone is regulated as a skin protectant so the mothicone is interesting actually maybe you can even educate me I don't know why it's an active ingredient like why not an inactive ingredient it's not highly functional like a tretinoin or a sunscreen or something like that it's often added to a product for an assisting role where dimethicone can be added to a petrolatum based product to make it feel less greasy or thick it also can work maybe to help the skin vary a little bit some controversy in its role and inclusiveness and trans epidermal water loss like our travel have gone back and forth on that behind the scenes but it's an emollient helps kind of fill the space between skin cells and it makes things more aesthetically pleasing but it also is a silicone derivative product silicone we know functionally is great for helping scars and wounds I think that's one of the reasons why you know as a skin protect there's a colloidal oatmeal is also regulated in the same way is considered an act active ingredient and this gives it more like just like you said you know it's helpful for scars um you know how anti-inflammatory helps to repair the Skin Barrier dimethicone is very well studied to show that they have these types of results now the next thing is that you have the vitamin B5 which is uh panthenol panthenol is a very powerful antioxidant that is also very beneficial calming and soothing for the skin yeah it's great for the skin bear so panthenol is a derivative of pantothenic acid that's just better absorbed and more effective in the skin itself now panthenol is unique and the mechanisms are actually really poorly understood with how this works sometimes which is kind of frustrating for me but one of the ways it works is through the COA synthetase enzyme I believe or the COA pathway in in the involvement of the production of cholesterol and lipids for the Skin Barrier so that's one of the ways it helps promote Skin Barrier also been studying wound healing it's really actually a very very good supporting ingredient I love it every time I see it I think it's interesting that they emphasize it so heavily in this line but it is a great supporting ingredient and then you also have calming and soothing scentile asiatica extract madagasa side and they've actually changed when you look at the European formula they changed the madagasa side on the ingredient list to centella extract because it is a centella extract and nobody knew what madagasaside was so so now you have centella in that ingredient list but essentially the same thing and I like cintella it's very good for redness very good for inflammation very calming and soothing and so nice in the in the formula and what it's trying to accomplish in a very deliberate way which is really important to us yeah let's see another supporting ingredients that we're just going through the list here you know it has glycerin a great humectant that also has some moisturizing properties shea butter which is really nice moisturizing ingredient just not a lot of data on it but it is nice in products can be helpful it does have silica which actually makes sense actually how it feels because silica helps absorb oil and this is definitely a moisturizer that does not leave you kind of dewy and moist and wet and buttery certainly does not do that that pretty much sums it up as far as I think the main recognizable names in this product and then what it doesn't have it doesn't have fragrance it doesn't have essential oils so you know very good for sensitive skin overall that's pretty much this is the ingredient list but let's kind of dive in as far as the performance of the product and what you can expect to see when you use it because of the ingredients because of the focus because of the feel and the heaviness of the product this is really meant to be a barrier repairing type of product to me right so good as a moisturizer good as barrier repair good to calm and soothe inflammation good for dry cracked hands to me it's not necessarily good for acne but it's also not bad for acne there have been some studies that have shown that when you add dimethicone to your acne ingredients so basically if you have like an ingredient like benzyl peroxide and you add dimethicone to it it can make it more tolerable right so it's it's good in addition to an acne routine but it's not meant to like in a lot of our videos even the video that we featured here they showed it as an acne treatment but it's more of an ingredient to support your acne treatments and I do think it's a good part of an acne routine but it's not going to cure your acne without any other ingredients please so this if anything would function to help a wound healing part of an acne bump and maybe a little bit of inflammation but there's really not a strong like dedicated anti-inflammatory component it's not like that strong this actually answers and kind of comes alongside of one important question like should you moisturize when you have acne and this moisturizer is kind of heavier but it would actually function very well to offset irritation from either the acne active ingredients or just help the open acne bumps heal as they should be naturally progressing absolutely so and and I really think it has a better place in people who have eczema dry skin lip licorice dermatitis irritation irritate like contact dermatitis on your hands because of that protectant effect of the dimethicone and then the other ingredients that are calming and see the inflammation I really find it a nice ingredient even for like stretch marks I could see it playing a role because of the centella in it plus the dimethicone which is helpful for scars so you know I think it could be even a scar treatment to some extent that's interesting I would say yeah for probably non-mature scars or like early scarring it might be helpful in that way you know I think that's kind of just a thought game mind bubble mind play we're just thinking out loud here but it might be helpful in that way as well Dr shotgun nailed it here this is like fragrance free extremely gentle let's talk about now like feel and fit touch of the product how does It Blend into the skin do we like it do we hate it it's thick so a lot of the La Roche Posse moisturizers leave behind a nice hydrating film which I personally appreciate I think it really lasts a long time and helps throughout the day this one is like borderline sunscreen thick yes it's like it's like a mineral sunscreen thick it's it like grips your skin so um definitely you know and because it's heavier you know it is going to be able to lock in those lipids better it's going to be able to lock in that moisture better it's going to be better at preventing trans epidermal water loss theoretically but it's not like the best blending uh Sun moisturizer that you've ever had in your life I'll tell you that much yeah this is very much a functional moisturizer like Dr it serves its purpose well I think for sensitive irritated skin sensitive irritated dry skin especially here in the winter perfect I think this is amazing and it does blend like it does eventually blend out but it's definitely not it is not your lightweight moisturizer you know what I think you could use this to slug you oh so you think that this is heavy enough to be your last slugs to I think it is I mean it's not as effective because we you know we prefer petrolatum based products to slug because it's the most effective occlusive moisturizer but I think if someone wanted something a little bit more lightweight a reasonable slugging step I think yeah I think I think you agree okay so then the last piece of this is let's compare it to another moisturizer from La Roche but say which is their lipicard AP plus and I'm gonna go grab it yeah this is one of my favorites of all time for the winter another one of our favorites which is the lipicar AP plus bomb moisturizing cream no longer called that even though this is not finished yet they've decided to change the name and call it the triple moisturizing cream is that what it's called now I'm pretty sure yeah um but this again is a I'm going to use on a different part of my arm just so that we can compare them side by side and this one is actually grown on me more and more each winter season uh at first I was like okay maybe this is too heavy for me I don't love it as much but as my skin gets drier with age I'm and the size of the bottle and the price of the bottle I am becoming more and more obsessed with this product it locks in hydration all day all night um it doesn't feel too greasy after it rubs in it Blends better than this um the psychoplast bomb and it just overall is an amazing product completely agree yeah I mean I'm obsessed with it obsessed obsessed obsessed like my skin gets beat up in the winter from surfing and all this crazy coldness um so it comparably though I think it's lighter it's lighter than the zika blast balm and because of that I think it's more generalizably tolerable I think more people would use it especially actually in the setting of The Face you know the secret pass balm is small enough for like face the hands but I think this triple moisturizing cream or whatever it is now actually functions well for the same person and I think they're different products but if you're looking for more of a consistent moisturizer that you'd want to use for kind of all skin types or drier skin I would go with the triple moisturizing cream but if you're looking for something that to kind of more not spot treat but like very targeted treat your dermatitis any any like contact dermatitis irritant dermatitis eczema even to kind of heal acne bumps afterwards as a skin protectant I I do like the sequel plasma mom as a treatment for that I think it fits its dedicated purpose well so if you go to their website nowhere on there does it say it treats acne right this is this is a thick moisturizer sensitive dry irritated skin and it fits that perfectly so I'm all on board with that I think as far as like how it's grown on social media it doesn't quite fit where it's taken off to but I think overall the product is very good as far as grades it's like a solid like omnivorous mammal it's it's very good and functional with a lot of good roles so the last thing we have to talk about is the price and this Falls in at 15 which is very reasonable for what it performs the ingredients the thoughtfulness so overall we have a pretty good great even product I would actually say that this is completely worth its virality I think that you know it's kind of like a game of telephone is a great product for certain things like your like your irritation of the skin and then it started to like the problem is that people don't know why other people are using it and then they use it for everything and then the spillover like it started out as probably the right thing and then it spilled over into being used for things that probably isn't as helpful for like treating active acne that being said I think it's a great product to have especially for somebody who suffers from dry irritated skin so overall I think it deserves its virality buy it with purpose but definitely doctorally approved definitely let us know what's which products you want us to review next we're going to be making this a larger Series where we review products one by one thank you all so much for tuning in please like comment and subscribe we'll see you in the next video we'll see you next time foreign",

        "transcript": "I'm back with another affordable skincare routine this is a morning routine focused on repairing Your Skin [Music] Barrier if you're new to the channel welcome I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good don't forget to subscribe to the channel and like this video I'm actually thrilled that people are coming around to the idea of supporting and repairing their skin barrier now it is a little bit redundant to say Skin Barrier because in and of itself skin is a barrier it's what divides your external World from your insides that being said your skin is made up of several different cellular layers and as you get closer to the surface of the skin or those outermost cellular layers those are the skin cells that serve the most protective role so really when we're talking about repairing and protecting the Skin Barrier we are talking about using products and using skin practices that help keep that surface layer of skin cells intact the way I like to describe it to my patients is your outermost layer of skin cells are like bricks and those bricks or skin cells are held together by mortar and in your skin that mortar is made up of a complex of proteins and lipids or proteins and fats now when you have a disruption in Your Skin Barrier it can be because the cells themselves or the bricks have an issue or it can be because the mortar or the protein and lipid complex that is holding those skin cells or bricks together has an issue and sometimes it can be both in fact in the world of medical Dermatology there are numerous skin disorders in which people are unable to produce these proteins and fats that create Their Skin Barrier or they produce dysfunctional proteins or fats and because of this these people often will have skin dryness skin flaking blistering skin fragility increased skin infections Etc because they are unable to create a strong Skin Barrier to protect themselves now something that's much more common than being born with a Skin Barrier disorder is actually being born with healthy fully functioning skin but then doing something to your skin for example overe exfoliating that then goes and disrupts that Skin Barrier and I feel like we've all done that before we think we're doing a skincare routine that's going to help us with our fine lines and wrinkles or our acne and we wake up the next day and our skin feels dry and tight it might be red it might be flaking it might be burning and stinging when we put our products on and that's a sign that our Skin Barrier is struggling and since most of us have been in that situation before and I'm assuming you have because you're watching this video I wanted to give you a skincare routine that you can use to help restore or repair Your Skin Barrier and give you one that's affordable okay let's get into the routine I wanted to make you a morning routine because I feel like there's a good number of nighttime skincare barrier repair routines out there and of course if you want me to make you one of those I certainly can but Skin Barrier repair needs to be in the morning as well and one of the core principles of skin barrier repair is eliminating actives from your routine so at night that means getting rid of your retinoids and maybe your exfoliating acids and often in the morning that means taking out vitamin C because that is a skincare active and it can be irritating for a lot of people so less is best when it comes to repairing your barrier okay so first step in a routine cleansing now I'm going to recommend that if your Skin Barrier is disrupted and it's not feeling great that you just cleanse with water yes that is perfectly okay and I've had so many people tell me that just by changing their routine from washing twice a day to just washing in the evening has made their skin less sensitive and overall feel better so I just have some lukewarm water running here and I'm just going to get my hands wet and just sort of massage that into my face I don't need to wash off the products I wore last night they've sort of rubbed off on my pillow or absorbed into my skin by now and then I'm going to gently Pat my skin dry No harsh rubbing okay okay first step of my morning routine is done and it cost absolutely nothing so I feel like we're staying on budget so for most days at this point in my routine I would go in with my vitamin C but again we're skipping all skincare actives so instead while my skin is still I'm going to go in with a hydrating skin serum and just to give you a preview I'm going to go in with a hydrating serum then a moisturizer then a sunscreen and depending on what your skin is feeling like whether you tend to lean oily or dry or are acne prone or just how many products you want to have in your routine some of these steps are optional I would say sunscreen is never optional but whether you do a hydrating serum and then your sunscreen or just a moisturizer and then your sunscreen or do all three steps like I'm going to demonstrate for you today you just want to make sure that your including steps only because you need them and not just because you think you should have them in your routine so reasons why you might want to do a serum and a moisturizer because for a lot of people a moisturizer is going to be absolutely enough and for some people even just using their sunscreen as their moisturizer will be completely adequate but I like to go in with a hydrating serum because often times in these hydrating serums one of the principal ingredients is something called A humant and A humant is just a category of skincare ingredients that helps draw water to the Skin's surface and I find When My Skin Barrier is disrup Ed my skin tends to look a little bit depleted it looks dry the fine lines are emphasized like my skin just doesn't look great and so I like using a hydrating serum to help bring that water to my skin surface to plump it out a bit also depending on which serum you're using it may have additional beneficial skincare ingredients that are not contained within your moisturizer or within your sunscreen so it's an opportunity to introduce new beneficial skincare ingredients into your routine so today I'm going in with the aino calm and restore triple oat serum and I believe this retail anywhere from $15 to $20 depending on where you're buying it from as the name of the product suggests it's meant to calm and restore your skin bear now this dropper mechanism not my favorite but not horrible you can see it's on the thicker side but when you go to spread it so smooth it's great and I find that this layers really well with moisturizer and other products so I like to kind of put it on right away while my skin is damp to really trap that moisture there so for my face I'm probably going to put at least one dropper I think I need a second one all right two droppers full massage it on so this has glycerin which is the humant ingredient that I was talking about before that helps draw water to your skin surface and helps plump it out a little bit aeno is also pretty well known for including oat derivatives in its products and oats have soothing properties they have antioxidant properties so that's also all going to help restore your Skin Barrier so I'm just sort of massaging this around pressing it into my skin and of course bringing it down the neck so I found with using this product it feels a little bit tacky or sticky to the touch for about 30 seconds and then it pretty much completely dries down and once it's drag down then I go in with the third step of my routine so first step was cleanse with water Second Step hydrating serum and now moisturizer the moisturizer I'm going to go in with today is the deride relief barrier moisturizer what an appropriate Name by purito this is like a good siiz moisturizer you get a lot of product in here I think it retails for about 20 bucks and I'll just show you the texture here it's thick and creamy but I find not too heavy so I can wear it during the day but absolutely could use this as a nighttime moisturizer as well I feel like it sort of straddles the Daytime Nighttime moisturizer thickness quite well and you can see rubs in beautifully I'm going to use about a pump a little more than a p sized amount perhaps at night I tend to use more moisturizer and during the day I tend to use if I'm using moisturizer at all a smaller amount and the reason for that is I'm going to go in with another layer of skincare afterward my sunscreen and I just find that if I use a ton of moisturizer and then try to put my sunscreen on top I just I don't like how it feels on my skin and then sometimes I also can get peeling of the product where it starts to ball up into these little white balls on the skin and that's not cute super annoying you have to restart start your skincare routine so just a dim sized amount of moisturizer for me today again don't forget the neck there we go while I'm waiting for this moisturizer to dry down a little bit before I go in with my sunscreen I'll tell you the reason why I like this particular moisturizer so much is because of the valuable skincare ingredients that it has that support the Skin Barrier it contains some calming plant oils it also has allantoin and squalene and cholesterol and then the main sort of selling point of this moisturizer is the variety of ceramides that it contains and remember back at the beginning of this video when I was talking about how your skin cells are like the bricks of Your Skin Barrier and then you have this complex of fats and proteins that form the mortar to seal those skin cells or those bricks together well ceramides are a key component of that lipid protein matrix that helps seal your barrier so when your Skin Barrier is depleted or not functioning in an ideal way using products that have ceramides in them can help repair that barrier and bring it back to its original function and with that we will move on to the fourth and final step of this affordable morning skincare routine to support your Skin Barrier and of course we're going to end with the best it's sunscreen now a lot of people don't realize that your Skin Barrier actually helps protect your deeper layers of skin from UV damage so when you have a disrupted Skin Barrier your ability for your skin to protect itself from UV radiation goes down so sunscreen of course is going to be essential for skin barrier repair routine in the morning and honestly for any skin routine in the morning the sunscreen I'm going to use today is a Korean sunscreen it's from a brand called called belflower it's the avocado moisture sunscreen SPF 50 pa+++ plus let's get this on I just put a layer of that sunscreen on and totally didn't record it so I'm going to go in and put another layer on for you but you can see it leaves a really nice dewy finish and that's one thing I really like about this sun green is it's very lightweight but feels quite hydrating on the skin it has some amazing UV filters in it and it also has some great ingredients that help support Your Skin Barrier so it has niacinamide it has cantella asiatica which is anti-inflammatory and I think most importantly it just goes on so well and that might sound silly to prioritize that above all else when it comes to sunscreen but the best sunscreen is the one you will wear so finding one that has a texture that you like is essential so that's all dried down now I think it has a really beautiful Luminous Finish and for a dry skinned gal like me that is basically ideal I forgot to mention that this sunscreen generally retails from anywhere between 122 and $15 so highly affordable which I also love because I don't want anyone skimping on their sunscreen or even worse skipping their sunscreen because it's too expensive everyone should be able to afford sunscreen okay you've reached the end of this routine I hope you found it helpful if you want to see other types of affordable skincare routines let me know in the comments so I can make those for you also if you have any skin barrier repair products that you love throw them in the comments as well as always thank you so much for watching don't forget to like this video And subscribe to the channel and I'll see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning good morning welcome back to the Vlog today I am GNA of course start my skincare routine and I was thinking about those of you out there with Rosa you deal with burning stinging symptoms of sensitivity when you use your skincare products with rosacea people develop redness on the cheeks little bumps that are red and filled with pus but in people who have deeper skin tones those skin signs sometimes are missed um or are not as obvious especially to the untrained eye and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up getting misdiagnosed and they have rosacea so talking about symptoms with your doctor is one of the most helpful pieces of information for guiding the diagnosis of Ros but symptoms include burning stinging itch sensations of warmth in the face that come and go as well as discomfort in the eyes and of course problems with skin care products and cosmetics if you have rosacea cleansing can be a really delicate tricky balance because definitely can burn and sting and can wear away at your already kind of weaken Skin Barrier to make those symptoms of sensitivity worse a lot of cleansers burn and sting so use a really gentle mild creamy cleanser if you're feeling really sensitive use lukewarm water and try just washing your face once a day cleansing oils and cleansing balms are a great option to remove um dirt oil and Cosmetics first because they're less likely to burn and sting got to get the drips off all right I'm coming in with the healthy renew face serum I've really been enjoying this now this would be a good option for a lightweight hydrating serum if you have sensitive skin because this whole product line is meant for people with sensitive skin and it's moisturizing to help minimize the symptoms of sensitivity but it's this particular Serum is not heavy sometimes heavy moisturizers for people with rosacea can actually elicit a flush not everyone but some people so the face cream in this line I really like but it is very rich so if you are sensitive to really heavy moisturizers and you want something more lightweight go with the serum for my sunscreen today I'm going to use a cavey hydrating sheer sunscreen I reviewed this a while ago it's a hybrid sunscreen it's water resistant um it's all right um but I want to use it up you know I buy these products to try out and review and then I want to make sure I finish them so they don't go to waste this hybrid sunscreen is more the consistency is more of a almost a fluid it kind of is like a cross between a fluid and a cream hybrid sunscreen just means zinc plus some organic AKA chemical filters so the cast in I find is a lot less noticeable in comparison to an all mineral but I also find that these hybrid sunscreens are a lot less likely to sting in comparison to the organic AKA chemical sunscreens so if you find that organic sunscreens chemical sunscreens burn sting but you're put off by the heavy white cast of an all mineral sunscreen try a hybrid sunscreen it's a nice balance it's not a zero cast though if you have a deeper skin tone it will show up but it is a lot less noticeable and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up using the hybrid sunscreens and they say you know after a while it just kind of Blends in and it's not so bad it all depends on your background skin tone though I wish these Brands would provide samples that way you know how it's going to look on your skin before you buy the bottle because while I like to think my reviews help you guys in deciding whether or not you're going to buy something or not you can't really tell just looking at how a product looks on my skin how it's necessarily going to look for you anytime somebody leaves a comment in any one of my videos like saying is this a good sunscreen for oily skin almost always either on a video or like a Tik Tok or something almost always there'll be someone who's like I've got oily skin I love this it's my Holy Grail then there'll be another P person who's like no stay away it's too greasy it's too oily so even those you know those kinds of things it's like you kind of just have to try it for yourself honestly um to see if it ends up working this one is a little bit shiny it's water resistant though which is nice like for humidity and sweat easy to tolerate around the eyes for me again that's another very individualized thing one thing too about sunscreen is that it also helps with the impaired skin barrier and helps reduce symptoms of sensitivity once you have it on there because it's you know helping to reduce water loss and limit penetration and irritance into the skin it's almost like a barrier cream in a sense depending on the consistency especially and sunscreens like this with zinc um are soothing you know zinc can be is anti-inflammatory although some zinc sunscreens are in my experience and yours cuz you guys have told me on the drawing side so I mentioned to you guys the other day that this like new thing that I've been enjoying doing is listening to my audio book which I'm still making my way through um it's called Uh Crossroads anyway so at night to unwind like when I'm making dinner I like to put my headphones on and just listen to the audiobook it kind of helps me tune out and like keeps me from you know Doom scrolling in my mind of just like things that I need to do and it just helps me inwind anyway but you know something about that like you've got to wash behind your ears is the point I'm trying to make like it's a it's an area where a lot of people end up forgetting to wash but um especially if you're wearing headphones a lot because back here you can get a lot of oily buildup and CC dermatitis I actually like to use an anti-dandruff shampoo back here to to clean behind my ears this is an area where you know similar to dandruff on your scalp and SE dermatitis on your face you can get this oily flaky itchy inflame buildup so I like to do that and when you're wearing headphones a lot that creates a moist humid environment that's really more favorable for that little yees malesia so it can make you know this kind of problem behind the ears even more of an issue for you so stay on top of clean it behind your ears kids so I bought this blood pressure monitor cuff on Amazon I've been pretty happy with it because it will syn to an app on your phone so you can keep a log of your blood pressure and heart rate I find that is something that's really useful a useful metric like I'm not I try to not get too into like tracking all these Health metrics because it's sort of like what are you going to do with all that information then you just become like you know somebody who just writes down numbers all the time like how many steps you got in a day like how many hours of sleep and it just becomes like to what end you know what I mean but uh all that to say having a Rec of your blood pressure readings over a period of time it can be a very useful information uh to provide to your doctor because a lot of people um deal with what they call white coat hypertension meaning your blood pressure goes up in the doctor's office cuz maybe you're nervous stressed out um they call it white coat hypertension like because they attribute it to being nervous about the doctor but honestly it's gotten to a point where the amount of time you have to wait in a doctor's office is so frustrating that it gets your blood pressure up too so it should be like um you know waiting room waiting room hypertension like the stress of of having to wait anyway um so I got this and I've been really happy with it the cuff is um standard size and it it also will fit a large larger arm and it's been doing well so yeah it's it's useful and I I think you know like I said what what good are all these numbers well like if you go to the doctor's office and you have a higher a blood pressure reading on the higher end they're probably you know going to tell you to maybe check it again and you know it can kind of be a thing so having this and having a record to show them is really helpful because a lot of times your blood pressure will will run a certain way and it'll be very different in the office so that's handy to have I've got my little pumpkin back there I'm still burning the Tuscany trick-or treat candle the cupcake one it's not my favorite favorite scent I think I've complained about this already in multiple Vlogs and I have re I purchased a new another candle on their Halloween set that I'm I'm itching to buy I'm itching to to light into but I have this thing in my personality where like with the candle I'm going to burn it unless it's like really really foul which this is isn't it's just kind of like you know I know Tuscany can give a better candle profile um unless it's just really foul I'm going to burn that thing all the way and I'm not going to start a new candle until I finished it some people burn more than one candle at a time and let the the fragrances like mingle and I bet that's really nice if you get the right pairing but I'm always like on the fence about if I should do that or if it's going to be like weird and and and mess things up like I think one of my favorite to skinny candles is the Lemon sugar cookie and I really think that the lemon sugar cookie would be nice over like some of those more Berry scents I think that would be like a nice kind of way to blend those two but I don't know what would go good with cupcake maybe a cinnamon scented candle so it was a gorgeous day on this Sunday I had to get out I could not spend it inside as you can see the sky is really really blue and gorgeous I'm over by the River Oaks neighborhood where they're all these Mansions I love to drive by these houses and just Ogle them lot of them have these like massive walls in front of them so you can't really see them too well but over the holidays this neighborhood is really fun to come to because they go all out lighting up their mansions and they all look beautiful uh it's just something to see something to behold I wanted to go to Memorial Park um and so that's a bit of a drive but it kind of ended up to be a fail because actually I could not find a parking space uh because everybody wanted to get out which like I've said in other Vlogs I try and get outside as much as possible during the day it's actually really good for your sleep cycle for your mental health to get outside in during daylight hours and spend time Outdoors uh as much as possible like especially if you work swing shifts can really help set your clock back so because I couldn't find a place to park I ended up coming over to Rice Village uh area and they have that nice walking trail uh getting some Cloud footage here I just think it's so Zen but I used to walk around this uh Park a lot um in my older apartment but I I haven't been here in a while it's always a fun time let me know in the comments I think some of you went to Rice so hopefully this footage brings back fond memories of your own stomping grounds but uh I love the pretty oak trees that line This walking path I did not know that this existed this Garden back here it's for the students but I had to come and check it out they have all sorts of beautiful flowers the garden was actually closed but you can it is open to the I guess open to the public um during certain hours yeah here's a little sign I guess um some alumni donated money for this garden and the idea is like to have a space for students to come and like learn about gardening so maybe one day they will have their own garden all right so I am going to show you guys some double cleansing in action here uh this particular night I decided I was going to use I've been using that DHC deep cleansing oil that I got from sty and I have rather been enjoying it it's very similar to the hot alabo cleansing oil um similar ingredients like olive oil but it has an aroma to it to it it has I think it has Rosemary in it so you can definitely smell that but it's a pleasant cleansing oil to use one of the reasons I love using cleansing oil so much is they're just a effective at removing Cosmetics like on this particular day I'm wearing uh that Lancome adol mascara I'm also wearing their waterproof eyeliner and this really does a good job getting in there dissolving it breaking it up I can't do makeup removers I always burn my eyes sting my skin if you have rosacea we were talking about this at the beginning of the Vlog but if you have rosacea um and you're looking for a way to remove makeup try cleansing oil or cleansing balm alternatively another good option is Cold Cream like the pwns cold cream is really a good option because it dissolves the makeup but it also is like very soothing um I don't you know they call it cold cream and it does kind of feel nice and chilled going on the skin but the oil is another option or a cleansing balm the main difference between like cleansing balm and cleansing oil it's just the balm is solid at room temperature I also started using the um isant yam root vegan milk cleanser oh my gosh those of you with sensitive skin rosacea consider this mild cleanser because it's such a pleasant experience it's free of fragrance it's very hydrating it has this like slippery texture to it which may be offputting for some but I really enjoy it it almost kind of cloaks your skin in a hug as it Glides across the surface of the skin and gently cleanses without disrupting the underlying Skin Barrier you see with the double cleanse approach the first step the oil cleanser is kind of just like getting in there and breaking up residue buildup on the skin surface the second step with the mild cleanser is actually getting in there and cleansing everything away so that's why I like doing it that way typically I do the second step in the shower but I decided to do it here so you guys could see this cleanser in action and as you can see it took everything off well hey guys I am all clean moisturized hydrated got my tread noan on but um one of the things I was thinking about you know on Sundays I do a Q&A over on my Instagram and I also post it to Facebook or basically I just you know post a still image of myself and I say hey drop any skincare related questions in the comments of this Instagram post or this Facebook post and I will usually answer you know a handful of them as many as I can and I post the question and the response to my Instagram stories and it's saved in a highlight bubble if you go to my Instagram profile anyway one of the questions I got today was like how do you deal with dry eyelids especially if you live in a cold dry climate and I got to tell you petroleum jelly is a game Cher for dry eyelids or eyelid eczema because it prevents water loss really well and it also um prevents penetration of irritance into the skin so it really is a is a great option plus it's free of common allergens and irritant I mean it's basically your immune system really doesn't care about Vaseline so that's a good thing it's just like an inert little barrier support there it's really underrated for all the things you can do it's also beneficial for cutting down on chafing wind bur if you live somewhere cold and windy um what a day y'all today was gorgeous like so nice when the weather is beautiful because you just want to be outside and so soaking it all in and such a mood boost I'm telling you summertime here can get a little like you know winter months get in other places because it's really just too hot to safely be outside for long stretches of time so you kind of get a little you know the a bit of the Blues in the summertime but that being said I really love summer and I find that you know I'm happy as can be throughout the summer cuz I like all of the summer festivities like the summer holidays and summer food summer fruits I really like summer and I love the beach so I don't know winter here I I don't mind because it's pretty mild but winter is not not where it's at for in my mind like no thanks uh I'm not I'm not Team Winter I do like winter when I don't have to go anywhere then it's fine you know it's like all cozy with a fireplace and my coffee and it's relaxing sure winter time sounds Divine but the realities of existing places that have strong you know intense Winters no thank you I don't want to be out there shoving now no thanks defrosting uh the windshield I hate doing that uh I hate driving in icy conditions cuz it's not fun although I got really good at driving in snow when I lived in Colorado like I had this little trick sometimes I get stuck in the snow like in a parking space like you'd park somewhere and then maybe you'd be parked there for a while and then we get a huge dumping of snow and you kind of have to dig your car out the car I had at the time I remember I would get in it and you know you kind of like try and dig some of the snow out as best you could heat up the car so it was somewhat def you know defrosted and then I remember I would like move it forward and back and forward and back and then I would like myself I would I could rock my own car and I could get it to rock out of the out of the space and float away I got good at that you know there's certain things that are really intimidating but once you learn how to do them and you just become comfortable and it becomes a necessity that you do it and do it efficiently then it's like not a big deal anymore like parallel parking is one of those things where you just put yourself in that situation and get uncomfortable a handful of times eventually it will just be like no big deal um that's that's a lot of things like if there's anything that you are intimidated about doing or you're like apprehensive you just kind of have to throw yourself in that situation and I mean provided it's not like hazardous to your health or something you know what I mean like within reason just throw yourself in that situation and be uncomfortable for a couple of times and eventually it just be such a non-issue that you'll start doing it all the time and you'll look back and be like why was I ever freaked out about doing this it's like non B deal all right y'all I am going to wrap this Vlog up I've had a great day I hope you have had a great day thank you so much for watching to the end if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can check it out also if you want to Deep dive on information about any of these skin conditions you can actually search Cassandra Banks and rosacea or Cassandra bankson sunburn or Cassandra bankson skin condition in the YouTube search bar and we've probably done a video on it specifically if you search Cassandra bankson how to treat a sunburn I've shared with you some of my best tips and tricks as well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this next video love you guys hey",

        "transcript": "good morning my little nerds I am Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to my YouTube channel where we are going to go in deep today on the science of vitamin C I have not done this topic in over two years and I wanted to revisit it so we're gonna hit on the different types of vitamin C's and which one best applies to your skin type but before I jump in make sure to subscribe and follow and like this video and if you have not signed up yet to my newsletter make sure to log on to pillowtalkderm.com and sign up for my newsletter so you can be the first in the know whenever there's a new product release or any sort of educational material coming your way so without further Ado let us jump into Vitamin C it's one of the best ingredients that we have on the market that can really be used by everyone and anyone as long as you have skin as long as you've been exposed to the Sun as long as you live in a city you will get some benefit from vitamin C what are the main benefits of vitamin C number one it is a potent antioxidant and that means it helps to provide protection against what's known as free radical damage free radical damage happens when you are living when you're just around all right from oxygen over time from the Sun from pollution from stress outside and inside and vitamin C helps to break that [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and protect your skin in the process so that your collagen doesn't break up prematurely your elastin doesn't get weaker you don't develop discoloration at an earlier age so anybody who is human can benefit it from that perspective number two it is not an SPF replacer and I talk about it in my perfect ingredient pairing videos below but it is a beautiful ingredient to pair under your sunscreen because it boosts the effects of your sunscreen how it actually increases the amount of time your skin needs Under the Sun to turn red it is not going to reflect the UV it is not going to absorb the UV the way a sunscreen works but it helps to neutralize the effects of UVA and UVB much more efficiently number three a vitamin C is also necessary if you're looking to build collagen and I don't know about you but pretty much everyone I meet in my practice is looking to build collagen and vitamin C is key if you're trying to do that because there are two enzymes in the collagen production pathway there is parallel hydroxylase and Lysol hydroxylase that need Vitamin C in order to spit out collagen so it's the fertilizer to those enzymes to create collagen and number four and this is probably the one that holds nearest endures to my heart given that I am all about an even skin tone it helps to even out discoloration by eating up copper in your skin and you're going to ask me wait I thought we need copper copper is required in your skin and it is a key element needed for melanin production but if you have a predisposition to being hyperpigmented or in General Life the sun sun damage like we talked about oxidation you want to use up that copper so it's not readily available so you cannot over produce pigmentation and vitamin see eats up that copper so that your melanocytes don't have access to them as readily and you're not going to over produce pigment so that is how it works for pigmentation be back to who can benefit from vitamin C everyone and anyone unless you're living in a dark cave unless you have not seen the sun in a bajillion years and unless you are living in the mountains of Bhutan which you may or may not be where there's less pollution chances are you're living somewhere where there is pollution somewhere where there is sun exposure somewhere where there is stress and your skin can benefit from which vitamin C do you actually need to use there are two forms of vitamin C vitamin C is an umbrella term all right you're going to have the active form L ascorbic acid and notice the ascorb all right that is a key part of the word that you need to notice versus the inactive forms of vitamin C which all contain the word ascorb as well so if you bought a product that says vitamin C on it but you're not sure you don't see l-ascorbic acid look for sorb and you'll be able to tell whether or not that product contains a type of vitamin C it is slightly misleading when a product or a brand says we have a vitamin C whatever but they're not using the active form because the active form is the one that directly goes to work when it's applied on your skin the inactive forms have to get converted in your skin to go to work and then you might ask me wait so why don't I just use the active form I'm a step ahead the active form is not for everyone let's jump in the active form of vitamin C is also known as L ascorbic acid it is the one that has been the most tried and true the most studied but that one is a little beach of an ingredient because she isn't stable she's hella irritating and it's not for everyone and a lot of Brands higher is better in terms of concentration and percentages but it is not it has been studied to show an effect anywhere from three to five percent that your skin can benefit from higher doesn't necessarily mean better after 20 it's almost overload your skin is no longer getting any benefits from it except for potential irritations so this is one that you really do have to approach cautiously and with a grain of salt because it's not necessarily for everyone its instability is also another issue I don't know if you've noticed but a lot of times when you buy vitamin C it's light in color and it then turns darker over time that is because of oxidation and once it turns darker over time it's not as useful to your skin and all you're doing is applying an acidic product but we'll get into that in a second on your skin that can be irritating so you really have to use it up when you first buy it another thing that really bothers me about vitamin C and ascorbic acid and a lot of the brands including the ones I'm going to mention sell them in a dropper okay it's opaque it's slightly darker even though this one is darker and translucent but it comes in a dropper that is going to be exposed day in and day out as you can see this is a very old one it's extremely dark usually the color is extremely light pale yellow as if you had very hydrated pee I've had this one in my closet for a while so I would not use this one but that simple Act of opening and closing is going to cause more oxidation and more breakdown of your active form of vitamin C the CM niad has a pump top that I cut and I put on top of this normally if I am going to use this form of vitamin C and it keeps it sealed off from oxygen longer than it would if every day you're opening and closing it but number two it also stains yes it stains because fun facts when it breaks down as this one has right it turns into a chemical also known as erythrallos which is in self-tanners so that is why AI you're gonna have a stain when you use this on your skin let's just show you guys for shits and giggles because why not if I put this on my skin which I am pale AF it does give your skin a little bit of an orange Hue to it so yeah it can stain your skin at number three the pH of it it needs to be formulated at a pH of 3.5 or below and that is very acidic and it needs to be formulated at this pH in order to get absorbed in your skin and not many people can tolerate that so who is elliscorbic acid good for most skin types can use it around 10 percent up to 15 but you have to be careful at around 20 because it can be very irritating oily acne prone skin I honestly do not recommend it because it can be irritating and further worsen inflammation which you probably already have if you have acne prone skin and if you are sensitive just avoid l-ascorbic acid and save yourself a lot of headaches down the road because you probably are going to get some form of irritation on your face my top picks though four products with l-ascorbic acid even though this one has obviously oxidized this is one that has been studied for years it has a lot of Science and Merit behind it it's SkinCeuticals it's expensive as hell it's 182 bucks for just this bottle that has clearly gone to waste but it's 15 ascorbic acid with vitamin E and ferulic acid at one percent and 0.5 percent to help stabilize it because it's not a stable ingredient the vitamin E also helps the photo protection of vitamin C the ferulic acid also doubles that photo protection it is a magic combination as a trio but it comes in a dropper which is a waste for such an expensive product Paula's Choice however is at 55 it's also a 15 percent ascorbic acid with vitamin E and ferulic acid but they do not specify the percentages of that it still comes in a dropper but I want to show you guys this one is a relatively new one this is the original color of vitamin C hydrated urine okay it is not dehydrated piss like the other one which has been opened several times as opposed to oxygen now you nerves all have been shouting in the comment section that you love this Timeless brand this they have two types okay of L ascorbic acid a 10 and a 20 and they retail for 26 dollars each which is interesting that for one ounce they sell at the same price at bigger sizes I think the price changes and I don't quite understand how they managed to do that because the raw materials are more expensive unless they're just losing on their margins it's also combined with vitamin E as well as prolic acid they do not specify the percentages and they have hyaluronic acid if you're going to have hyaluronic acid in your skincare routine try to limit it to one step of your routine you do not need to have a dedicated ha serum you do not need to have it in all of your products at all at all at all this one contains it so just keep it in mind if you're sensitive and you're trying dying to try an l-ascorbic acid it's within your price range started the 10 percent do not start at the 20. the pros they did it right it comes in a pump at least it's clear it's protected it's opaque they're not trying to sell you on you acting like a chemist so I like the fact that they come in pumps they're lightweight and they all stink by the way they all smell like hot dogs every single one of these CeraVe has their skin renewing vitamin C serum which is 27 it's 10 ascorbic acid with panthenol ceramides and H A because of SEO every brand wants to have H A it is a white milky sort of serum it still has a smell and I got some on my nose good thing for me is I have kleenex today so this is survey's vitamin C serum that you guys all love so now let us transition to the inactive forms of vitamin C because L ascorbic acid is not for everything the inactive forms of vitamin C offer different levels of benefits from stability from irritability from what it can do for your skin and even your type of skin so let us start with sodium ascorbal phosphate I am going to refer to this as sap to make my life simple what is sap sodium phosphate is the ascorbic acids monophosphate Ester and it is great in terms of stability because it can be formulated at a pH of seven so it's not going to be irritating on your skin the penetration compared to the pure form is questionable it is more it's not as well absorbed as ascorbic acid and the conversion rate into a square acid there's no real hard data for this so how does it compare in terms of antioxidant quality it has photoprotective and antioxidant protective properties when studied in Vivo in vitro it has helped slightly with collagen production and it does help fade brown spots as well in Vivo a unique benefit though to this one because you might be asking me why should I use this one if it's all kind of questionable is that if you have oily or acne prone skin this is the type of vitamin C Ester you want to look at sap is the one for you because one to five percent has been shown to suppress the bacteria on our skin that leads to acne formation and if you are super oily or super prone to inflammation you might want to look at a vitamin C Ester that helps to minimize that bacteria on your skin so it's great for oily prone skin acne prone skin especially if you have a predisposition to breakouts and also if you are looking for a collagen boosting effect it is not necessarily what sap excels at but it has been shown in vitro to Aid in collagen production so you beauty is one by Tina this resurfacing compound right here it is a hundred and forty eight dollars they also combine it with glycolic and mandelic acid personally I do not love exfoliating with glycolic acid in the morning because it can make you more sun sensitive so I would use this at night in your routine so I would use this type of vitamin C at night if you're going to use the U Beauty it also has h a it is a very watery serum as you can tell right here but it's protected from the sun and it comes in a pump you guys also liked mad hippie mad hippie is a vitamin C serum that retails for 33 dollars I hate The Dropper but it is a much more stable product compared to ascorbic acid so if any type of vitamin C is going to come in a dropper let it be a vitamin C it's also combined with vitamin E ferulic acid and hyaluronic acid but it's 33 dollars the texture of it by the way I just opened it and it showed you guys is a little slimy do I love the texture I do not love this texture but it goes away pretty fast it leaves a slight tacky residue and it has more of a floral scent I think they tried to mask the scent slightly with this one and so the third one I don't have it here is number seven protect and perfect intense Advanced serum for 29 this one is a very good drugstore option for sap especially if you are somebody who's acne prone skin you can use it in the morning it's not combined with an exfoliating acid and it has matrixyl 3000 which is a collagen boosting peptide so if you are someone who is oily looking for collagen benefits but can't handle ascorbic acid this one is for you you're gonna get it through the peptide of matrixyl 3000 and you're gonna get the benefits at least of the vitamin C in terms of an antioxidant without being irritable on your skin next up magnesium is carbal phosphate map is a sturified form of vitamin C it has great stability but that's pretty much where it ends because it gets poorly absorbed in your skin and although it does convert to AAA in vitro the antioxidant properties are questionable in vitro it does produce collagen and there is some evidence to suggests pigmentary benefits but other than that not much and there are better ingredients on the market that you can combine with to get some pigmentary benefits if that is all you're really going to get from this product and the sake and the spirit of being well-rounded glossier their super glow vitamin C is one that contains map as well as magnesium and it's one that you can incorporate into your routine if you're dying to have a vitamin C for the hell of it sure why not but it's probably the most useless form of vitamin C moving on to my favorite Ester form of vitamin C is tetrahexal desolate ascorbate also known as THD it is lipid soluble it is my personal favorite it is stable at a pH of around five and it has great absorption even better than ascorbic acid believe it or not because it is oil soluble so your skin is going to suck it in and it's going to even surpass the penetration of the pure form of vitamin C and it converts to ascorbic acid in vitro how does it compare it has antioxidant properties it has proven collagen benefits as well and it helps with pigmentation discoloration in vitro with skin brightening Effects by reducing melanogenesis by more than 80 percent in human cell cultures so who is it good for all skin types but especially if you're looking to brighten your skin and especially if you are looking to even out your skin skin tone and if you have sensitive skin this is the one for you my top picks Shameless plugged pillow talk through my active seal I love this guy I obviously created it I know what's in it I use it twice a day because you need more of an ester form of vitamin C to get the full-on benefits so I use it in the morning and I use it at night and it also has ceramides in it to help lock in moisture as well as peptides to help with collagen boosting effects of this type of form of vitamin C it comes in a pump not not exposed to air and once you're done and I don't want to open it because I haven't opened this one yet you can twist the cap up and scrape off anything left behind so this is my own personal favorite obviously I made it so I'm going to be biased retails for 58 bucks Dr Loretta has a serum in a 70 dropper with glycolipids as well to trap in moisture this has THD inside as you can see it's a creamy serum and it smells slightly citrusy and then Sunday Riley has their CEO vitamin C brightening Serum at 85 dollars with squalane to help replenish your Skin Barrier and this one is also oops uh very liquidy syrup just spit out so those are thd's moving on next two forms of vitamin C i liken a product that combines them because if you are somebody who is sensitive but looking to get some sort of collagen effect and a little bit of a brightening effect and a very lightweight serum this is your product I'm starting backwards summer Fridays combines the form known as ascorbal glucoside as well as the 3-0 ethyl ascorbate form the reason why this is important is because ascorval leukocyte is only water soluble so although it offers the same benefits as Vitamin C in terms of antioxidant production and collagen production and pigmentation the absorption is not great and I would say this form of vitamin C is one you would use in order to get more of that collagen boosting effect the three EAC form of vitamin C is water and lipid soluble so if you're looking for more of a brightening effect this one is probably going to help you out more but I like it in combination with ascorbable glucoside so you can get somewhat of the collagen production as well it comes in a serum so it's not 100 hydrating but it's a nice one to use underneath a moisturizer or if you do not feel like you need a moisturizer it can probably do its thing on its own this particular serum retails for 68 dollars and there is niacinamide in here as well moving on corvo palmitate this is similar to ascorbic acid but in terms of stability so there aren't many improvements there it can penetrate like ascorbic acid and the conversion is questionable at best with antioxidant wise it hasn't been proven to be great collagen wise maybe pigmentation wise there's not much data so pretty much it's kind of useless I wouldn't necessarily look for a scorable palmitate in any sort of product I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it and last we have immunopropyl ascorbal phosphate also known as AAP this is the newest and latest coming out of Korea in terms of stability it has been shown to be very stable it is utilizing the pure form of vitamin C married to a molecule known as 3appa but in terms of penetration and conversion there is still a lot to be determined here and we do not know enough to know how well that works according to the manufacturer it decreases hyperpigmentation significantly after eight weeks and it helps with wrinkle reductions dramatically after eight weeks by reducing wrinkles around 23 again more is needed more studies are needed more science is needed but if you have a lot of money and you're willing to knock yourself out and you want to spend 275 dollars neocutis has a bio serum firm that contains this form of vitamin C in addition to glycerin and certain growth factors are you spending your money on the vitamin C I do not know again I do not know enough to recommend this product but let me know in the comment section if you've tried it and if you like it so with that we have done a full discussion on vitamin C's their derivatives and which one best suits your skin type and what not to use if you are sensitive or irritable or just plain old cranky I don't know if I have the answer for you there I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope you guys have a beautiful Saturday let me know in the comment section below what you guys

        "transcript": "hi I'm Dr anchal pant dermatologist today\u00a0\nI'll tell you everything about sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin so what is sensitive skin if your skin gets\u00a0\nred very easily it starts burning itching gets\u00a0\u00a0 dry irritated you have a burning or a stinging\u00a0\nsensation that means that you have sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin when you have sensitive skin you have to rule\u00a0\nout rosacea rosacea is a condition in which your\u00a0\u00a0 skin becomes red and the skin starts burning\u00a0\nbecoming itchy and you have a stinging or a\u00a0\u00a0 burning sensation on exposure to sunlight or even\u00a0\non consumption of hot beverages so if you don't\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea how can we tackle sensitive skin\u00a0\nsensitive skin is of three types dry sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 oily sensitive or combination sensitive so\u00a0\nwhat should you do if you have sensitive skin\u00a0\u00a0 keep your skin care to the minimum okay just use\u00a0\ntwo-step routine that is it that is very important\u00a0\u00a0 do not try new products on your skin without\u00a0\nunderstanding the ingredients in the products\u00a0\u00a0 use very minimal makeup light makeup whenever\u00a0\nyou have sensitive skin and concentrate on using\u00a0\u00a0 a good moisturizer a good moisturizer that suits\u00a0\nyour skin type that repairs the Skin Barrier will\u00a0\u00a0 take you a long way when you have sensitive skin\u00a0\nso these are the four things that should really\u00a0\u00a0 concentrate on if you have sensitive skin so\u00a0\nuse minimum number of products there are so many\u00a0\u00a0 products in the market and you feel you know like\u00a0\nyou'd require everything that's out there you want\u00a0\u00a0 to try everything that's out there but please\u00a0\ndon't feel this fear of missing out especially\u00a0\u00a0 when you have sensitive skin you are just exposing\u00a0\nyour skin to more allergens more irritants and you\u00a0\u00a0 don't want that also a two-step routine is enough\u00a0\nto take good care of your skin so let's say in\u00a0\u00a0 the morning you wash your face apply a serum\u00a0\nor a moisturizer and a sunscreen and at night\u00a0\u00a0 a serum and a moisturizer that is enough that is\u00a0\nenough to take care of your skin you don't need\u00a0\u00a0 complicated 10-step routines to keep your skin\u00a0\nhealthy so just stick to the basics use minimal\u00a0\u00a0 makeup as this will take you a long way try to\u00a0\navoid very thick High coverage Foundation I know\u00a0\u00a0 this can be tricky because you want to hide your\u00a0\nredness but especially when you're going through\u00a0\u00a0 a phase when your skin looks very irritated\u00a0\nI would suggest using a calming moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 or soothing gel which I'll be mentioning later in\u00a0\nthe video those will help in soothing the redness\u00a0\u00a0 then trying to just layer makeup on top okay this\u00a0\ncan dry skin out and irritate your skin further\u00a0\u00a0 so you can use something very lightweight like\u00a0\na tinted moisturizer or a tinted sunscreen so\u00a0\u00a0 you can use a moisturizer first and then go on\u00a0\ntop of the tinted sunscreen this can give you\u00a0\u00a0 minimal coverage okay so don't go for very high\u00a0\ncoverage Foundation when you have sensitive skin\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer is your best friend when you have\u00a0\nsensitive skin a moisturizer with soothing\u00a0\u00a0 ingredients will help in repairing Skin Barrier\u00a0\nreducing trans epidermal water loss also reducing\u00a0\u00a0 redness irritation itching that you might be\u00a0\nfacing four things you should not do if you\u00a0\u00a0 have sensitive skin type using every product out\u00a0\nthere in the market you don't need it using a very\u00a0\u00a0 complicated skin care routine you don't need that\u00a0\nstick to just a two-step routine scrubs and peels\u00a0\u00a0 stay away from any kind of physical scrubs\u00a0\neven exfoliants physical chemical exfoliants\u00a0\u00a0 or you know any kind of harsh face washes or\u00a0\neven home-based peels please stay away from\u00a0\u00a0 them if you have sensitive skin okay you might be\u00a0\nirritating your skin further you don't want to do\u00a0\u00a0 that because sensitive skin has to be cared\u00a0\nfor with a lot of care and attention so even\u00a0\u00a0 if you want to go for a peel you want to visit\u00a0\na dermatologist and get that done in a correct\u00a0\u00a0 way and no home remedies please you have to stay\u00a0\naway from ingredients that can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 such as gram flour lemon or any kind of citrus\u00a0\nfruits I would like you to stay away from that\u00a0\u00a0 if you want to go for home remedies you can apply\u00a0\na little bit of papaya some watermelon cucumber\u00a0\u00a0 banana these are okay even curd can sometimes\u00a0\ncause irritation and you know honey can sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 cause a lot of redness so I would say stay\u00a0\naway from all this if you have sensitive skin\u00a0\u00a0 so how to choose products for sensitive skin\u00a0\nso there are certain ingredients that work well\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin such as ceramides bisobolol\u00a0\npantothenol Central isiatica these work well if\u00a0\u00a0 you have sensitive skin you want to use products\u00a0\nthat are fragrance free and paraben free I'm not\u00a0\u00a0 saying that Euro paraben is bad in your product if\u00a0\nyou are using some creams with paraben in it you\u00a0\u00a0 should dispose it discard it absolutely not you\u00a0\ncan continue to use products with paraben not a\u00a0\u00a0 problem but if you are somebody who reacts easily\u00a0\nto products then you can stay away from paraben\u00a0\u00a0 because that can lead to some allergies now I\u00a0\nhave a few product recommendations for you for\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin type these are usually the products\u00a0\nthat I recommend my patients if you are already\u00a0\u00a0 using some products that are suiting you you can\u00a0\ncontinue that not a problem no need to switch\u00a0\u00a0 but if you are somebody with sensitive skin type\u00a0\nnot knowing what to use what would suit you and\u00a0\u00a0 if you're on the fence whether to buy a product\u00a0\nor not then this guide will help you out so for\u00a0\u00a0 dry sensitive skin my recommendations are for a\u00a0\nface wash you can use Epi soft Cetaphil ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 squalene cleanser moisturizer you can use when you\u00a0\nshare Dome sugandha ceramide and wood moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 or Cetaphil Dam sunscreen go for a plain zinc\u00a0\noxide sunscreen such as last year physical bio UV\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen tinted sunscreen by Doma Co the dermaco\u00a0\npure zinc sunscreen for night cream you can use\u00a0\u00a0 a ceramide base cream and a retinol twice in a\u00a0\nweek so if you have sensitive skin you can still\u00a0\u00a0 go ahead and use the retinol but use it only once\u00a0\nor twice in a week see how you tolerate and then\u00a0\u00a0 you can increase it as per the tolerance of your\u00a0\nskin don't you know jump into retinol every night\u00a0\u00a0 you can use it just once or twice in a week and\u00a0\nsee always use a good thick moisturizer over your\u00a0\u00a0 retinol and use a ceramide based moisturizer that\u00a0\ncan work you can use avine thermal water Mist it\u00a0\u00a0 is a little expensive but it pays worth it if you\u00a0\nhave sensitive skin that gets irritated easily if\u00a0\u00a0 you are on the go you know if you're Outdoors\u00a0\na lot then just spraying a little bit of this\u00a0\u00a0 misk and really help in calming and soothing the\u00a0\nskin down this works very well along with that\u00a0\u00a0 even rose water Mist by first Essentials works\u00a0\nreally well to soothe and calm your skin down\u00a0\u00a0 now my recommendations for oily sensitive\u00a0\nskin or combination sensitive skin so face\u00a0\u00a0 wash cetaphilosi biodoma Sensi bioface wash for\u00a0\nmoisturizer you can either use excela or Riza or V\u00a0\u00a0 green moisturizer for a sunscreen you can use any\u00a0\nPlains and oxide sunscreen or lash yield physical\u00a0\u00a0 or a bio UV will work well for a night cream you\u00a0\ncan use thika calming skin renewing night gel I\u00a0\u00a0 really like to recommend a central asiatica based\u00a0\ncream at night for people with oily or combination\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin that helps in soothing the skin\u00a0\nout and really repairs Your Skin Barrier so this\u00a0\u00a0 works well so any Serum with Central asiatica\u00a0\nor even niacinamide will work well for you\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin is a bit tricky to manage because\u00a0\nof the inherent nature of the skin we cannot try\u00a0\u00a0 too many products out and also we don't know what\u00a0\nwill suit or well not it might take a little time\u00a0\u00a0 for you to know what products work best for you\u00a0\nand then you can stick to it I hope you found this\u00a0\u00a0 video useful and found it informative if you like\u00a0\nthe skin and hair related content you can

        "transcript": "i'm a dermatologist and what i'm about to tell you regarding the skin care industry is probably going to shock you 99 of the skin care world is absolute in this video i'm going to explain to you why there's almost no products that have convincing evidence that they work how all of these skin care brands are basically competing on marketing and not actually how effective they are and why this will probably be the last ever video i do about skincare my name is osama and i'm a dermatologist living and working in new york but i want to be so much more than that by making videos on this channel focusing on how to live a better more meaningful life but before i focus my entire channel on that i need to go out with a bang with my last ever video about skincare so here goes nothing i said that 99 of the skincare world is nonsense so i want to start my video focusing on that one percent that we actually do know and it might surprise you to hear this but there's really not that much i demonstrated this recently with a tweet thread which i will link in the description down below but i'm gonna go one step further in this video and put all of that information into one infographic that is here on the screen this what you see in front of you right here is the entire foundation for the absolute hellscape that is skincare content creation the skin care industry and the rabid social media obsession that it has generated with billions of views on skincare contents on a weekly basis is basically the information on this infographic repackaged the brand names of the products the bottles in which they come the specific content creator and the types of dances they do those things might change but the underlying information is basically what you're seeing on the screen here try it for yourself next time you come across a skincare video refer back to this infographic and see whether or not the information was already on here so how was i able to crystallize all of this information so easily well it's because i am the best skincare content creator and that's why you should only subscribe to me i'm also working on a few new dances that are gonna knock your socks off okay not quite the real reason is because there's really not that much skin care that is evidence-based trust me i have studied the skin at a cellular level it is literally my job to know how to improve the skin so if there was some kind of ingredient out there that had a huge impact there's no way it's going to be kept a secret from me and if you're sitting there thinking what about that at home face mask that i learned from tiktok where i blend seven essential oils together i don't see that on your infographic well yes that's because that doesn't actually have scientific evidence supporting it unfortunately online likes and view counts on tick tocks are not a credible replacement for scientific research and if they were then this person here would probably be the head of the world health organization and between me and you he'd probably do a better job so then how do i know which product to buy do you want to know the honest truth i don't know and any skincare influencer that tells you that they do know which over-the-counter product has the best scientific evidence is lying to you and most likely has a financial incentive for giving you that answer here is all we can do we can look at the ingredients of an over-the-counter product cross-reference it with that infographic i showed you earlier and tell you that yes it contains the active ingredient which has been shown to help problems like yours but the other reason that gets complicated is salicylic acid or hyaluronic acid or retinol even if the ingredient label says the exact same word those are not actually the same across multiple different products we don't know how much exact quantity of that ingredient is in the product we don't know the quality of the ingredient or the stability of its formulation and we also don't know how well it's been constructed to actually penetrate through the skin barrier which is a huge challenge so i actually can't tell you that even some of my favorite skincare brands have amazing evidence that they work here's what i would need in order to tell you confidently that an over-the-counter skincare product has evidence of efficacy i would need a large group of volunteers around 50-100 i would then enroll them into a split-faced double-blinded placebo-controlled trial what that means is for each volunteer i would need a trained study supervisor to split their face in half just using a marker pen or something not actually split their face in half and to then apply the product that we're testing to one half of the face and to the other half they would need to apply a cream that looked felt smelled exactly the same as the product we're testing except without the key active ingredients neither the study supervisor or the volunteer would be allowed to know which is the real product and which is the control i would then need these study participants to come back on a weekly basis for around four to six weeks and we would take standardized photos using the same position the same lighting the same facial expressions we would then give these standardized photos to a trained scorer who would rate them on things like clarity evenness texture vibrancy whatever you're testing for ideally you'd actually have two scorers for any one set of photos and if there was a discrepancy between their score you would then get a third person to come in and give the deciding score and then finally at the end of the trial whether it's six weeks or eight weeks you would then pull all of that data together and do some statistical analysis to see whether or not there was a significant difference between the product you're testing and the blank control but nobody has that level of data for over-the-counter products even the evidence-based skin care brands that your favorite dermatologists recommend don't have them let alone these random boutique natural rejuvenating creams that don't even have safety data let alone efficacy data so then why do we recommend certain products basically it's a combination of three things reputation personal familiarity and positive feedback loops so reputation first and foremost i tend to recommend products from big reputable companies because i know that at the very least they have done safety data to make sure that these creams are not going to cause allergic responses in the majority of people who use them that is way more than can be said for these random boutique etsy creams where each week i have patients in my clinic coming in with full body rashes because they've used them next personal familiarity and this is where it gets a little bit murky these skincare companies cerave cetaphil avino neutrogena they know that i'm a dermatologist and that i was a dermatology resident a few years ago and so they've been sending me free skin care samples for years and even if they don't send me skincare samples directly they have made sure that all of the clinics in which i train have a bunch of free patient samples to hand out to them now naturally when i have a whole wall of those samples i'm gonna take some of those and try them myself at home once i've personally used one of those products it is just human nature that i'm much more likely to recommend them as compared to another product when a patient asks me so yes that is why i am so likely to recommend cerave moisturizing lotion because i use it myself that doesn't actually mean that cerave moisturizing lotion has some incredible evidence showing it is the best moisturizer out there on the market what it does mean is that that company's marketing department is really smart and it's made sure that its products are in the hands of dermatology residents and dermatologists once these products become the favorites of dermatologists the rest of the population follow suit because they assume we have some extra special information showing that they're the best and all of this leads to part three which is positive patient feedback once i've given out these samples and recommended it to a lot of patients naturally when they follow up with me a few weeks or months later and they tell me hey i love that new moisturizer or cleanser that checks the box in my head and makes me much more likely to hand out that same product again in future now all of those three are totally reasonable reasons why i recommend certain products over others but i just want to emphasize to you that it's not because i know they have the best efficacy so then why is there so much skin care content out there if there is so little that we actually know this is where it's time to get super real and i might even get closer to the camera that's too close skincare has absolutely exploded in recent years and it's not because we suddenly have innovative new ingredients that give better effects it's actually because our society has become incredibly superficial with the rise of social media and our skin is literally the outermost part of ourselves which interfaces with this world now don't get me wrong i think it is always important to take skin health seriously there's just no denying that non-stop photos and videos with all these filters have made people think that perfect skin is the baseline it has given us all a collective body dysmorphia for our skin and made us think that even the smallest blemishes are somehow problems so that has sparked this quest for perfect skin and with that hunger for skin care content has come a huge market opportunity for skin care content creators there's almost no social media content for which there is more appetite and which will help your channel grow faster than doing skin care and trust me i have seen this first hand so far i've put in fairly minimal effort into this youtube channel and i somehow have 10 000 subscribers already whereas some people with incredible content about philosophy life and history would have been making videos for years and years and would end up with 300 subscribers the chances are most of you watching this video came here because you saw me on early abdul's channel talking about skin care and all of this comes with a huge financial upside too even at my scale with a fairly small youtube and instagram channel i already get emails on a weekly basis from skincare companies a lot of these companies offer three four five thousand dollars for just a one minute review thankfully i'm in a stable enough financial situation that i don't have to accept these offers but honestly i see the appeal but then put yourself in the shoes of these content creators who have just started a youtube tick tock or instagram as they're starting to grow a following they can't just keep putting up that one infographic i showed you earlier and tell people hey i've said all i need to say just keep referencing that one video there's a pressure to keep churning out videos on a daily basis and so they have to repackage that content in new and interesting ways and one way of doing that is by reviewing 25 different benzoyl peroxide cleansers and acting like you're doing a really nuanced scientific review when in reality you're just doing a snapshot judgment for entertainment value and it's really not that scientific at all all of this has now led to a generation of people that have become skin care enthusiasts almost as a personality type and honestly if people want to watch skin care content as a type of entertainment or hobby i totally understand that i waste hours on a daily basis watching youtube videos about manchester united transfer news or call of duty so if it's for entertainment value do your thing i have no judgments on how you spend your time but my issue is that i think these people think they're getting medical grade or scientific advice when they are really not so here's the conclusion the dirty little secret of the skin care world now that you have the information from that infographic the next time you have an issue with your skin find an over-the-counter product which has one of the right ingredients for your problem make sure it's the right price point and my recommendation is no more than thirty dollars for a product and then just work your way through a few products trying them out for at least six to eight weeks because that's how long you need to try them to see if they work and once you've found one that works for you just stick to that and if there's no over-the-counter product that seems to be working go to see your dermatologist because we can give you a prescription strength solution that actually does have the scientific evidence base showing it works and beyond that you really shouldn't care what any of these skin care content creators say because their incentives are to keep you watching keep their channels growing and to keep those sweet sweet brand deals coming in and on that note this video was brought to you by and it wasn't it wasn't brought to you by um any skincare company that would have been a really bad idea and in actual fact i probably made sure i will never get a skincare brand deal ever again after this video now listen if you enjoyed this no-nonsense style of content i'm bringing the same scientific mindset the same authenticity to my future videos that are going to be focusing on how to live a better more meaningful life we're going to be talking about things like mindfulness religion how to build deeper more lasting relationships so i encourage you to stick around and see if you enjoy them but as for skin care i have said all i need to say",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video i'm going to be talking all about why it is that niacinamide causes redness irritation stinging burning for so many people if you're new here welcome my name is andrea i'm a board certified dermatologist and i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and if you like this content give this video a thumbs up it really helps my channel out a lot niacinamide is everywhere in skincare creams serums toners essences sprays lotions potions masks can we get a niacinamide tank that we just dunk our heads in seriously why is it in so many things well it's an antioxidant and it's actually been shown to benefit the skin in so many ways it can help fight off free radicals it actually has been shown to help your skin deal with ultraviolet radiation a little bit better it helps your skin barrier repair itself so that your skin stays hydrated and healthy and resists irritation better and it also helps reduce oiliness and it helps reduce pore size and it helps minimize redness and it can help with hyperpigmentation so why in the heck with something with so many scientific backed benefits cause discomfort redness stinging and irritation for people i mean it's supposed to be an anti-inflammatory ingredient that helps redness so why does it cause redness for some people the short answer is we really don't know but there are a few possibilities as to why you may experience these different symptoms the first possibility is that you are allergic to topical niacinamide this is actually very unlikely and we don't see this very often so it's unlikely that you're actually allergic to it keep in mind with most skin allergies meaning allergies to things that come in contact with the skin it requires you to have been exposed to that ingredient or substance in the past and then you become sensitized to it so it would be very unusual for you to have a problem with niacinamide using it for the first time it's very rare and for the most part allergic contact dermatitis to niacinamide is incredibly incredibly rare the second possibility i think is far more common and that is that you are actually sensitive to something else in the product whether it be a preservative or an inactive ingredient that is helpful for formulation overall that for whatever reason you are particularly sensitive to in my experience as a dermatologist many people will self-report that certain preservatives are irritating to their skin for example the preservative binoxi ethanol totally a fine ingredient it's great it keeps products safe but for some people they have identified that that ingredient causes redness and irritation so it might actually be something else and niacinamide is just guilty by association the third possibility and what i think is far more likely is that you are overdoing it niacinamide while it's beneficial for the skin you certainly can have too much of a good thing and if you scan the labels or really just the front of the label of most niacinamide products a lot of them are touting pretty high levels of niacinamide if you actually go to the literature percentages of niacinamide used in the studies that demonstrated skin benefit range anywhere from two percent upwards to five percent max but you'll find ten percent niacinamide serum fifteen percent twelve percent twenty percent uh and at higher percentages it's obvious that niacinamide is a lot more irritating and you know that's the case for many skin care ingredients you can have too much of a good thing not only that if you are using a moisturizer with niacinamide a serum with niacinamide and a face wash with niacinamide that's a lot of niacinamide and it's likely causing irritation for you so how much niacinamide is too much truthfully it probably boils down to something maybe to do with your genetics your background skin type as far as how much you actually can tolerate so i think it varies a lot from individual to individual speaking back to the studies studies using two percent niacinamide applied to the skin daily demonstrated an improvement in oiliness so if you're seeking that outcome then don't chase after serums and whatnot that are advertising higher percentages you know it really doesn't get you any better results and if anything it's just more irritating likewise many of the studies looking at improvement in hyperpigmentation and redness looked at percentages of four percent and five percent so there's absolutely no reason to go much higher than that a lot of manufacturers simply don't disclose the percentage of niacinamide in a product i find that people who want to disclose the percentage are people who put a lot of niacinamide in their product because they're trying to seduce you into buying the product perhaps making you think that higher is better but obviously it's not it can be more irritating and the studies are not looking at these higher percentages you know i'm very fond of the cerave products and they have niacinamide in them i imagine at a lower percentage but i don't know that i don't work for cerave i don't know what the percentage of sera of niacinamide in their moisturizers is but even those products which i assume the niacinamide is at a lower percentage even in those products a lot of people do report burning and stinging with their products and they attribute it perhaps to the niacinamide but i think it's really more something to do with the formulation overall that causes the burning and stinging so manufacturers don't make it super easy for us to figure this out not to mention the fact that it's going to boil down to you as an individual and what your skin can tolerate and so in my opinion there's really no need to be using these niacinamide serums and products that have niacinamide at a percentage higher than five percent let's just stick with what the studies used uh because we do know that higher percentages are more irritating so rather than putting yourself at risk for irritation just stick to what what we know works and if you do find that niacinamide in any product causes irritation it's not it's not an essential ingredient to the health of your skin yes niacinamide has benefits for the skin but it's not an essential you know there are similar ingredients that also reduce inflammation help with skin barrier repair and help with oiliness that you know you might elect to try instead green tea licorice root soy these all have similar benefits so those are the three reasons why you might have a problem with niacinamide some people self-report having sensitive skin and we don't entirely know why they have sensitive skin and by sensitive skin i mean they report symptoms of like burning stinging and irritation with things that come in contact with the skin this may be due to something in their genetics that just makes them more sensitive to things but it also is possible that your skin becomes sensitive at different periods of time in your life due to life changes changes in your background medical history or changes in your environment like for example the humidity in the winter time the ambient humidity drops your skin becomes drier it can become more sensitive to skin care products other skin care products that you're using may be exfoliating they're going to make your skin more sensitive overall um hormonal changes pregnancy birth control these things all can influence whether or not you have sensitive skin but some people you know from cradle to grave go their whole life with very sensitive hyper what's called hyper irritable skin like they just get red really easily and irritated some of these people may have a skin condition called rosacea but others you know they're just very sensitive so those are the most kind of obvious reasons why you might have sensitivity with niacinamide but let's dive a little bit deeper into a vitamin b3 niacinamide is a form of vitamin b3 but another form of vitamin b3 is niacin or nicotinic acid and niacinamide is what is obviously in skin care products but niacin if it's applied to the skin it will cause it can cause flushing and redness and irritation niacin is also something that people can take by mouth and pill form and it too can cause very profound flushing niacinamide however it's you know kissing cousin they're virtually identical with the exception of one tiny little change um niacinamide does not cause that flushing when applied topically to the skin now niacinamide and niacin they can convert back and forth niacinamide there's the possibility that it can convert to niacin so you may be wondering well is it possible that the niacinamide in my product is being converted to the niacin form that causes flushing well it seems very very very unlikely i'm not a cosmetic chemist but i will tell you this niacinamide is very very very stable and the rate of it converting over to niacinamide in a product has got to be incredibly low to non-existent there are a few things that are going to influence the extent to which that might occur things like the viscosity of the product if a product is a liquid it's going to be more likely than if it's a cream but most products that you apply to your skin they have some type of thickener in them making that very unlikely the other thing is the ph at a more acidic ph you might expect to get some conversion of niacinamide to nicotinic acid and this becomes relevant and of a concern to people who are using niacinamide with vitamin c like topical vitamin c serums now as you guys know from my videos topical vitamin c products they need to be in an acidic ph in order for the vitamin c to actually get into the skin so there is some theoretical worry that the acidic ph of the vitamin c serum could cause the niacinamide to convert to niacin and cause flushing but even that has not really it's not likely that that's happening but it is possible that it's happening at some low low low level um it's just you know i don't i can't say for sure i can't say it's not happening it seems unlikely but it you know it's something that i suppose on some low level is happening and it may be at a level that's just enough to cause problems for you the other thing to keep in mind though is the nature of a niacin induced flush is pretty specific a niacin induced flush which is basically facial redness with application of niacin it should occur diffusely to the area within the area that the niacin is applied and it's accompanied by kind of a tingling and a tingling sensation and a warmth and then goes away as opposed to an irritant contact dermatitis result that's due to maybe the acidic ph of like your vitamin c serum that's going to persist that's what i can tell you guys about niacinamide and your skin care products and why it may be causing problems for you the most likely culprit is either you're using too much or there's something else in the product that is causing issue for you it's very unlikely that you have a true allergy to it and it's unlikely that it's being converted to niacin the form that definitely causes flush but pay attention you know if if you have noticed that any product with niacinamide no matter whether or not the concentration is disclosed or not if it causes problems for you then avoid it and there are other ingredients that yield similar benefits uh soy and licorice root green tea these can all help oiliness skin barrier function hyperpigmentation redness so if you're having issue with niacinamide you know stop spinning your wheels and just abandon it it's not an essential i hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe i'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

        "transcript": "what's up everyone we're back dr maxfield dr shah and welcome back to our channel dr lee think about hitting the subscribe button right now and turn on your notifications if you want to see when our new videos go live dr maxfield is trying to outgrow my beard today he's get bored with life i just needed to change so today we're gonna play a little bit of a game it's called overrated or underrated so we're gonna yell out some ingredients and then we're gonna decide whether or not we think they're overrated or underrated over under ingredients edition here we go here we go the first ingredient we're going to talk about is hyaluronic acid or h.a what's your impression of this overrated yeah yeah i agree i agree overrated overrated so you guys can go back and watch our vichy mineral 89 video we love the product as a matter of fact every time before we shoot videos i put on hyaluronic acid that's actually a must for me because it gives you that really healthy looking glow especially if you're shooting video but is it a necessary part of a skincare routine absolutely not yeah so not only is it not a necessary part of a skincare routine it's in everything so there's there's hyaluronic acid serums there's hyaluronic acid in actives a lot of times there's hyaluronic acid sometimes in your retinoid sometimes there's hyaluronic acid in your moisturizer so it's literally everywhere it's found its way into every single product and every single skincare brand will highlight it like hyaluronic acid and we don't know whether it's low weight high weight we don't know anything about their hyaluronic acid so what i think is that it's been promised to be like the cure-all for all things it does what it does well so moisturize plump hydrate act as a really good humectant but it doesn't do much beyond that yeah i totally agree it fits its role serves its purpose may not need a dedicated like product for this ingredient but it's something you can't have in your ingredient list just somewhere right so it's an extra step that's not necessarily required for a really great skincare routine but also i just don't like people sort of over promise what it can do that it's gonna boost your collagen or have long-term anti-aging benefits it's going to do what it does on the skin while it's on the skin but as soon as that's away it's not going to have any long-term benefits like your retinoids which we love so much which do have long-term benefits your topical hyaluronic acids are really just more moisturizing yeah this seems to be a theme with us like if we're really picky about things that over promise just i guess it's just because it's really common out there you know there's not a lot of responsibility in marketing right now you can just kind of make a claim and you really don't have to substantiate it in any which way and so we kind of i guess we kind of both get flustered is that the word i wanted to say we both get riled up we both get upset i don't know so we just both like really lost all his words today we're shooting in the evening we usually shoot in the morning so he's losing i'm a morning person i'm a night person so it's true that any company can make any claim right you can go to any store you can go to sephora ulta and it can make outrageous anti-aging claims who can't make false claims are pharmaceutical companies so prescription medications cannot make claims that are not substantiated and approved by the fda so the thing that a lot of people are often worried about are pharmaceuticals and how dangerous those could potentially be but those are actually extremely highly regulated to the point where they cannot make any off-brand claim yeah they almost shoot themselves in the foot and actually that actually is really concerning to me because some of these companies go the extra mile to prove that their product works to an extraordinary extraordinary length but then once they do that they pigeonhole themselves and they can't talk about anything else they haven't gone that extra 10 000 steps to do so you know if we want companies to do research we really have to take the time to you know put our dollars and buy the products or the research is behind so just be aware that there's much difference between a prescription medication and what you can find over the counter hyaluronic acid overrated agreed all right next ingredient niacinamide niacinamide i'm actually really glad we're talking about this again uh because you know we actually did a video up for this a long time ago like three cameras ago on the couch totally different setting but over the last few months last couple months i've rededicated efforts to look into all the natural ingredients i can't find anything wrong with niacinamide i just i just can't do it it's just well-rounded yeah so it is sort of the fit all ingredients so it does so many different things so if you can go back and watch our nice cinema video we kind of said that it does meet the hype so people are always talking about niacinamide and what it can do it just has all the studies to substantiate the claims that are made about it so uh what would you say overhyped or underrated overrated i'd actually say underrated i know people already like it they are some people already love it but i still think it's underrated i think people should be going out of their way to use this ingredient more i would say appropriately rated because it's just so hyped up right like especially 2020 there was like 100 skin care brands that i came out with niacinamide products so i think it was underrated probably like it's probably now getting it's getting the hype it deserves i'm with you you know that's fair you know getting the hype it deserves we're gonna disagree on a few of these yeah but here's the reason why i say that though you know if you're looking for a topical vitamin there are actually very few that aren't irritating which is kind of bizarre to think about but niacinamide is one of the very few antioxidants with topical soothing properties i mean not soothing but it works in sensitive skin it's been studied in atopic dermatitis which is the poster child for sensitive skin and then it also has a mirror to benefits including unique ones such as decreasing oil production it just i have a hard time imagining an ingredient that does more yeah it does a little bit of everything and it's a great supporting ingredient in almost any skin care regimen so you can add it to your acne routine you can add it to your sensitive skincare routine you can add it to a redness routine someone who's got rosacea you can add it to pretty much anything and it's going to have a lot of benefits it even moisturizes the skin to some degree right so niacinamide i agree totally excellent ingredient i personally use niacinamide in my skincare routine but there's been a myriad of nice cinnamon products to come out and like we said in our other video you don't necessarily need a dedicated niacinamide product just because your moisturizer may have nine cinnamide so that's kind of where i'm at where i'm like okay it got hyped because it deserved hype and then it's like all right we're good we got it it's fair okay i also didn't know there was this third category of like it's exactly where it should be oh yeah we're making up the rules as we go along here all right so overrated underrated so i'm sticking with it i'll say underrated stamp appropriately rated stamp all right my fourth option stamp is coming in soon it is what it is i make up the rules as i go so this next one is honey honey honey in my opinion underrated so everybody knows i'm against putting food on the skin been against it we'll always be against it and there are a few exceptions to this and the reason why i think honey is underrated and i know you're probably going to disagree with me on this is that of all the things that i've seen in homemade masks have pretty much no evidence at all there are very few exceptions to this where green tea turmeric and honey tend to actually have some evidence behind them it would make sense in a mask now are there studies to potentially support that in an anti-aging regimen probably not but at the end of the day it's a pretty safe ingredient it has known anti-inflammatory properties it has uh antibacterial properties it has moisturizing properties so if you're going to do a homemade mask and you're putting together some ingredients from your kitchen one that i would support is honey and there is a tremendous amount of research in manuka honey for wounds so i think it's underrated so okay you may have bumped me from i was gonna say i would lean towards overrated because again just like last ingredient i think this is something where it over promises sometimes i think there's a ton of data about how this works in the lab how it works for wound healing but outside of that then you start getting into just conjecture and it's not been shown to be helpful for something like acne as compared to topical soap which we know is not a treatment for acne so i'll say appropriately rated almost begrudgingly because he's right i think it's it has a tremendous potential upside we need more data on honey someone please help us put this together definitely very little very little downside very safe ingredient it's okay i'll say stamp appropriately rated okay underrated i approve of honey i'm gonna plant my approved this is like another thing i'm approving it now not only do you think underrated and approved underrated and approved tasty also also edible edible all right next up big big ingredient and we're a little cautious to take this one down but vitamin c vitamin c so we have heavy hitters today this is just blowing my mind so vitamin c has some very possible upside um i'll go with well i have to go with overrated no appropriately rated overrated i'm gonna plant my flag so big fan of vitamin c again no appropriately rated yeah this is hard this is a hard game you know what it is because it's so hyped it's so hype it's like niacinamide to me it's like it got so much hype and there's like you can find vitamin c in anything yeah but it really does have a lot of studies to support it um not only orally but also topically in mood healing from anti-aging to anti-pigment to every you know so many studies on on vitamin c it has some of those niche properties that are kind of hard to come by it helps with this pigmentation collagen growth helps brighten the skin and then you get to like some of the scientific nuance like is it stable does it get absorbed by the skin i think that's where some of our hesitation lies is we kind of know that i don't we we're kind of uncertain as to how well this actually penetrates and acts uh in real life i agree i completely agree with that so that's that's the the whole downside of vitamin c it comes to formulation it has a lot of difficulty penetrating the skin especially at the ph that it's stable at and then the fact that it's not lipid soluble meaning that it doesn't get through our skin barrier pretty easily it just makes it so difficult to think that it's going to go through the skin get into the dermis and be that essential cofactor that we need to build collagen we do know that has antioxidant benefits uh to basically fight away free radicals that come from the sun so vitamin c is one of those things where if it worked the way it does in theory right it would be extremely underrated but the fact that it's so difficult to put in a skincare formula and the fact that it gets so much hype by everyone where it's essentially the thing that everyone touts is like you have to have it in your skincare routine yeah so that's why i say appropriately rated and i would say that what do you think do you think it's a necessary part of a skincare routine it depends on your treating but so if you're honestly if you're treating this pigmentation i would say after retinoids niacinamide it's right up there it's like a tier two ingredient it has a lake acid so it's like a solid tier two ingredient for just pigmentation so what i do like vitamin c for is that particularly i like to use it in the morning and this is up for debate depending on who you talk to some people say use it at night because of the collagen building benefits and the fact that it's not necessarily that stable in the sun some people say use it during the day me because of its antioxidant benefits and also because it doesn't layer well with a lot of ingredients that we use at night like acids and retinol so i just prefer to use it during the day and i like it in routines for anti-aging and hyperpigmentation i do you do he does i still think no that's still fair i still think it's only appropriately rated though i think that's also true okay so i think we're in agreement on this yeah we are vitamin c appropriately rated appropriately rated okay next up we have azolic acid underrated underrated in my opinion so i put out a video so those of you don't know i am very active on tick tock and got active about over almost almost a year ago now on tick tock and one of the first videos that i posted that like exploded was basically saying that azelaic acid was underrated since then it's definitely gotten more hype since then uh but i still think that people aren't talking about it enough yeah that's fair it's it's funny actually at this point you know all app patients come in and say something and we're like ah yeah no dr shaw he brought that to light now it's like sold out at the stupid store but i agree i think as lake acid still kind of harbors the underrated category it just is so great and has such a well-defined mechanism for treating this pigmentation um i just think it's very effective at what it does it can be bought at a pretty affordable price now um the ordinary has a great ten percent aselic acid and the price point for that is perfect yeah so that's extremely affordable um paul's choice has one the only caveat with that one is that it's formulated with salicylic acid so even though most azelaic acid formulations are safe in pregnancy i would not use that formulation of azelaic acid in pregnancy notorium has one as well and i think that there are other ones that are on the horizon so we'll put some links below for azelaic acid but i completely agree it's underrated because it treats acne and it treats hyperpigmentation which is so nice because if you have acne and you're forming dark spots afterwards i mean it's going to treat both of them while they're happening it inhibits tyrosinase which is an enzyme that produces pigment in the skin so the mechanism makes a lot of sense to me and it's mildly exfoliates the skin as well so it just has so many benefits especially somebody who's acne hyperpigmentation dull skin texture and because it's safe in pregnancy it's just one of those ingredients i feel like we should be talking more about definitely a good tier two ingredient as well can put this into your regimen pretty safely and easily i have this solidly i guess as an underrated underrated agreement all right here's a good one i've been thinking about this one a lot ceramides what do you think about ceramides actually i've been thinking about this a lot too uh i've been on an eczema kick for a while and in people with atopic dermatitis or eczema they don't make as much ceramide so ceramide is like a functional foundational necessary lipid that your skin makes and it helps protect it from water loss and a lot of other things ceramide is an ingredient i think it's actually still underrated but that's a hard it's a hard underrated because it's gotten really popular with cerave yeah so well that's a good point so there are a lot of moisturizers that have ceramides in them but because cerave has basically said they put three essential ceramides in all of their products and because of that it's sort of brought light to ceramides which were found in a lot of moisturizers that were approved by the the eczema society so i look at the skin like a brick wall essentially and the bricks are like these corneocytes which are just skin cells that don't have nuclei at the top of the skin and ceramides are actually in between them so they're basically like the mortar so they're keeping things out they're keeping things in you know they're they're doing a lot of things and they're essential right they're essential ceramides so actually syrupy has it right they're essential ceramides we need them and um they're actually in a very particular ratio in the skin compared to other lipids so we actually have to have a particular ratio and ceramides are actually the most abundant lipid in that top layer of the skin so essential i think it's an excellent part to have in a moisturizer so i encourage you all to look for moisturizers with ceramides in them especially if you have an impaired skin barrier or underlying condition like atopic dermatitis we'll list some products below that have ceramides in them serum obviously you know i'm kind of like a we'll talk about this maybe at another time but i'm kind of like a sentimental person so if i have like an emotional connection to a particular brand or product you know i just like so the story with cerave is essentially that i it was the first moisturizer i ever used and so for that reason i was like you know i'm attached to it in that way so that's why i'm like a big fan of ceremonies because it makes some sense for me cerave is like napoleon dynamite um i heard so much about it and i've heard so much about it i'm kind of sick of it but i can't get away from it because it's actually a great product like it's a great product line of great ingredients and we've been recommending it dermatology for decades so it's hard to get mad at the hype of serbia because you're like well we've been recommending it forever and now it's hyped and you're like uh but the only thing i'm mad about is actually that it's selling out now everywhere because it's been so hyped up and you know i feel sort of guilty about it and um you know i know that some people have tagged me in videos with kids that have eczema and not being able to find products so now actually kind of try not to hype up things like the cerebellar healing ointment because i don't want it to sell out for people that don't necessarily need it even though it's a great product that's true um you know it's like one of those things where we kind of have responsibilities but for that reason you know we'll link those below because there are a lot of other great moisturizers with ceramides in them for you so ceramides ceramides uh underrated underrated i agree so that wraps up our underrated overrated part one this time we were talking about ingredients next time we're going to be talking about things like skincare devices skincare routines i don't know any we can do this to anything right let us know if you guys like this game if you enjoy this format or what you want us to put in our next

        "published_at": "2022-10-11T03:45:23Z",
        "transcript": "foreign board certified dermatologist welcome to my channel today's video is a really cool fun video where you could be walking through Target and you see these colorful bottles being on display and like oh what's this LaRoche Posay brand and what's with these cool serums that are up on display so the big question is how do we incorporate there are three main serums we all love how uranic acid serums for Plumping and we love vitamin C for brightening the skin meaning lightning dark spots and then our favorite Retinol for a bunch of different things that we'll talk about I've been to the town of La Roche Jose and that's a town in France we took a train out there and I got to try their mineral water that's under the town and they bring it up and they pump it up to the surface and they harvest it and make it into these great skincare products because it's filled with a blend of unique minerals that are great for your skin and also the water tasted really good it's a little thicker milkier texture filled with selenium and other great minerals and so now let's go through the serum so value B5 how ub5 is great before a big event like before I went on the Today Show or going on the news or giving a big talk I'm going to use a hyaluronic acid serum now the high ub5 has of course hyaluronic acid and B5 B5 is panthenol or Pro vitamin B5 that's a great moisturizing and hydrating ingredient that you see in your moisturizers very commonly hyaluronic acid as you guys know is a water magnet it's a humectant that draws in water it's probably the OG of humectants now but glycerin is also up there and gluconolactone and so what also makes this really nice is that it has Mata castaicide and The Craze around centella asiatica is still ongoing and so madagasa side might have anti-aging properties as well I just love the smell of this I know there are people who are sensitive to fragrance but the smell of this reminds me of the start of social media really is so it's very nostalgic so after you cleanse your face you apply this onto damp skin it really does retain all that moisture you got from your cleanse and it helps with hiding the fine lines and wrinkles in your forehead like crow's feet around on your eyes and so I really like how ub5 and the smell doesn't bother me at all but if you do have a problem fragrance yes these products do have fragrance and so keep that in mind this would be in the morning you can use this at bedtime too if you have a big event you can do this before going to sleep and if you're going to use a retinol cream or prescription tretinoin you can apply that over this in layers very well apply this and then follow up with a moisturizer to lock in the hyaluronic acid Serum with the moisture so it doesn't evaporate and leave and so you can keep that plump in action going okay next the vitamin C serum I have not talked about this on my channel yet this is a great vitamin C serum great for beginners it has 10 ascorbic acid ascorbic acid is an active form of vitamin C this one has also salicylic acid and neural sensing salicylic acid you find it mixed with vitamin C more and more readily because they actually play together very nicely combining them on your own you could but be very careful irritation Laura Jose has formulated into a very gentle way where they work together well where you get the exfoliation the cleaning of your pores the salicylic acid the also get the brightening effect with the exfoliation I always say exfoliation in a gentle is like polishing the skin and just gives you that little bit of that extra glow and so the vitamin C serum is very solid it does have neural sensing which is great for soothing the skin especially if you have acne rosacea and you're very sensitive to different products neurosensity is great for those of rosacea critique for it would be that it does oxidize quite quickly and this is a pricier bottle it's not super expensive like SkinCeuticals but it is 30 to 40 bucks is quite a bit for a skincare product that's one fluid ounce and so I'd have to say if you're going to get this put this in the fridge I don't usually say you need a skincare fridge but put this in the fridge just to maintain this Integrity a little longer because it does oxidize quickly this is a brand new bottle here so I just want to show you here what it looks like and this one also has that unique smell if you want to use both you can use both the hyaluronic acid and the vitamin C serum but I like to alternate just because I don't like to mix the fragrance this has its own smell and so you know I like to use one or the other I like to alternate someday days I'll do vitamin C some days I'll just do hyaluronic acid so I'm nice I'll use hyaluronic acid vitamin C don't usually mix with retinol or retinoids because it can cause more irritation especially this time of year when it's colder in the fall and winter but if you're an advanced user you technically could mix the two together they don't deactivate each other or turn into Time Bomb if they do get mixed but you do increase the risk of irritation if you do combine the two now ascorbic acid I like that they use pure vitamin C in this so ascorbic acid 10 percent is usually a good start for those who are beginners to vitamin C but you can go up to you know like 25 with Obagi and such so 10 great way to start but just be careful with oxidation you probably want to use the jar up within four months as my guess here I want to show you though this is a Vichy vitamin C and this is a great vitamin C serum but I just want to show you when it oxidizes look at that look at that color there it's more than Amber it's actually like brown and so that's oxidized for sure and lastly we got the retinol B3 so retinol B3 this is of course retinol it has gradual release retinol and so it's going to be gradually released throughout the day it's very gentle for those who are beginners now why do we care about retinol retinal helps increase cell turnover helps lighten dark spots helps keep our pores clean and also helps with fine lines and wrinkles by increasing collagen production the B3 is niacinamide which is our favorite ingredient it's very versatile helps regulate sebum Productions anti-inflammatory it helps to let in dark spots or brighten the skin and so I love that it's paired with retinol because they work together very well like niacinamide in my sunscreens cleansers moisturizers but with the retinol they just work synergistically together so I'm really glad LaRoche Posay put niacinamide with this so I just want to show you the bottle looks like a cool red color but it's not actually red it has that classic retinol yellow color now this one's also a nice one to go so I'm going to put this over the how ub5 and then you'd follow up with the moisturizer and La Roche Posse has great moisturizers they have the lipicard the zika plus bomb if your Skin's very irritated and needs soothing the cycoplast bomb is good Lipa car is great if you for body and face you can get the ephocarb the matte moisturizer if you have oilier skin but you still want to use one to offset the potential irritation you might get from your retinol that's also a nice one to do so I like this one a lot this one one of my favorite over-the-counter retinols out there it's worth the price very nice Supply to my skin I feel like it's also very hydrating and Plumping as well it works very well if they're high how you'll be five to be honest I actually do keep them all these separate in my skincare routine and I usually use retinol at bedtime because sunlight can deactivate your retinol there are photo staple retinols out there but I just like my habit use it at bedtime so I'll do is I'll wash my face let it dry and then apply the Retinol Serum over it you don't want to put it on damp skin because the retinol could absorb too quickly into your skin and cause irritation which we don't want obviously right we want to be consistent with our retinol game if we get irritation we're gonna have to pause our skincare game and then unfortunately we won't be getting the results as fast and the results being the lightning of your dark spots to increase collagen production which can take four to six months or more of consistent use to before you see the Improvement in your skin tone texture that bounce we all want and so we want to be go at it in a gentle way when you start off on a retinol you might want to start off every other night or maybe a couple times in the first week at bedtime and then increase to Nightly as tolerated just a summary this I use at bedtime after washing onto dry skin not damp and then you can follow up with a moisturizer your how you B5 let's point to the big guy here big bombucha how you be five this big boy you can apply morning and night after a cleanse when your skin is damp and then follow up with some form of moisturizer vitamin C you can use it morning or night you can use it morning and night and you can do this on damp or dry skin and this works well with other actives but be careful when mixing it with a retinoid especially a prescription retinoid I usually do keep them separate so I hope this video was helpful I hope this isn't too confusing going over three different serums but I had a great time kind of comparing and talking about all three please drop some comments below to tell me your favorite serum and also please share with your friends who like share serums anti-aging skin care please like the video and subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next video guys appreciate you all peace",

        "transcript": "Sonia yes you know what month it is right no what month is it it's National rosacea awareness month so it's really great for rosacea sensitive skin and I'm somebody who's really reactive with rosacea so when we're first talking about rosacea in general we're really looking at what in the skin we gotta talk about it well what would you use to treat rosacea okay first of all my Trio for rosacea is gonna be aloe and calendula coming Mist Chrono calm serum and then Rose ease relief cream um so these are going to be really awesome if you do suffer from rosacea these are going to help to treat the redness help to treat inflammation sensitivity in the skin and you can actually mix your Chrono bomb and your Alum calendula calming Mist to help make your product spread a little bit easier and last longer this wouldn't be too stimulating for rosacea or sensitive skin you know it's really great for rosacea sensitive skin um but again if you're looking at different grades of rosacea I mean there's a number of different subtypes there's four different subtypes of rosacea subtype 3 would probably be the top end that you see but within subtype 2 you have a pretty broad range of diffuse redness and what we would call Pop wheels and pustules in fact subtype two is called papillopuscular rosacea so you just have to be wary of how extreme that subtitude if it's at the very top end they may experience some discomfort but even water can be discomforting for clients that are experiencing that level of severity of rosacea as a solo it's always to find a brand that like like um and there and their products really do and I'm somebody who's really reactive with rosacea so it's hard to find a whole line and brand that you can use everything in and I've tried everything and I've never had any issues and everything works really well and they're professional treatments too um just are beyond amazing like after one you see a difference even just facial like it's superficial facial I see a difference with their products so it's they're amazing that's awesome so I made the right decision on that one personally just for me because I have rosacea it's going to be the Chrono calm and the Rosie's relief cream because those work maybe for my skin um but I'm in love with everything um but I think for my clients again because I deal with more like pigmentation issues um and anti-aging um definitely like the bright white serum they love um super lightweight but it really targets those pigment um and then I'd have to see the myocyte plus because everybody's looking for that like botox without Botox right so that one's amazing too so when we're first talking about rosacea in general we're really looking at what in the skin an inflammatory response due to an overpopulation of a little facial Mite that we all have and if you want to be fun and sciency the Demodex follicularum facial night which is the might we all have on our skin right which is probably something that we don't want to know but those who suffer from rosacea have a higher population of the Mite and more of a sensitivity to their byproducts when we look at somebody who's sensitive or who has a compromised barrier what are we looking at that's different than rosacea so with someone who is presenting with a compromised barrier we're not going to see the localized redness or erythema around the nose and cheeks we're going to see a systemic redness and typically pretty dry profile as well because they're unable to really retain a lot of that moisture so they have advanced rates of trans epidermal water loss we have two different cleanser options for rosacea would you recommend using these both AM and PM or would you recommend one for day and one for night that's such a great question because it can go either way for a client who has a little more disruption to their barrier you may start with vitamin Veil only until their barrier is a little bit healthier but if their barrier is pretty good and they just need a little management for those rosacea areas usually nose and cheek then you can do vitamin Veil following with lipid replacing cleansing gel in general though if the clientele is a little bit more mature they tend to love the vitamin Veil and the little veil of vitamins the emollient seed Left Behind which really helps to protect the skin but for younger clientele that may be struggling with rosacea they tend to like a little more of that clean I hate to say the word squeaky clean because we all know that's not not so good but lipid replacing cleansing gel will give them that really nice thorough cleansed feel without disrupting the barrier so you're not going to be making the problem worse yeah I think that's the biggest thing to note with both of the options for cleansers with circadia for rosacea both of them are going to keep the Integrity of the barrier in place and help to fortify it versus stripping it or breaking it down so both of these are going to be wonderful options I think it's really important to note that a lot of our rosacea clientele tend to be heavy makeup wearers because they're trying to cover that redness that they haven't been able to find a true solution for and so the vitamin Veil is going to really grip bond to that makeup oil dirt debris within the skin so we can remove it a big part of a rosacea client's problem is that they're typically not cleansing thoroughly enough because their skin doesn't usually feel good after so this is going to be a really beautiful solution for them the next step in both your am and your PM regimen is going to be the aloe and calendula calming Mist so this mist is one of my favorite products within the collection for sensitive and rosacea skin because it has the same Purity and potency as your traditional serums do but it's just in a really nice misting application so you can apply this more than twice a day really you can apply it multiple times throughout the day and it has really good healing calming hydrating properties to it and especially in the evening with your circadian rhythms you have an increase in heat in the evenings so using the aloe Mist to have that nice hydrating misting application is really good for you know what I love too A lot of times with rosacea clients their little cheekies get so warm and hot so if you pop your aloe and calendula Mist in the fridge chef's kiss yes just so calming refreshing with rosacea clients and the barrier being disrupted a lot of the vitamin C's that are currently on the market are formulated with a pH that's a little too low and that can cause surface redness irritation stinging sensation and for those whose barrier are very compromised it's going to result in even a little topical chemical burn and so with our vitamin C it's in a hyaluronic acid base so it's going to be very hydrating and we utilize magnesium a scorable phosphate so this is a very very stable form of vitamin C it'll never oxidize and the Beautiful part is because of that magnesium and that phosphate and the hyaluronic acid base it raises the pH to be a very neutral right about seven which is the same pH as water so this is going to be incredibly tolerable for your clientele while helping to really get the Integrity back into their skin I would say this is probably the number one product for rosacea so again as Chris mentioned you can see it's this really Crystal Clear consistency it won't ever oxidize and then it goes on really clear and it absorbs really nicely into the skin almost immediately so the other beautiful thing is the post peel balm I think is one of the most beautiful bases for makeup as well because it gives you that little bit of extra smoothing and as you can tell we are just having the best time here no pilling up no greasy especially if we're talking about sensitive or rosacea clientele with a disrupted barrier this is going to help to be almost their barrier until their own natural barrier is fully repaired agreed this is where all of those heavy hitter reduction in redness and calming agents and peptides and ingredients are are going to be in so you can take either one of these cleansers and you can use them in the evening as well and then again you're always going to want to use your aloe and calendula calming Mist multiple times a day but definitely am routine and PM routine so you'll cleanse with one of your either vitamin Veil cleanser or lipid replacing cleansing gel your aloe mist and then the Chrono calm I'll let Chris talk a little about Chrono calm because she says she has three favorite products but secretly I think this is like number one on your roster it switches it'll probably change as we talk about other restaurants but I do we are in a committed relationship chronocom and I this is such a beautiful beautiful product to really work on the inflammatory state of the skin and the way that it calms down redness and nourishes your natural immunity for your skin which is really your logger hunt cells so we have op beta glucan in here which is what the loggerhan cells feed off of it's what they need to eat and those cells are a dendritic cell down in the deeper layer of your skin and they're responsible for getting rid of environmental pollution bacteria infection so this is going to help to really restore the health and integrity to the skin from within and it's such a beautiful anti-redness agent as well whether you have rosacea and you have redness from that or whether you have redness from just disrupted barrier or doing something crazy you saw on Tick Tock or the internet um don't trust tick tock it happens so one the anti-redness ingredient in here that Chris is talking about it's a peptide called talangean and it's actually the number one anti-redness peptide on the market so you'll also see with this it is a little bit cloudier of a consistency than the micro or the vitamin C reversal serum but it does still have that same hyaluronic acid base so it's incredibly hydrating it has the amazing anti-redness peptide in here the oat beta glucan as you mentioned and Dr puglies is our founder and formulator and he was actually doing some some clinical work on beta glucan and he applied topical beta-glucan to the skin and he actually visibly saw the longer Han cells reaching up to grab the beta glucans so it's incredibly helpful and beneficial for the compromised skin and helping with the immune supports of course after they do their Chrono calm my other love of my let's see it's already happened my other love of my life Tranquility cream this is your bread and butter this is another one of your very powerful agents for rosacea and this is going to be your nourishing cream for night nice and creamy It Feels So comforting and a big piece of sensitive sensitized reactive and rosacea skin is there's so much discomfort and we have a beautiful ingredient in here called delicence did I say it right delicence delicence which helps to really calm down those sensitized receptors and calm down that pain response which is also great for the evening when some of those receptors are at their heights now the difference between your sensitive skin and a true subtype rosacea everything is really going to stay the same as far as your regimen we're just adding in one additional product and this is the Rosie's relief cream now Dr puglies again who is our amazing founder and formulator he was doing extensive research on the Demodex Mite that Chris had mentioned before and how we can decrease or eliminate the population so through his research he found a proprietary blend of different essential oils that was actually designed to asphyxiate this might so he took all of the research that he was doing and he put it into a lovely retail cream that can be applied as a treatment cream so this is going to help to decrease or eliminate the population of the mites so we can actually address the underlying inflammatory components of this particular skin condition this has a a strong Rosemary extract in it which you would think Rosemary can be slightly stimulating so that's why we only suggest to use this a couple of times a week to get started so you would want to apply it every other day making sure that your skin can adapt to it and it's going to be a PM application only and when we say PM application with this and Target treating you're gonna really be targeting those areas where you see those red flares and our traditional rosacea flares happening at and just as a fun fact that Demodex might feeds on oil which is why we tend to see these flares in the high oil production places around the nose the little cheeks and sometimes forehead or chin because those are our highest oil production areas I must say men fall in love with this cream I have some clients who's the woman has rosacea and uses this and the men just full force their whole face with it because it has such a nice almost woodsy scent to it and it's very refreshing my Heavy Hitters for rosacea is going to depend on what subtype you are if you're a subtype one which is your more mild you can get away with the Tranquility cream and chronocom and that's really what's going to handle your rosacea but anything other than a subtype one you really do need to add in the Rosie's relief cream for them because that's their true solution to mitigating those flares and for someone who's subtype one when they're stressed or when they're sick they may need Rosie's relief because whenever we're stressed or sick our immune system decreases and we see a boom in the population of these mites and I think one of the things to to notice too is the big point of differentiation between a subtype one and a subtype two is those papules and pustules so we know that you can really differentiate your lower subtypes of rosacea from your higher subtypes when you're seeing that through your skin analysis so that's when you know that it's really time to bring in the Heavy Hitters and really start to use the Rosie's relief cream at home absolutely we just had a core and she's beautiful and Brilliant but when we mentioned the demo Dax bug she didn't know who we're talking about and then you jumped right in so how does the Demodex bug affect rosacea skin and what are some of the signs and symptoms that it might be flaring up and when is it time to actually use these products great questions so when um we talk about the Diamondbacks might um really what's happening is that everyone has this Smite on their skin what's the difference between me you and a rosacea fine well that client is having a reaction to the byproduct or the debris of this might and so what we see is that they get a lot of inflammation some popular activity um just a lot of discomfort redness so what we see is that that is when we want to start incorporating these products to help with the redness help with the inflammation also help to control some of that oil production because that is why typically we see it in the T-Zone area um because the Demodex white loves to feed off of oil so yeah absolutely and these are all packed with essential oils Botanicals so it's not some people that have rosacea they're worried about harsh treatments or something causing irritation and these are so incredibly gentle that it also reduces redness but also creates an environment for for healing and anti-inflammatory so you can kind of get that healthy glow back without that irritation and redness",

        "transcript": "well hey guys i'm here at walgreens and in this video we're going to go through the skincare i'm going to share with you what to use when you're starting tretinoin i'm going to give you tips on how to incorporate certain ingredients and importantly i'm going to show you what products ingredients and habits to avoid when you are using tretinoin if you're new here welcome my name is andrea i'm a board-certified dermatologist and i have a lot of content here on youtube all about retinoids retin-a explaining what they do what they don't do and busting a lot of myths about them so check those videos out but let's head on in [Music] first up i'm over here by some petrol autumn ointments we have cerave healing ointment we have aquaphor and we have the walgreens version getting an ointment is a great idea if you're going to be starting a retinoid because uh you want to put the retinoid to your face but you want to avoid getting it on the delicate skin of your eyelids you want to avoid getting it around your nose and around your mouth especially the corners it can be super irritating in these areas so i suggest putting a little tiny dot of a petrolatum ointment like this or vaseline or aquaphor to those areas before applying your treadmill yeah it'll help protect those areas from tretinoin it can just be too irritating there especially around the eyes can make your eyes even dry so put a thin layer of this around the eyes around the mouth and around the nose comment below and if you remember my video showing you how to use different back in the day i would say grease the orifices and that's exactly what you should do it'll help keep that tretinoin from getting to those areas and causing a lot of irritation and you can use good old vaseline too or even the generic version [Music] all right now when you use tretinoin you want to apply it to a clean face but you want to avoid washing your face with a really harsh cleanser so i just suggest a mild cleanser this one by aveeno the common resource restore nourishing oat cleanser is great i'll show you some other ones this is another great option from la roche-posay the lipicare wash ap you can use this both on the face and the body so a double it's a double hitter you can you know use it in your shower wash your face wash your body and get out of the shower sometimes foaming cleansers can be a little bit more on the drying side it's not always true but you may find that if you were using a cleanser in the past like this one that says normal to oily skin you may find that it is now a little bit too drying for you if you're starting trending on now cerave's hydrating facial cleanser would be another great choice alternatively you could save a few dollars and get the walgreens version or if you're a fan of the bars i highly suggest their bar soap regardless you just want a mild cleanser to wash your face you want to avoid really harsh overly scented soaps this cleanser from derma geek is another good gentle cleanser that you would benefit from using with a retinoid [Music] now it's fine to wear makeup when you're starting tretinoin but if you wear a lot of it you may find that the mild cleansers i've suggested are not enough to adequately remove your makeup and you may find that you need to spend a lot of time rubbing in which case i suggest using like a cleansing balm first or a cleansing oil like this one by albaleen pond's cold cream is another great option for removing makeup prior to using a mild cleanser it just helps break up the film of like foundation mascara sunscreen which is another super important product to incorporate this is a great one from a van they're extremely gentle cleanser lotion it does a really nice job breaking up like mascara too you can use it around your eyes [Music] all right speaking of sunscreen true or false tretinoin makes your skin more sensitive to the sun the answer is false it doesn't actually make your skin more sensitive to the sun it actually helps your skin handle the ravages of uv better but you do need to wear sunscreen and in general your skin is going to just be more sensitive but it's not as though tretinoin is uv sensitizing so it doesn't make you more likely to burn but you definitely need to be wearing sunscreen you should be wearing sunscreen regardless these by la roche posay are all fantastic i really especially like the melting sunscreen milk if you have an oilier skin type especially it's non-greasy it's water resistant so it doesn't run into your eyes they have an spf 60 version as well then i also like the mineral one the cast on this is pretty mild for an spf 50 mineral sunscreen it's water resistant if you have really sensitive skin and again when you start using tretinoin you may find your skin is a little bit more sensitive to burning and burning and stinging you may find that you prefer a mineral sunscreen to a chemical one but the laroche jose chemical sunscreens which what these are these are great they don't burn me at least it's kind of an individual outcome but regardless these are great speaking of mineral sunscreen this one by a van is also really nice if you wanted a mineral sunscreen it's a little pricey though but i highly suggest the event tinted mineral compact especially if you wear like wearing makeup this actually gives a really good cosmetic camouflage coverage it stays in place well it's easy to reapply it's easy to spread on the skin so these compacts are great this one by cerave is pretty zinky the cast is pretty noticeable but they make a tinted one that i really like that's just a great option this one by cetaphil the sheer mineral face there is a cast to this but it's pretty mild and this is a nice lightweight liquid formula and i've recently discovered these new eucerin products these new user and sunscreens the age defense is really moisturizing it's not greasy this would be another good option i haven't tried the sensitive mineral i imagine there's a white cast to that and i've seen people on instagram try these out and say that they're that they burn and sting around the eyes but for me personally this age defense one or the oil control one neither of these caused any burning or stinging for me around the eyes they're both they would both be a great option this coppertone sport mineral would be another good one i suggest avoiding sunscreens with fragrance in them because it can be more irritating when you're using tretinoin especially in the beginning [Music] so if you weren't aware the first several weeks of using tretinoin your skin's going to get really dry it's going to peel and it's going to be more sensitive so one way to reduce that is to make sure you use a moisturizer you can apply moisturizer either before or after you apply tretinoin it really doesn't matter but just using a moisturizer will help the tolerability of treadmill and so this one by goldman i personally really like it's got hyaluronic acid ceramides which are helpful for skin barrier recovery i also really like to use the syrupy moisturizing cream on my face but a lot of people complain that this burns and stings we have the walgreens version so like the savino calm and restore oat gel moisturizer it has extracts from scentella which are also helpful for skin barrier recovery and it's not greasy it's very lightweight it has oats which are very moisturizing that's a good option but it is it is a little expensive but it's one of my favorite skincare products i like this product from cetaphil they're rich hydrating cream for dried and normal sensitive skin this is a great option too to use one of the things that can happen with tretinoin is especially in the beginning i mentioned you know you're gonna your skin can be more sensitive vulnerable to getting chapped dry you can have a lot of peeling irritation that is a sign that the skin barrier is impaired and that can happen and that's part of the retinization process with with tretinoin so i suggest this the zikaplast balm uh it's a dimethicone based skin protectant with shea butter and medeca side as a compound from scintilla that's helpful for healing this is really soothing and great for the irritation issue that you may experience especially with mask wearing you're going to find that starting tretinoin or using treadmill and then where if you're wearing masks you can have even more irritation this is really great under the mask especially it reduces friction on the skin from the mask that can further irritate your skin so that's another great product to consider all right let's talk about flakes in the beginning when you develop dryness irritation the skin can get flaky from tretinoin in the beginning and a lot of people are tempted to like exfoliate that get you know some kind of appeal or whatever that ends up worsening it because the flakes really are exfoliating skin so you don't want to attempt to exfoliate exfoliating oils are normally by themselves not like the most ideal moisturizer because they don't really lock in hydration but for the purpose of flakiness a facial oil or this neutrogena body oil just a teeny tiny drop gently massage it over the flakes in a circular fashion the oil i see this is sesame oil the oil just slips between those cornea sides they're called kind of helps them naturally dislodge deposits some soothing moisturizing emollient behind and it doesn't aggravate the skin like trying to exfoliate wood now i know a lot of people like to rag on this product however i do not suggest using any kind of scrub if you're going to be using a retinoid because scrubs they do cause little tiny micro erosions on the skin as the materials the walnut shells and whatnot are abrasive and when you go and put treadmill on over that it's going to be really irritating so i suggest avoiding cleansing scrubs or any kind of scrub all right here's something to avoid this product is actually great by the way this alpha hydroxy face cream but when you put tretinoin on you don't want to apply an alpha hydroxy acid product at the same time it's gonna be too irritating in the beginning i would suggest avoiding products like this all together as your skin is getting accustomed to the retinoid and then maybe three four five months into using the retinoid consistently as long as you're not having any dryness or peeling or irritation you could consider using a product like this in the morning likewise here we have an alpha hydroxy acid peel pad from l'oreal you would not want to use this and apply tretinoin at the same time so like you wouldn't want to you're going to be using tretinoin in your nighttime routine most likely you would not want to use this at the same time alpha hydroxy acids include glycolic acid mandelic acid lactic acid so in this video we're talking about skin care to use and or avoid when using tretinoin which is a prescription topical medication that is used to treat acne but a lot of people use it for improving wrinkles and fine lines so a lot of people ask me should we keep using our retinols or can we alternate tretinoin with retinol and i suggest avoiding all retinol products when you are using prescription tretinoin because it doesn't add anything of benefit it just increases the risk of irritation so here we have a retinol by rock this is really popular they're deep wrinkle filler and of course there is the walgreens version i mean there are a lot of retinols see retinol is different from tretinoin unlike tretinoin retinol has to undergo two conversion steps in your skin in order for it to be retinoic acid which is what tretinoin is so tretinoin's already retinoic acid so you're basically not getting anything additional by using a retinol but you will have even more irritation if you combine the two together all right so a lot of people use tretinoin for acne i mean that's what it is it was originally used for and then the wrinkle thing was discovered accidentally much later so if you do have acne um then you got to be careful with benzoyl peroxide this is another one you don't want to apply at the same time as tretinoin because benzoyl peroxide not only will it make it a lot more irritating it also can compromise the stability of the tretinoin this is one to use in the morning routine neutrogena even kind of advises you in that way here because it says am treatment this one by neutrogena is actually very good it's a micronized benzoyl peroxide so it's less irritating this would be a good one if you are still having breakouts with treadmill all right so here we have some benzoyl peroxide washes and a lot of people ask well can i wash my face with this first and then put tretinoin on you can that won't like inactivate it or anything it's just depending on the benzoyl peroxide wash you use they can be drying and that can end up making the tretinoin even more irritating this one by cerave is quite good i'm sure the walgreens dupe is equally as good too earlier i pointed out how you don't want to put alpha hydroxy acids on the skin at the same time as tretinoin likewise you don't want to use a levon beta hydroxy acid otherwise known as salicylic acid at the same time so this product by cerave is a really good acne product but if you're using your tretinoin at night you wouldn't want to apply this at night along with it it can be very irritating instead provided your skin isn't overly irritated this would be one to maybe consider in the morning the key though with success with trenton owen is to just keep things very simple streamline and avoid the temptation to introduce a bunch of things especially in the beginning but overall just keeping it simple you may end up finding that that is really all you need you don't need to add a lot of additional acids here we have a sunless tanning product i'm holding this up because i want to let you guys know that if you use sunless tanner on the face while using tretinoin it's fine to do that but because tretinoin makes your skin a little bit more sensitive you may find that it is more irritating than it was before and because tretinoin kind of smoothes out the strut what's called the stratum corneum that's the part that's the part of the skin that the sunless tanner is kind of glomming onto because it smooths that out and thins it out the tan that you get with the sunless tanner the color it's not going to last as long as it once did likewise if you're using if you're using tretinoin to the body for stretch marks you may find that these kind of sunless tanning products that have dihydroxyacetone in them which is a safe ingredient you may find that the tan fades a lot more quickly all right let's talk about hair removal when you're using tretinoin this is something to be very careful about you don't want to do waxing actually because remember i said that tretinoin is going to smooth out that top layer of the skin that's normally part of what is pulled off when you get when you get facial waxing or any kind of waxing you're going to have less of that there and what can end up happening is you can develop little sores so if you're going to do waxing you kind of have to stop tretinoin for a while it's just a pain yeah you don't want to do waxing now shaving is fine you know you can do facial you can shave the face when you're using tretinoin but again it's smoothing out that top dead layer of the skin the stratum corneum and so you're going to be more vulnerable to razor burn irritation so be really careful with your shaving good shaving practices include making sure your blade is sharp don't use a dome blade use like a shaving cream shave in the direction of hair growth and don't press too hard that's a common reason why people get not only razor burn but it can then lead to ingrown hairs which is just going to make you miserable i wanted to come over here by the hand soaps to specifically make the point that after you apply treadmill onto your face wash your hands because the tretinoin on your fingers you later will end up inevitably touching around the delicate skin of the eyes and that can transfer the treadmill in there and be very irritating so make sure you wash your hands after you apply treadmill well guys i hope this video was helpful they had quite a few products in there that i think are great options if you're new to tretinoin or maybe you're using it and you're having a lot of irritation peeling hopefully these tips helped the best thing when it comes to really skin care in general but in having success with tretinoin and not getting too much skin irritation is just keep it simple and yeah don't you know try and introduce a lot of stuff protect your skin from the sun don't over complicate it and if you are having too much irritation you can always back down to using it every other day or a few times a week it will still be effective just takes longer to work but that way you have less irritation so i hope this video was helpful to you guys now on the end slate i'm going to put my most recent video explaining how to save a ton on prescription tretinoin so definitely check that out because it can get expensive if you're paying out of pocket for it for like wrinkles and fine lines so check that out but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe i'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

        "transcript": "good morning my little nerds i am dr shireen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city and welcome to your newest favorite youtube channel if you've never been here otherwise welcome back every saturday morning we do these videos between 10 a.m and 10 15 a.m where the videos on average last 15 minutes or so and we dive in to a topic de lessemen because i only do this once a week where do i get my topics from i actually get them from your questions i read through your comment sections even though i don't have time to answer every single one of them otherwise i would have carpal tunnel and i try to gather what people are really asking about what they're questioning what they want to learn more about so before we commence make sure that you've subscribed why not just like the video because you're probably gonna like it who are we kidding and then comment below okay because i really do want to see how best i can help you help yourself i actually do go deep into the comment section to understand what it is people are wondering about and if they're wondering about anything or nothing at all so maybe one day there will be no comments and we will be done so until that day comes i will keep on going so today my little nerds get your pens get your glasses get your notebooks ready because we are going to dive deep into the world of azelaic acid why azuleic acid because what's not to love about azoleic acid acelic acid is literally and i think i've compared this one in the past which is the most friendly sign of the zodiac [Music] most helpful and emotionally giving signs of the zodiac we're back to the zodiac with miss cleo and they're extremely helpful they want to over promise sometimes they under deliver and they are asleep acid is a sagittarius of the bunch now all fellow sagittariuses you guys are stubborn af my daughter is driving me nuts but she has a good heart and i see it and i acknowledge it not because she's my daughter but i do see it and i see it also my mom because they share the same birthday so it's not a dig at you you guys are annoying and stubborn but i love you because you give give give give give and so does azoleic acid so my rant on the horoscope is done your hour with cleo is over so let's dive in before we actually get into the nitty-gritty science i want to quickly talk history because like the best things in life this one was completely discovered serendipitously what does that even mean serendipity is still my favorite movie from the 90s or early 2000s but it happened halfhazardly and basically the human inquisitive mind led some scientists to really dig deeper when they noticed that people with tinnitus versus color that is a infection that happens on the skin which is caused by a yeast also known as malassezia fervor had these white hypo pigmented hypochromic patches on their skin and they scratched their heads and they thought to themselves why is this yeast whitening this person's skin and so they dug a little deeper and what they realize is that this particular yeast makes azelaic acid and by making azolic acid azolic acid actually works against tyrosinase what's tyrosinase tyrosinase is the enzyme that dictates how fast melanin is made so when you are infected with tinnitus versus color when you have that yeast malassezia on your skin and it's infecting your cells it's secreting azelaic acid which is inhibiting your melanin from being produced so when it's summertime and it's hot and it's sunny and you go to the beach and all of a sudden you notice white splotches on your chest or your back that yeast is producing the azolic acid that's blocking your skin from forming pigment crazy in the sun and it's even more visible and so the scientists were like whoa if this yeast can make this ingredient that now inhibits how pigment is produced what else can it help and that is how we discovered the medical usage of azaleic acid i find that story amazing because it was completely haphazard so before we get into the actual benefits that we have now discovered down the road after having used azolic acid in our repertoire for many years i also want to just quickly talk about the science it is a dicarboxylic acid like i said produced by malassezia fervor and it is also found in certain natural substances and grains like rye barley wheat and certain animal products fyi azolic acid is a distant relative to alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids when i say distant i'm talking like third degree or fourth degree cousin i don't even know if that's a thing but the word acid is really all they really have in common because azelaic acid is not an exfoliating acid unlike ahas and dhas also if you're super sensitive to an ah or bha don't be afraid of the azalea x okay um because they tend to have the best safety profile on the market if you are somebody who has very sensitive skin i would probably approach azelaic acid with more open arms than i would glycolic um i would test it out before i slather it all over my face like anything good in life you always test it before you marry it i hope so you know unless you went to vegas on one drunken night who knows but i would tell you test it out date it and then get married so maybe test it in front of your ear if you're super sensitive but i will say that if you are very very sensitive this is one of the ingredients that i have no problem prescribing to you so if that's of any reassurance then i hope i don't know what isn't okay i'm forgetting how to speak because it's been a long day what exactly now are the benefits of azolic acid well when i think of azelaic acid it is a multi-targeted drug it helps with many different things but before we jump in to the different categories know that azelaic acid targets cells that are hyperactive so any condition in which you have a hyperactivity of sorts inflammation so like acne and rosacea it can help minimize that inflammation any condition that has a hyper proliferation of pigment like that bi tch melasma that one i hate melasma with a vengeance i i with a passion like it just she drives me nuts metal as well um azelaic acid is going to target those pigment cells that are hyper producing pigmentation to help minimize it um even certain types of cancers like lentigon malignant azolic acid is more likely to help minimize the pigmentation in a lentigo malignant it doesn't mean it's curing it but it just means that it's a sign that it may actually be dangerous if it fades because of just the azoleic acid because they are hyper proliferative cells that pick up the azolic acid and make it work so let us start with number one acne and its antibacterial effects so again a little brief tiny history the antibacterial effects of azelaic acid were only discovered by the off-chance now once they were trying to treat melasma patients with it they noticed that people with melasma who were using azolic acid tended to have less breakouts and that's when they noticed that there was a connection with azelaic acid and acne and what they found was that azolic acid helps to kill p acnes which is rare because not that many ingredients killed that evil inducing acne bacteria and so they thought this is awesome we should just use this for acne and that's literally how azelaic acid came about for acne it was by chance and what they found was that the 20 solution of azelaic acid worked great and they even showed that it was even almost up to par with tretinoin when used longer term now what is the sweet spot for azelaic acid it's really between 10 and 20 percent however one study did show that at five percent when combined with two percent clindamycin which is an antibiotic you can get up to i think it was like 60 improvement of your acne so it's pretty potent not to be underestimated and not to take its kindness as weakness and number two regulates the production of skin cells especially in acne prone skin so people who have a lot of blackheads and clogged pores as like as your bff why because it blocks the way that your keratinocytes hyperdifferentiate and hyperproliferate and therefore it minimizes how much your pores get obstructed and blocked into forming blackheads and so it is a great adjunct if you have acne and blackheads i would definitely make sure to add azalea gas number three it is also great because of its anti-inflammatory effects it has been proven to have anti-inflammatory effects at 15 and that's usually what we prescribe and last and not least and the best one of all it's skin lightening effects number four now the interesting part about its skin lightening effect is that it has no activity actually on normal skin cells so it's not going to bleach you out but the hyperactive cells pick it up and by picking it up diarosinase gets blocked and gets minimized and your skin tone eventually becomes more even so like i said melasma lentigo malignant post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from having a lot of inflammation which i mentioned earlier azelaic acid helps suppress all of those conditions can get better with a little bit of the aaa in the game now some studies actually compare azolic acid to my my my creme de la creme hydroquinone at two and four percent but the reason i think i still prefer hydroquinone to azolic acid is because hydroquinone can still at least lighten age spots like solar lentigos like things that happen because of a lot of sun exposure in your youth when you were young and dumb and naive but azelaic acid will unfortunately not minimize the color of your quote unquote wisdom spots or age spots or sunspots it will only help in areas where you've had active inflammation or a hyperproliferation of pigmentation like melasma and with that said let's talk about formulation because this is what i find the most interesting and most intriguing so i have looked to formulate something with azolic acid because i think it is an ingredient that can be very beneficial but the problem with azelaic acid is that it is a powder and as a powder it works as a suspension and once that powder is mixed into the goop and the goop dries out on your skin it tends to mattify your skin and it can even pill because again it's a powder that now the liquid has evaporated around and the powder sits on top of your skin that doesn't mean it's not working it just means that it's cosmetically not elegant and so i think azelaic acid products are hard to stick to in a routine because they can be not so aspirational you know it doesn't really make your skin glow as much as you want it to glow it doesn't give you that instant gratification and not to mention the pilling can be quite annoying plus it has a little bit of a scent so when it comes to formulating acetolic acid if you notice that your product is pilling and you're getting a little bit of all of this like fuzz after you've applied it and you've allowed it to dry out no it's because azelaic acid is actually a powder and that it has it has evaporated and now the powder is sitting on your face so that's just something to keep in mind the ideal concentration is ten to twenty percent prescription usually starts at fifteen percent and goes up to twenty percent but again very interesting azelaic acid prescription at 15 gel has been shown to be more absorbent than the 20 cream and i think that is fascinating because the vehicle of the product is sometimes even more important than the concentration of the product and that's why i am not pro disclosing all the percentages of ingredients because i think it can confuse a consumer and it can work to your detriment now the only real ingredient where i think the percentage is absolutely necessary for in order for you to understand what you're getting it's retinols because you want to gauge how your skin responds to various levels of retinols and one day we will talk about that more in depth but for today azolic acid is between 10 and 20 percent the 15 gel has been shown to have an 8 higher absorption rate than the 20 cream so something for you guys to keep in mind so with that being said i first want to start with the prescription as you can see i use this guy quite a bit it is a gel but it looks like a light lotion okay and what i find fascinating actually about the azelaic acid 15 gel is that i've actually never had any issues with pilling from this one the way this particular prescription is formulated it works wonders on the skin on its own it can be very beautiful and i absolutely love this fifteen percent um azolic acid gel and i would strongly recommend that you get yourself a nice prescription of this because it's beautiful if you do not have access to your doctor or you just don't want to go see your doctor here are some over-the-counter options that i'm going to describe very briefly for all of you this one is by paula's choice it is a ten percent azoleic acid booster this one retails for 38 dollars as you guys can kind of see over here it does have a very nice texture but i will tell you it stinks it smells like chalk to be very frank so if you don't mind that scent then knock yourself out this is a great product they even offered me and i don't get any extra commission from this this is not a way for me to make extra money at all they are giving you guys this discount because they like that you guys like the products when i recommend it but it's dr idris d-r-i-d-r-i-s-s-15 for an additional 15 off i will link it below okay so you guys can get yourselves an additional 15 off and knock yourself out this saturday with paula's choice and you can stink in the process i do not like the smell of this uh but i use it on occasion now the ordinary has a ten percent as a leg acid suspension and this is their product this one retails for seven dollars and ninety cents i will show you it is thicker it also has a stink to it that the prescription does not have so this one is definitely thicker this one is the ten percent azelaic acid as it dries out i actually do want to show you guys it's interesting but do you see how one hand is matte and the other is not can you see that this is the hand in which i applied it and you could see everything looks matte whereas here it doesn't look as matte um and i have no moisturizer on the other hand so it definitely mattifies and i will tell you this one does pill so after a minute or two you get pilling it's to be expected like i said once it evaporates that product is just gonna sit on the surface of your skin and last dr sam bunting now she has formulated this one with a bunch of other actives this is her flawless brightly serum and i will tell you right now this contains water azolic acid niacinamide um there is a vitamin c in this uh there's bokuchil and that's pretty much what this contains um it is a nice one i do not know the percentage at which niacinamide is in this particular product so i cannot speak for it it doesn't stink as much as the rest but it is definitely mattifying once it dries out so if you are expecting a glow you will not get it with this however if you have melasma or hyperpigmentation from inflammation this is a great one to add on as well because you get a little bit of everything else in the process so with that i think azelaic acid is great for acne prone skin i think it is great for people with rosacea and underlying inflammation i also think it is great for darker skin tones that get breakouts to minimize how much hyperpigmentation is left behind and it is a no-brainer to add if you have melasma the only problem with melasma is i would recommend just getting a prescription added onto your routine because that is the most elegant way to add it to your routine without becoming a complete pill ball you see that do you guys see how it feels it's just the nature of the game oh i am completely flaking everywhere if i showed you guys oh my god look look look um it is completely a pill monster of an ingredient but definitely worthwhile having especially if you have melasma this is out of control i am completely pilling so to be expected when using an azelaic acid product not to freak out about if you can't tolerate it just get the prescription and stick to just using it at night because you're going to pass out and no one's really going to watch you at least you hope no one's watching you okay that's a little freaky on this saturday morning but happy saturday i'm dr shereen idris i hope you guys learned a thing or two please don't forget to like comment and subscribe i'll catch you guys next week have a great day [Music] you",
