        "transcript": "[Music] rosacea is a chronic skin condition the the condition itself often affects the face so it's highly highly visible rosacea is just one of those conditions that sits in the background really until something triggers a massive flare and then you can look completely different to the way you did just a few moments before and it's it really psychologically damaging actually you know it really does affect your confidence it can get very depressing especially if you're just about to go off to a special event and then you have a flower outfits it's it can be a bit debilitating the main sort of factors that seem to come out or social anxiety it takes a lot sometimes people to seek the help that that is available for them and there's a lot to be said for normalizing by which I mean hearing at accounts from other people feeling like you're not alone so the sorts of resources that talk health and sort of rosacea at building serves very good function in meeting that that need it's it's like everything in life isn't it it's nice to know that you've got the only person dealing with the problem that you have and to be able to share that with other people and I think is great you can find the information you believe you require in one place you can get an advice from experts or they can look at other people who are suffering we can often give more information and better advice than the experts because they know they've experienced it people should be inclusive and see their GP if they're you know if it's getting to the point that is having a significant dent on their quality of life or they're experiencing symptoms or low moods that we have difficulties with sleep loss of appetite having difficulty feeling pleasure and taking enjoyment from life there are very high levels of nervousness and so on and going to the GP the GP should be able to to get you some support with a either an increase in access to psychological therapies practitioner psychological well-being practitioner or beyond that get you to see a clinical psychologist or actually get you in to see the dermatologist just under the luckiest anything else can be done from the physical side of things [Music]",

        "transcript": "are you struggling with facial redness postural spots or just irritated skin keep watching to learn a holistic approach to rosacea on its treatment in today's video if you're new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret known may be considered it's a powerful retinoid medication that's often used to treat severe acne but it can also be effective in treating rosacea it's only prescribed in specialist centers if you have difficulty accessing and appropriately qualified medical professional there are online Dermatology Services who can assess your skin where you upload photographs and describe your symptoms a dermatologist then assesses your individual case and prepares a personalized blend of topical treatments suitable for your condition and your skin type I use dermatica for my own personalized night cream and contains a retinoid and a pigment reducer signing up with them at dermatica.com or demonica.co.uk and entering the code Dr Finbar on checkout means you'll get a 10 discount of any products that you purchase so rosacea can be a challenging condition to manage but by looking out for your emotional health make an appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments you can take control over your skin and enjoy a better quality of life if these methods alone don't get you the desired results have a look on their Monica's websites for personal treatment plans or visit an appropriately trained Healthcare professional don't let rosacea hold you back you deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your skin now if you found this video helpful watch this short video on how we can start start

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "transcript": "hey guys it's emmer so today's video is going to be a rosacea diaries so basically today i want to talk a little bit about things that having acne or rosacea have stopped you from doing and i think we've all had that time and place where we wanted to do something but we felt limited by what our skin was doing which honestly you know shouldn't be an issue we should be able to do whatever we want no matter what our skin is doing or anything else but i think there are times that those things limit us and so i just want to share a few of the things that i have felt over the years so first of all i hated swimming i didn't want to go swimming i didn't really want to go anywhere where i was wet and not necessarily because i didn't enjoy it but it's because i didn't want to not be able to wear makeup and i know there's makeup now that is considered waterproof that you could wear but i mean really who wants to wear makeup swimming i don't really want to wear makeup swimming so it just made me feel like if i was a teenager and i was at the pool and you know all your friends are meeting up there i'm like oh great if this such and such person sees me or if this boy that i think is cute sees me he's not going to like me when he sees what my face looks like which in all honesty wouldn't have been that huge of deal but it was still something i felt insecure about not being able to wear makeup another thing was working out in gym class i would wear makeup to gym because i'd wear makeup to school but it's like when i started exercising that creates a huge flush for me like if i am running or doing anything like that like my face will get so red and i remember i used to tease and be like oh here's my tomato face you know and i just remember hated doing the mile or running of any kind because my face would get so red which i'm sure other peoples did too it probably wasn't just me but i remember i had to teach in aerobics class we had to take turns it was our final project and i was working with three other girls and it was just like i was the whole time i'm sitting there thinking oh my goodness i'm getting so sweaty and my face looks so red and to me that was just like a huge deal um one thing that i haven't let me stop me as of recently is when i have breakouts or when my rosacea was really bad for those of you who kind of know this i stopped filming my youtube videos for a while because my rosacea got really really bad there are a few times that i filmed videos and i put like disclaimers like i know my skin looks really bad right now but i need to film anyway and i didn't really want to save the time that i was pregnant but i was and that's why i got so much of a flare up from my rosacea and acne but it's been nice that now there's times before i started using my clear proof that my skin really didn't look that great and i put my makeup on and i did some of my foundation routines and some of them i just film and it's like yeah i'm filming in 1080p like i don't leave a lot to the imagination when it comes to seeing my skin up close but you know what i'm okay with that because what i realized is it's not just me a lot of other people struggle with this and it's okay and i think so many times you see these girls on the camera and they all have perfect skin and it's just like well that would be nice to have perfect skin and i know how that feels because i feel that way too i wish i could just come on here and my skin was just all the same and didn't have any redness to it but it doesn't but that's okay it's okay that i have this because a lot of other people have it too so i have just still posted videos even though i might have been struggling with my skin and when my skin started clearing up you know i got comments so really nice that we're like your skin's looking so much better and you know that kind of thing and it was such a nice supportive way it wasn't like uh oh man your skin looked horrible it was like you guys were so supportive and um kind of sharing in my happiness of having clear skin and when i posted those videos i didn't get a ton of people posting like oh my gosh your skin's so horrible you're so ugly why are you doing this and those could have been my fears in the past and i just realized that so many other people struggle with this that i'm not just alone and i think that really helps when you're struggling with this kind of thing to realize that you're not alone you're not the only person who struggles with this you might be the only person in your group of friends or the only person in your family or your only person in your town it might feel like but really there are a lot of people that struggle with this and that's kind of why i want to do this rosacea diaries thing on my channel just to show the real raw ways that having rosacea and acne can affect you and i think it can even affect you a little bit deeper and affect just kind of yourself worth in general and you might not feel like you can do things because you don't feel as beautiful as somebody else or you might feel like well if it was between me and her then they're gonna pick her or if your guy you know that girl's not gonna like me because i've got this or that going on and the truth is is that that doesn't affect who you are and you might have acne but you are not acne and you might have rosacea but you're not rosacea and i'm amber and i do so many other things that don't even have to do with my skin but i have rosacea and that's okay because that doesn't not define who i am as a person it is the does not define what i'm capable of and if you are struggling with these things it doesn't define you either and so that's kind of what i want to talk about today if you have um any stories you'd like to share about um you know things that you've kind of overcome with your acne or rosacea i'd love to hear about it you can leave me a comment down below and if you have any topics um kind of around acne and realization that you'd like to talk about or you want me to touch on i would be happy to do so i hope this is helpful for you guys and i hope you can realize that you are beautiful and you're awesome and i'll see you guys later bye",

        "transcript": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back to the fem Health Channel today we have Dr Kira bar she is a board certified dermatologist practicing in Washington state today we're going to talk to her about how rosacea is affected by emotional distress hi Dr bar thanks for being here first of all can you tell me a little bit about what rosacea is yeah rosacea is an inflammatory condition and there's several different variants of it um some people experience papules and pules more like an acne form eruption some experience more redness and irritation and then others there's more of a dilated blood vessels some it's a it's a combination of all the above but it's an inflammatory skin condition is it affected more in one age group or a certain population it seems that women tend to be affected more so but there are many men that are affected by rosacea as well and the challenge with rosacea is not only does it affect the skin surface but some people it does affect their eyes and so it can be um a very challenging uh to live with from a physical standpoint but also from the mental emotional impact that it has because it's so it can be so visible when it flares does it tend to be painful as well some people do share that there's itching there's burning there's irritation and discomfort yes so talk to me a little bit about how emotional distress stress in general can affect patients who have rosacea yeah I think just in general there's so much literature and research we know you know the the mind and skin are intimately connected they're derived from the same layer of embryologic tissue they're communicating with each other all the time so it's no surprise that what shows up on our skin can affect our mood and our mood can affect what shows up on our skin and there are so many individuals women in particular who said that their condition has caused embarrassment and emotional distress low self-esteem causing them to avoid social situations really having an impact on their quality of life and all of these factors can also contribute to anxiety and depression in fact there was um recent study I think it was done by the rosacea Society in fact they did a study of 602 patients and 88% of the survey respondents said that their rosacea flares up when they're under emotional stress it's totally understandable right we live in a society that puts so much weight and value on our physical appearance attribute our worthiness to our physical appearance which it really can suck sometimes it really can do you find that some Ros patients are also being concurrently treated for anxiety or stress and it kind of becomes this vicious cycle at all where the Versace is actually causing the anxiety and the anx anxiety is causing the rosacea so I think you know it it is can be a vicious cycle and the challenge is most patients are just having the service symptoms addressed and they're not being supported with how their skin condition is impacting their life their their and and their emotional well-being we know that that stress in all its forms increases our primary stress hormone cortisol and cortisol directly impacts our skin it increases serum sebum uh production which contributes to those papules and pules it also increases inflammation activation of that Sur sympathetic uh nervous system that triggers those blood vessels to react causing the redness the flushing the Vaso dilation um causes Skin Barrier breakdown and we also know that the stress response decreases gut motility right because our body is not prioritizing eating when we're stressed and we know that decreased gut motility can contribute to disbiosis and there is a strong correlation between the gut and the skin right that gut skin axis so for those reasons we know that when we're stressed it's going to have a direct impact on the skin for all of those reasons so then you see the the result the flush ing the the pules that creates stress and it be and it just goes round and round and then there's fear and anxiety and worried like what am I going to do how am I going to get out of my house and it just it's awful so what do we do about it number one I do it's this is this is a both end situation we need to support people with the medication side to kind of calm things down a bit but really from my perspective and the work that I do is really focusing on on how do we manage that chronic stress how do we help support the anxiety and the distress that is triggering the condition as well as resulting from through breath work through mindfulness through a somatic process right what is it feel like what would it feel like to feel more calm ease and comfort in your skin and there are so many different ways that we can do that and I can tell you when we do that work it's a game Cher I work primarily with women but they have said I have never felt so calm even if their skin isn't completely clear they are learning how to live with a chronic skin condition right they're learning to feel more comfort and confidence in themselves regardless of what Society is telling them how they should act and look because here's the thing what's showing up on your skin even though society would have us believe that it needs to be camouflaged or covered up or somehow you're broken It's actually an invitation it's an invitation what showing up in your skin is an invitation to get really curious about what's happening beneath the surface it invites us to take control of the things that we can control part of that control might be going to your dermatologist and getting the help and support but often times it's who am I spending my time with am I on my phone up until the we hours of the night and not prioritizing my sleep do I not have boundaries am I saying yes to things that I don't want to all of these things impact that mind skin connection and it shows up on the surface of your skin so I would invite everyone to consider that what's showing up on their skin is actually um a powerful invitation to take better care of yourself yeah that makes a lot of sense I'm sure it also applies to so many other skin conditions as well Dr bars was super helpful thank you so much for joining us and sharing your [Music] insights",

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": "if you are somebody who is suffering from rosacea right now and you have been to numerous doctors who told you that rosacea is incurable and then the only thing you can do is to try avoiding triggers in order to manage your redness forget all about this what I want you to hear right now is that rosacea is possible to be cured and you can feel like yourself again and you can have your healthy and normal and happy life back I'm somebody who had rosacea for 10 years years of my life I had my rosacea since I was 18 Till I was 28 and now I'm 29 and I didn't have any rosacea flare up for a year already these are my before and afters and I know that my skin doesn't look like a perfect photoshopped super model skin at the moment but oh my God I couldn't be in a happier place right now with the way my skin looks at the moment my skin feels so healthy and glowy to me right now comparing to what it had been during the last 10 years and today I'm going to share with you what exactly I did in order to get this skin and I'm also going to share with you all of the things that they say are supposed to help you with rosacea but they didn't do anything for me let's go welcome back my friends if if you're new on this channel my name is Anna and here I talk about beauty style and everything that can make us love our life a little bit more and please support my channel by clicking the like button down below this really helps me grow my audience and grow my channel and create more videos like this one for you and subscribe if you haven't yet of course thank you so much let's get back to our topic of rosacea and before you start your rosacea Journey please make sure that what you have is actually rosacea any dermatologist will be able to diagnose it for you we can never know why we get rosacea and we can never find out the exact reasons why rosacea starts and I don't have anybody in my family who has ever had rosacea that's why nobody could really tell me what I have and how I can get better I was feeling really miserable during the last 5 years especially the way rosacea looked for me is that I was getting redness on my face it was focused on my cheeks in this area and on my chin uh during the last two years of my rosacea I also started having it on my nose and on my forehead in here and uh it was not only redness it was also pimples like breakouts that I would cut and those pimples they were so stubborn it it's not like a normal tiny pimple that you can just squeeze out and then it's going to be healed after 2 days that is something that if you try to squeeze it nothing will change about it it will stay so there is no point of trying to do anything to it and actually I had some pimples that stayed on my face for years like for a year at least that's for sure like it didn't go away it didn't get any smaller it didn't get any bigger nothing changed about it and I was just living with those things on my face and I know how Rosa can make you feel it can make you feel like you hate your skin and you hate yourself and that's what happened to me I got to the point where I was hating myself for not doing enough for not being strong enough to deal with this problem and I would hate the fact that I felt like I had to wear makeup to just leave my house I had to wear makeup all the time because when I was not wearing my makeup I felt like I looked like a monster and that I felt embarrassed of my bare skin and the only times when I would leave my house without any makeup was to go to see a new doctor and when I was going to see a new doctor I would go without makeup and I would want this doctor to see my bare skin I would want him to see how bad it is for me and how I'm suffering uffing and I thought that this could actually make him realize that I need help and the feeling of visiting a new doctor every time was so it was hard because every time you go to a new one you are full of hope you think maybe this time it's going to be it maybe this time it's going to be a person who's going to help me and I'm finally going to be cured but the disappoint man every time after it doesn't work it was tremendous and it was so painful when you when you go out there like I remember one time I was seeing this lady and I came to her office I showed her my skin I showed her pictures of how terrible my skin looks on some days and I was I was feeling so embarrassed of of myself of my skin and everything that she said to me is that Rosa is incurable you can you can't do anything about it you can try cantra but really nothing can be done so just goodbye that was that was the moment that I've had enough and I decided that I'm going to do more and that I'm going to finally take Serious steps and deal with it so I think I've had enough talking let's get actually to the things that they say are supposed to help you but they didn't help me at all and in the end I will say what helped me in fact among of the things that doctors say are supposed to help you with rosace is dieting and avoiding certain types of food and drinks and I've tried them all I've tried not drinking alcohol not drinking coffee caffeine not drinking coffee and alcohol at the same time not eating any red fruits or vegetables not eating anything red like ketchup as well and like tomato paste anything red it was a no no for me not eating gluten not eating sugar not eating diary products I had a phases when I had to avoid all of these products completely and all of these efforts brought me nothing with dieting out of the way we are moving to probiotics and vitamins I try taking probiotics vitamins different ones didn't do a thing for me next thing is uh skincare products for rosacea skincare products which are supposed to help with rosacea are not actually helping you cure rosacea what they can do is that they can help you kind of sooth and calm down your breakouts a little bit maybe dry them out a little bit but they never really helped me deal with my breakouts completely and what skincare uh products definitely don't do is that they don't prevent new breakouts from coming so new breakouts uh and new flare ups happen anyway doesn't matter what kind of uh like gentle skin care or expensive skincare products you use but uh bad skincare products can actually make you feel worse so really be careful with the skin care that you use if you have rosace I think I will do a separate video with skincare products that I used during my rosacea years and some of them I still use right now another thing that you supposed to avoid with rosacea is sun and heat and I used sunscreen every single day and it didn't improve my situation with rosacea at all another product which I'm sure you've heard of if you have been with Rosa for quite some time already is a magic cream called santra santra is a prescription uh cream which has an active ingredient which is called E vertine and usually doctors say that that is the only rosacea treatment that can actually help you and I had enormous hopes for this cream and they say You're supposed to use it for months before you start seeing results and I've used it every single day I've used it for 3 months for 6 months for 7 months and after 9 months I I understood that I'm not having any results with cantra zero results happened for me with cantra I also tried rosex rosex cream is another prescription cream which has an active ingredient called metronidazol and I've used it at the same time as cantra I used it for 6 months not for 9 months because uh I really felt bad about this cream it is really greasy it is heavy and I felt really really bad while using it I felt like my skin was getting greasy and I felt like my breakouts are even getting bigger and I felt like I was getting more breakouts with this cream so I really didn't like the rosex cream but I kept on using it for six months I used it every night and I used and I use cantra every morning and I didn't get any results with this cre creams also I have done numerous uh blood tests I was testing my health I was trying to find out what's wrong with me I also had a sio test sibo test is a kind of a Brea breathing test uh which is concerning your gut health you are supposed to be prepared for this test like you don't eat anything but chicken with olive oil and drinking water for 2 days which was super complicated and then you're breathing for 4 hours into a special tube and then you get your results uh the full name of this test is a small intestinal bacterial over growth test and well really lots of people don't get perfect perfect results from this test so after taking this test a doctor prescribed me xifaxan xifaxan is a local antibiotic for your gut health and I've been taking xifaxan for about a month and I have seen a little bit of result after taking Caan on my face and I was quite happy about it and I felt like I was on the right track but after stopping cakan everything came back my Rosia came back fully and that was the moment that that I understood that taking antibiotics might actually be a right direction for me and I've researched the topic a lot and what I've read is that in the USA and in Europe there is um medication that is helping with rosacea and it is called orasa or eesh IA here in Europe they have different names in Europe and in the United States I managed to find a doctor who agreed with me that it's a good idea for me to take the direction of taking antibiotics EPA the way it is called here in Europe has an active ingredient of doxy it has 40 milligrams of doxy doxy is quite a strong antibiotic but 40 milligrams is not that much and what you are supposed to do is that you take eia for 3 months every single day and while this might sound scary for you antibiotics for 3 months I would say it was 100% worth it for me and I was so happy that I decided to take it the way you are supposed to take acia is you take it in the morning on an empty stomach and then you wait for 1 hour before you have breakfast that was a good schedule for me I was happy to have an 1 hour of free time before breakfast and I didn't experience any side effects with ephestia at all I felt fine the whole time my God Health was fine the whole time I was taking prebiotics and probiotics during taking aphria and after taking EPA for some time and generally I didn't experience anything bad about this about this about epia and I started seeing the results after one month and a half I started seeing that my breakouts started going away and after finishing acia I had uh like I think like two pimples on my face which was close to nothing I was beyond happy and two months after starting after stopping ecia I had zero break breakouts my face was completely clear and I read a lot online that people often get their Rosa back after stopping EPA or orasa but that didn't happen to me I didn't get any rosacea flare ups or any rosacea breakouts during the last year after I stopped aesia my skin I as I've already said is is far from perfect but I'm so happy with the way it is and I try to stick to a healthy diet I try to eat as many vegetables and fruits as possible although I know I'm far from perfect I eat meat and fish and I drink coffee each day and uh I drink alcohol really rarely but sometimes I do in small quantities I eat sugar and I eat gluten and I eat diary products and that doesn't make my skin feel any worse sometimes I know when I'm eating like a big birthday cake full of cream I know that I might get a tiny pimple the next day but that pimple does not look like the rosacea breakouts that I used to have it looks like you know a tiny little pimple that goes away after one day or two days so that that doesn't resemble rosacea breakouts at all after about 3 months after stopping etia I had three sessions of lumenis M22 treatment it is an IPL therapy intense pulse light therapy they also call it a photofacial and this treatment is supposed to improve your skin color and skin texture and that was exactly what I needed after 10 years of rosacea my skin was a little bit treed in some places the texture was not perfect I had enlarged pores and three sessions of IPL helped me really a lot I don't feel like I need to do any other sessions I don't feel like I need to do anything else to my skin I'm just going to continue with the skincare routine that I have right now and I couldn't be in a happier place than I am right now I really hope that this video was helpful for you please click the

        "description": "Rosacea affects more than 2 million Canadian adults, and there can be significant emotional and social effects for sufferers.",
        "published_at": "2015-04-10T19:16:13Z",
        "transcript": "you're listening to what she said on Canada talks welcome back I'm Christine Bentley in studio with Kate wheeler and I'm not sure if you're aware of this but it's rosacea awareness month and there are two million Canadians and it's a staggering number of people affected by rosacea and we have uh an expert with us Kate Dr Ben barrancan from the Toronto dermatology center is here to talk about it now you're you're a spokesman for the there's a of rosacea's society an awareness group the acne and rosacea Society of Canada so tell us a little bit about rosacea because it's fairly common apparently it is indeed common uh it's a chronic condition uh typically affects adults 30 to 50 years of age although other ages can be affected very common in certain ethnic groups so particularly the Celtic population the northern Europeans as well both men and women are affected but women more commonly and there's often a family history of this condition and patients typically have a variety of signs and symptoms including redness burst blood vessels sensitive skin easy flushing pimples and pustules and this can go on for years and years so how would it be different from eczema let's say or eczema I never know I mean it's sort of tomato tomato I I'm never sure how to pronounce it but sure eczema is another very common condition and you know eczema is a little different it doesn't have the pimples and pustures so it doesn't have the acne-like features uh people with eczema typically have itchy skin dry sensitive skin worse in Winter also can be hereditary but quite different and sometimes we need a dermatologist to help make the diagnosis whether it's acne or rosacea or some other skin condition but I mean I think one of the one of the points is that know the symptoms so they're are you saying that there are many people walking around with rosacea or some some level of rosacea and they're not aware of it probably most people actually with rosacea are not aware that they have what do they think they have um I think you know many of them have had redness and easy flushing sensitive skin formation just think they blush easily exactly and they were just told that's your skin type you're very fair and in fact the number of them have rosacea undiagnosed and and that can be an issue you know not just cosmetically but there are associations with rosacea such as eye problems really what what what are problems so about 50 of people with rosacea have or will develop eye involvement and that can mean irritated dry eyes grittiness in the eyes frequent styes um even things like conjunctivitis and rarely blindness okay the other thing that I was really stunned and of course it makes sense when you think about it are that there can be significant emotional effects um you know up to and including depression absolutely liberalization absolutely connect you know in fact with every skin condition there's an elevated risk of mental health issues and that's because you know you wear your problem on your skin everyone can see it you can't hide it so in fact people with rosacea have five times the risk of depression of the regular population it's a huge difference and 75 percent of patients with rosacea report low self-esteem so you know you're walking around as an adult and you know you still have acne it's you know it's one thing as a teenager when you walk around with acne and 85 to 90 percent of your cohort has acne but as an adult to be walking around with acne and persistent redness it's it's quite bothersome it's embarrassing you can affect your workplace your dating it has a lot of impact so let's talk about the causes and the cures so first the cause is it's somewhat hereditary but I mean is it is it has it got anything to do with foods you eat or sleep or stress or what what what what would AG what would cause it or aggravate it sure so I think you know generally you have people that are predisposed genetically the someone in their family had it they come from a certain background right generally they're going to be fair skinned so Celtic or northern European as I said and there are things that trigger it that make it worse than flare it so hot and spicy foods for example uh really hot showers alcohol particularly red wine stress wind chocolate I'm gonna really start to cry definitely not chocolate we don't want you crying on air and really anything that increases your core body temperature can aggravate it um um it causes you to flush more so it causes your blood vessels to dilate okay okay so then let me ask you if flushing can do that is there any connection to the to menopause I mean you because one is personally experiencing lots of hot flushes these days and I am from England and I have very fair skin but I don't have that that redness actually I'm sort of glad I have fair skin because I actually have Vitiligo so that doesn't show up as much as it would on somebody with darker skin but um but you know so how can you is there a correlation between that kind of core temperature change no there isn't so wow you can have menopausal flushing and that's that could be totally separate from the flushing of rosacea so it's not hormonally linked it does not appear to be hormonally linked there are a few patients that say that it does flare with their periods but generally speaking it's not considered well I'm just wondering because you said it's primarily most predominant from the age of 30 to 50 and we hear that women especially if they and they seem to be more affected than men go through big hormonal changes you know sort of 30 40 50. so I it's you know why that age then uh we're not sure why that age and we do know for example that acne often has a hormonal element in women and in in some of those cases we can treat them with the oral contraceptive pill and that can make a significant difference to their acne whereas doing the same in a in a person with rosacea doesn't seem to have the same impact so the hormonal influence is not as important as it is in acne so Dr Brian can then what are some of there is no cure as I understand it but there are some treatments indeed there is no cure there's certainly a lot of research going on in rosacea because it is such a common problem and very bothersome to a lot of people there's a variety of treatment options so historically we've used various topical creams such as topical metronidazole which is a form of an antibiotic and that can be very helpful particularly for people with the pimples and pustules of rosacea and it's important to clarify that there's really two main types of rosacea there's the the one that's similar to acne where there's papules and pustules and then there's another type where it's more redness it's persistent burst blood vessels and easy flushing there are also as I said ocular rosacea or eye involvement rosacea and sometimes you can even have swelling of your tissues such as your nose what we call rhinophyma more commonly in men those are other rosacea variants so back to the treatments there's the topical antibiotics like metronidazole we've used oral antibiotics as well typically in the tetracycline family and they work more in their anti-inflammatory aspect as opposed to their antibiotic effects um but you're still taking them so I'm worried about you know building up a resistance we often hear about that so yeah that's actually a very good point and antibiotic resistance is is becoming a really major issue um so typically we've treated people for two or three months to get things under control uh with their skin and then go back to topical therapy that said uh there are newer oral agents that are more anti-inflammatory than antibiotics so they're safer what we call sub antimicrobial antibiotics there's a new gel they came out that really helps with that redness and flushing we do a lot of laser work as well at our clinic and other Physicians to treat that persistent redness the burst blood vessels the easy flushing and there should be a new cream coming in the next six months or so which seems to have terrific data and that will have a huge impact on rosacea so there's always new developments we've had a couple new treatments in the last two years and there's a couple more coming down pipeline that look very impressive well that sounds amazing now um there is a website where people can and can go to find out more information but the yes that's right so um there's a website rosaceahelp.ca and that's information from the acne and rosacea Society of Canada which was uh developed all the content by dermatologists from across Canada so the information is scientific and relevant and important and it's for the Canadian public and hey and hey you're also on Facebook book page yeah that makes things easy when you're uh when you cool around things so I mean it's important to to know there I would assume that there are questions on this site to help you determine if what you have is in fact rosacea absolutely so yeah you can get guidance through the website to determine if you have rosacea what type of rosacea and what you can start doing as far as trigger avoidance and minimizing flare-ups and who you should see and what sort of things you should do to manage your skin and prevent flare-ups well it's very encouraging to hear that we've had new treatments coming out the last couple of years and another great one coming out in the next six months so

        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi Rosie friends its Julie I'm back and I'm making videos again and I couldn't be happier I have missed this so much I have been working on the third book for my novel series and it's out on Halloween so it is really French time right now and I have been really busy but it's a good busy so it's been worth it but it has meant that I have not made a video in quite some time thank you very much for sticking with me and for your patience that's it it has had me thinking about a topic that I've wanted to discuss for some time now it's one that I haven't really known how I want to approach it I've kind of been having a hard time getting my mind around it so to speak as you can see from the video title I am finally covering the topic of rosacea stress and mental health and when I say mental health I mean all sorts of different kinds of issues not just the ones that I currently experience there is a huge amount to unpack here so I thought instead of trying to make one unbelievably long and horribly inadequate video I would try and break it down into a multi-part series I'm thinking it's probably gonna be three parts long at the moment but I am going to ask for your help here if you have any subjects in terms of rosacea and mental health rosacea and stress anxiety depression any of that kind of thing I would love it if you would leave a comment I will see what I can do if I know anything about it or have experienced it myself then I will be happy to talk about it that said I do think that it's really important to point out here that I am not a doctor I'm not a counselor I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist or any of those things when I mean talk about it I just mean as a discussion in terms of what I know what I've experienced and what I've read about on various sites that I trust like rosacea or the National rosacea Society and the Mayo Clinic and and other really well reputed sites in addition to actual studies that I've read too because I like to read medical studies because who doesn't like that well that being said I'm not here to diagnose you I'm not here to give you recommendations as to what you should do if you think that you have rosacea or that you know that you have rosacea or you think or know that you have some sort of mental health or physical health issue and you are looking for diagnoses or advice I really strongly recommend that you speak with a doctor they are the ones who can actually help you out I'm just a patient myself just like you I may look up a lot of stuff and ask a lot of questions to various experts and doctors and things but that does not make me an expert myself for this first video what I'm going to talk about is basically sharing a little bit of my own experience and a few basics in terms of some of the concepts that I'm gonna be discussing things like that I just want to get into why I'm interested in this particular subject and how it affects me and then we can expand on it in parts two and three in terms of how it kind of affects all of us who have rosacea and who are affected by things like stress and anxiety as a trigger and as a symptom of our condition okay so to get started I wanted to actually talk about stress itself and what I'm going to mean by stress because stress can come in good and bad forms not all stress is bad some stress is actually necessary and is healthy that said a lot of kinds of stress good and bad can affect our rosacea so I thought I would actually discuss stress as a concept at its very most basic level just so that we'd know when we're talking about stress in later videos what I'm actually referring to so the first kind of stress is the most basic ground-level kind of stress and that would be the type where you feel that you are in immediate usually physical danger this is the stress is the one that you get from your reptilian brain it's the one that is the fight-or-flight response it is built indoor very physical very primal they're part of the original part of our brain that has ever developed and it is what gives us the ability to respond quickly and to think quickly and to be suddenly more alert and to have a physical boost so that we can either fight to save our lives or run to get away if you've ever yourself or if you've seen a video or anything like that of somebody who has almost been hit by a car and they've left right over of the hood or they've seen something happen and have suddenly had this almost superpower to lift something they wouldn't normally be able to lift then that's usually because of this response your body suddenly is flooded with adrenaline and that just pumps you full of energy so that you can give yourself the best chance at getting away and living to see another day so that is really unscientific but that is the most sort of basic level of what that one's all about so the first type of stress is just that fight-or-flight you feel you're an immediate physical danger and this is what helps you get away the next type of stress is the one where you want to perform at your very best you have a job interview you have an important presentation you are playing on a sports team and this is the game something else that is just life defining and you need to make a good impression or perform at your very best this stress is the one that can help you again to have better mental and physical capacity so that you can push through and perform at your very best interestingly this dress is actually based on that same original stress the one that you felt from in the previous kind where your life was in danger it is still the fight-or-flight response it just happens to be because you think that this particular goal is so important that you're having the same reaction it is a it is life or death that's how important this is to you so your body and your stress respond in the same way in those first two situations stress that you feel might not be comfortable you get that you know bracing heart you were breathing fast or your hands might be shaky that kind of thing but at the same time it's helpful it helps you to get away from a dangerous situation and it helps you to perform at your best in a situation that you feel it's really really important but there are also forms of stress that are not helpful and that is normally a chronic type of stress so you live a very very stressful lifestyle a job that has you on-call 24 hours and you just never know exactly how something very important is going to work out there could be you could have just received medical news that is long term that is something that you didn't want to hear it could be that you're going through a very uncomfortable transition in your life or a positive transition one that you're just really unsure about the income and you have a lot of worries that kind of thing when you have that kind of chronic stress that type of thing can be damaging because when stress is just constantly there day and night and it never goes away it doesn't give your body the chance to come down from that really excited state so it doesn't have the chance to relax and it doesn't have the chance to recover as well as it can there are a lot of processes that go on that are very very hard on the body and on the mind for that matter and finally there's kind of a positive type of stress if you want to call it that and that's the type of stress that you feel that's actually a very good but powerful sensation it's an excitement you've won a prize you got the job or the promotion you wanted you got really great news of some kind as much as those are all very very positive things they all actually create this very similar type of response in the body you know something really fantastic happens you still you get the increased heart rate you get the increased respiratory rate your hands might still shake you know if you if you learn something absolutely fantastic it still can give you that same rush if you experience stress as a trigger like I experience stress is a trigger absolutely any one of those kinds of stress can actually create a rosacea response whether good or bad whether I am upset and blushing because I've been embarrassed or I've just been scared or I've I'm going through something traumatic or I just had something really fantastic happen one of my risk first responses to have a flushed face and that could last for a few minutes or it could last for quite a long time in my case I know that things are exaggerated I do have a number of mental disorders if you have been watching my videos for a while then you know that I suffer from several different kinds of mental health condition and each of those can actually contribute to worsening my rosacea symptoms as well at the same time rosacea can also play a role in worsening my mental health conditions depending on how well my skin is doing it and how comfortable it is at a certain given time for those of you who haven't been watching my channel for a while I suffer from social anxiety disorder generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder obsessive thoughts and I am also prone to periods of depression so it's a lot of fun being me and it's a lot of fun being around me at the same time I was first diagnosed when I was 19 years old with my first condition which was social anxiety disorder as it turns out I've probably had that since my early childhood but that was the first diagnosis that I actually received and that was the first time that I started receiving any kind of treatment I hadn't even heard of social anxiety disorder before that point my sister just happened to hear a show about it on the radio and came home and told me that I sounded exactly like that and I went to see the doctor and it turned out he agreed over the years to try to manage this I have taken a lot of different kinds of medication and have tried lots of different kinds of therapies I've taken antidepressants including zoloft which was a little yellow and white capsule I've taken paxil which is this little pink eye here I have taken beta blockers which look like this and they are what I was given along I think I was given that one along with zoloft because their zoloft didn't control my racing heart and it felt like I was having a heart attack and I was fainting from that so I got those pills for that one and then later on when that wasn't enough I got these really tiny little things here and those are ativan and those are something that I would stick under my tongue wait for it to dissolve and that would clear up a panic attack these are all very old pills and I didn't even know that I had them but I discovered them the other day and I am returning those as well as some expired anti lrg pills and my old contact lenses that I don't wear anymore to the pharmacist so don't worry I am NOT hanging on to these for any disease and to get rid of them at the pharmacist properly I said I did break them out just cuz I thought it might provide a cool visual to show that yes I have been on a lot of medications to try to control all of my everything going on in my head I took these in various dosages and combinations over the years throughout the time that I was on these different medications I worked really hard to be able to try to control the symptoms on my own until I finally was ready to wean myself off of them and I do mean weaning myself off these drugs because they are highly addictive and I was definitely stuck on them when I was trying to even when I was just gradually reducing the dose according to my doctor's instructions I was getting withdrawal symptoms like electric shocks in my teeth and hand so that was not fun nor was the feeling of having like a nail pounded into the top of my head during the night so these are definitely very serious medications they definitely helped me but they should not be taken lightly I'm not taking anything now I'm feeling very proud of that I don't think that anybody who is taking these types of assistance to get through their struggles should think less of themselves I took them for nine years and I don't know how it would have gotten through that time without the added help the symptoms that I was experiencing were very very strong and I don't know how I wouldn't have ended up basically as a shut-in if I hadn't had that extra help so that would reduce my symptoms while I was learning to cope with them on my own that's it I have far from mastered doping I have improved it definitely I am still trying different things all I can do is try to be very very aware of my symptoms and to my responses to my symptoms to try to make sure that I'm always having the healthiest reaction that I can manage I still have a lot of triggers for my anxiety and especially for the panic the main ones are things like talking on the phone I do have a phone but I do not have a ringtone for the voice calls because I won't answer it anyway I'm just not quite there yet I am trying to build up to phone calls but there are about four people in the world that I'm comfortable talking on the phone with the top challenge is with invasive thoughts well I am able to leave my home and go to the store and go shopping and meet people and I even do attend events with my co-author promote my book I still know that when I do a lot of these things and I have appointments and things like that I probably won't sleep the night before and I may or may not sleep the night afterward because my thoughts are stopping me they're constantly telling me things like shouldn't have said something or I've probably offended somebody they don't like me anymore because of that and I've hurt somebody's feelings that I set a joke that just wasn't funny and now they think they don't respect me anymore I know that these thoughts are ridiculous consciously rationally I know that no single thing that I say in passing that is small and light is going to be taken that seriously nobody thinks that the things that I say are that important but that doesn't seem to stop my brain at all and that stops me from sleeping insomnia goes hand-in-hand with that and then when I don't sleep both my rosacea and my invasive thoughts get worse if you want me to talk any more about any of the topics those topics my triggers my anxiety my individual conditions any of that kind of stuff I will happily do that in another video please request that in the comments but I know that I'm digressing right now from the rosacea a little bit and I'd kind of like to stay on track for the series I will be much more focused in parts two and three I'm just trying to create a foundation so you'll understand where I'm coming from though the whole point to all this is that stress and anxiety and depression and rosacea are all linked in a lot of ways fortunately they do create a kind of vicious cycle among a lot of us I know that this is how I experience it I know that I have been talking to a lot of you over email and over direct messages over to my different social media accounts and you've talked about this quite a lot about the anxiety that you feel from your rosacea and that it's making your fascia worse or the other way around that you feel anxiety and then it brings out your rosacea I feel at least in my case that it goes both ways one of them just feeds off the other and it gets worse and worse and worse and it's easy to get caught up in it this a common way for one of the cycles to start up for me is that I will have a flare-up from whatever it might be I've eaten something funny I've had something embarrassing happen and I blush and it just triggers the whole thing I went out in the Sun and didn't realize I would be out there for so long and it sets it off whatever it happens to be I end up with a flare-up that brings with it redness stinging burning itching bumps and all those fun symptoms that we tend to go through because of that I feel more stressed I'm uncomfortable I feel ugly I feel like other people can see it happening and especially because when I blush I blush when I'm embarrassed but then it doesn't go away so people think that I'm still upset even if I'm not and I blush a really easily it doesn't take a lot of embarrassment it just takes like and that's it then my face will flare up so as soon as I start to feel even the slightest bit stressed or embarrassed then I flush even more so any of those original symptoms will get worse and as those symptoms get worse I'm aware of them I'm more uncomfortable and I feel more stress and that just keeps building and then I become uncomfortable enough that I don't sleep very well at night I end up lying awake listening to my invasive thoughts the next day I'm less capable of coping with stress because I'm not well rested and I've been torturing myself for the last 10 hours or whatever however long I wasn't lying in bed trying to sleep and because of that it just gets worse my symptoms get worse my face keeps flushing it keeps being itchy and uncomfortable I feel ugly and so on and so on and so on so as you can see once you get into the cycle of bouncing your rosacea symptoms and your stress or anxiety off each other it's really difficult to crack your way out and it sounds like it should be easy it sounds like you should tell yourself to just calm down get over it it's not that bad it'll pass all of those things but when you're in it it's not that easy if you've ever been really upset about something you can't just tell yourself not to be sad anymore or not to be afraid and the same thing goes with stress you can't just say well I'm not gonna be stressed anymore and then it's gone because you can't lift just lift that away super easily get the the rosacea symptoms tend to stick around um as a side note I recently read a book called Turtles all the way down by John Green he's a fantastic author he is a fantastic youtuber I really have a lot of respect for him it's a fiction novel and the main character has absolutely nothing in common with me except that she has invasive thoughts and her invasive thoughts are nothing like my invasive thoughts but he has absolutely nailed the description on what it feels like to constantly be arguing with your brain you feel like you're actually under attack by somebody else who just happens to also be you and so if you are ever if you experience this and you'd love to read about that experience or if you know somebody else and you would like to know what they're going through he has done a fantastic job it's a really good book all by itself but he has also done a wonderful job at describing the experience of being in the head of somebody who has all of these constantly invading obsessive thoughts sidenote over whether you have a mental disorder or not stress in all of its forms can have an effect on rosacea and rosacea can have an effect on your stress so whether it's because you have an anxiety disorder you're suffering from depression or there's just stuff going on in your life that makes you feel stressed for a moment or for a day or for a few days they can all play off of each other and nothing gives me a flare-up faster then Sun is definitely my top trigger I find that way easier to control those sun exposure is way easier to control then stress and anxiety and things like that and I can feel stressed and instantly flare up for that reason a major part of the Rosi lifestyle that I've been building to try and keep my rosacea symptoms under control has to do with actually controlling my stress which is good for me anyway since I do have anxiety disorder some panic disorders we have already talked for a lot longer than I'd meant to I kind of got a few babbles there but I really did want to set a foundation to let you know sort of where I'm coming from in terms of talking about stress and rosacea art 2 of this series is going to be about how rosacea is actually a trigger for various mental health conditions how it can cause more stress in a person's life and how it can actually increase the risk of mental health conditions I have been finding a lot of studies that I will be discussing in the next video and I will cite everything in the video description when that one comes out part three is going to be about how stress and anxiety and other mental health conditions can make rosacea symptoms worse so it's the other way around and I'm hoping to get into some coping techniques and things that have worked for me I don't know what worked for you but I'm hoping that by sharing what I'm going through it will give you something to discuss with your doctor or something to try out for yourself if you feel that it is appropriate for your condition either mentally or in terms of your rosacea because I feel that this is something that is affecting an awful of us and it hasn't been discussed enough this link which is very powerful and has been shown time and time again in research and has talked about in a lot of places that are specific to rosacea is not it's not getting out there quite as much we're talking more about foods and skincare products and the Sun and that kind of thing but our mental health isn't getting the attention that it probably should because it is affecting our lives and our rosacea symptoms for that matter so because of that I just wanted you to know that you are not the only one who is struggling with this kind of thing if you are struggling with it you are not alone and there are a lot of things that we can do to cope with our anxiety our stress and therefore a lot of the triggers that are making our rosacea symptoms worse so I hope you like this video I hope it was informative to you and helpful and entertaining in some way again if you do have any requests specific to stress and rosacea that you'd like me to cover in one of the future videos in this series then I hope you will make a comment and let me know what they are I will try to accommodate if I can if you did like this video I hope you will give me a big thumbs up that way I will know I do pay attention to the number of little thumbs ups that I get for a given video because that lets me know that that is a video that you enjoyed and that you would like to see you would like to see more of that type of thing in the future and if you do want to see more stuff like this then I hope you'll subscribe to my channel and click the little bell if you want to be notified every time I put out a new video I try to put them out every Sunday and sometimes I have one I would on Thursdays as well and everything and I will see you next time [Music] you",

        "transcript": "oh no need to be stressed out but this could cause some stress for you if you're experiencing redness in the face stinging skin occasional burning and swelling sometimes even accompanied by traditional acne this could be difficult it could be rosacea we have in guests to talk about this because this is actually rosacea awareness weeks we have Christie Harris who is a master esthetician at Shapiro plastic surgery and skin clinic with some of the solutions also the office offering some discounted procedures this month yes that we have addressed rosacea we are we are offering a special on frac Torah which actually is something that was originally designed to be an anti-aging treatment a lot of things we do in this business have a surprising side effect yeah one of those would be that it helps reduce acne and it's actually helped with some of the vessels especially around the nose so you kind of get multiple things that I could with one treatment okay yeah because I imagine some people confuse acne with rosacea and then they're putting some sort of treatment on so what are one of the some of the things that can cause rosacea flera ok so we talk about rosacea triggers and the triggers can vary from person to person that common triggers would be alcohol caffeine hot beverages also stress exercise heat hey you know don't shoot the messenger of a good setup so living in the desert and enjoying your caffeinated cocktail could be a recipe for disaster if you're into this and that's something that millions of people are prone to but but not everybody's gonna do yeah well it really goes undiagnosed quite a bit so you know one of the things that we want to look for our signs and symptoms so of course flushing broken blood vessels and sometimes you get little acne pappadeaux sometimes you don't so it's something that you want to see a doctor to get diagnosed and then you know how to go forward especially with which products are going to buy on let's show you we have both video of the treatment that you're talking about that fact or and also some before and after pictures so this is in device this is what a laser device this is actually radiofrequency with micro needling so those little pins are like needles and they help to drive the RF energy to the targeted area so the micro needling is big for anti-aging right and then why is that well because it helps to stimulate collagen okay but when we add radiofrequency to it this is why we're seeing these added benefits of reduced acne and improvement in vascular lesions because the radio frequency is heating up those targeted area oh ok and so what's the downtime from this well the downtime from this is probably going to be about three to four days so you want to give yourself a little bit of time to recover and always say downtime we're really talking social downtime okay so a lot of big differences in terms of the before and after so let's look at we've got some images here and you can see a real difference in the discovery discoloration and here's an acne client and this is after a single treatment this is really available because typically we would have to correct acne before we could address scars and this lets us do both at the same time ok so the broken blood vessels that's a big sign of the rosacea Roy sure yeah that's like the number one sign ok so topically what can we do at home to try to keep this in check well you know there's some things like mild cleansers and moisturizers that help one really big thing is a topical vitamin C I love that is clinical pro hill it has a c and e in it so it helps reduce inflammation ok and it also strengthens the wall of the blood vessels so that you don't get broken blood vessels so easily I other things that are really good we have a cool mint mass that is sort of cool and refreshing and on that same note the Hydra cool is a hydrating pooling serum that's also got a little bit of an antiseptic property so that's great for cooling the skin and also the bacteria and then real big is a physical sunblock so when we say physical we mean titanium dioxide okay oxide that's it that will help block out some of the heat and it's also less irritating than chemical sensor so that's very important for anybody with rosacea okay and Christy we're out of time but I want to mention your view of a blog as well yes best of both worlds AZ okay and when we can see her over at Paradise Valley a skin and plastic surgery office dr. Shapiro thank you so much your skin is always perfect Scott what are you gonna do yeah",

        "transcript": "hey says family welcome back to my channel today I wanted to do a little different video this is gonna be a lot different so for the next three months I'm gonna be doing something and basically I'm about to explain what I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna be going into my life into an area that you have not been a before that you heard me mention but I've never really delve into it um there's a lot of stuff going on that I feel the need that I need to inform you so that you know so if one day you wake up and this has happened then you know it was coming you're already prepared for it and you know what's coming next first of all my channel is here to stay I'm not about to delete it I'm not about to get rid of it I'm not gonna let this defeat me if it happens it happens if it does it it doesn't I'm not speaking it and I'm not saying that it's gonna happen I'm saying if so basically let me get into it okay so my eyesight has been going down and it's been going downhill for the past few months used to I could do this and I could literally see what was in front of me now when I'm not wearing my glasses my vision is extremely blurry and this guy right here is struggling to be able to straighten it out so where I can actually see out of this eye this eye has clearer vision than this side so I'm about to explain what's going on okay so first of all a hyper ization I wanted to get into rosacea with you because I mentioned it and a lot of people were like what's that and a lot of people were like okay you know but I want you to know the side of rosacea that you don't here about okay I don't know if you know people that have rosacea or not because there's a lot of people that don't even know what it is I didn't know what it was when I first found out I had it but after going through all the research that I went through I pretty much learned what it was okay so I have two forms of rosacea I have regular rosacea which is on the skin and then I have ocular rosacea which means it's in my eyes so a lot of people want to know what rosacea is so I'm going to go and I'm going to show you what rosacea is okay so the website that I'm using is a public website so there's no copyright or anything like that but I wanted to tell you exactly what rosacea was for those of you who don't know rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the central face and it is often characterized by flare-ups and remissions okay so rosacea develops in your t-zone if you wear makeup you know what I'm saying it develops in your t-zone this is your t-zone right here and it does not come out in here it stay strictly on your cheeks on your chin on your nose and right up here and when it spreads to your eyes that starts in the bottom and then it goes around up top so that's basically what it is it causes a lot whenever I first found out I have rosacea I was just having love patches here and there but as bad as it is now it itches it causes redness it causes flare-ups whenever you have a flare-up your skin literally feels like it's tightening just like that and in my case whenever I have a flare-up my skin breaks open and it literally starts bleeding and it's not pretty it's not fun it burns it hurts it literally is something that I do not want wish on my worst enemy which I don't have any worse enemies but if I did this is not something I would wish on anybody this is not something that you should ask for this is not something that people ask for this is something that people deal with for the rest of their life this is not something that's cured you literally have to live with rosacea every day for the rest of your life once you were diagnosed with it in my case I've been I've had recession since I was 25 years old it started in little spots on my face I thought I was getting acne I never had acne a day in my life and then all of a sudden when I turned 25 I started getting a little spice and I was like okay well I need to go wash my face I need to get a better cleanser no that's not what it was it was an actual inflammation under the skin on my face that was causing the rosacea to start developing once it started developing I started wearing makeup to cover it thinking that was gonna help and not realizing makeup made it worse okay then I started I was like okay well it's not a big deal because acne is not a big deal so then rosacea is not a big deal it's just a form of acne rosacea is not a form of acne rosacea is an actual inflammation under the skin as a result so basically it says here that it starts as early as 30 I started at 25 so it hit me long before I was 30 the ones that are it's not in this information but I know this the ones that are affected to develop rosacea are the ones that have pale white skin like me like literally pale there's no tan there um also if you have multiple children it affect this is how it affects the women you have pale white skin because that's something that is it rosacea results from and then you have multiple children you have a hormone imbalance anything like that can flare up rosacea it's not just in women guys can get it too and it's worse than guys because guys develop rhino nose rhino nose let me pull my glasses off rhino nose is where you're no swells from in here and the next thing you know your nose gets this big like it literally gets bigger about that much if you've ever want to look it up just go on google and type in rhino nose and you'll see what I'm talking about like rosacea causes a lot of stuff if after you get off this video you want to do more in-depth research they'll feel free go right ahead there's rosacea org you can google rosacea you can google ocular rosacea there's also rosacea that forms on your scalp it's it looks like dandruff but it's not dandruff so like I said if you decide after this video that you want to go do your own research then I don't blame you you can go ahead and do the research because y'all I'm fixing to have to literally dive in I say I'm gonna have to do more research than what I've been doing because it's done spread to my eyes I've got one right there and then it's starting right in here and it's already on my eyelids so I know it's at the points where I have to be really careful if it itches I can't rub my eyes like this you know how most people they take it and they just rub the eyelid I can't do that if I do that it's gonna damage my cornea and my cornea is where my vision comes from if I do that then I'm gonna damage my cornea and I don't want to damage my cornea because my vision is already going I already where I have to strain to see without glasses and even with these glasses I still have to strain you see I feel like something's on my face okay although rosacea can affect all segments of the population in all skin types individuals with fair-skinned who tend to flush or blush easily or believe to be at greatest risk the disorder has been more frequently diagnosed in women but tends to be more severe in men there is also evidence there is a shin matron running families and may especially be prevalent in people of northern or Eastern European descent so in other words I have northern or Eastern European descent heritage because those from northern and eastern europe are the ones that develop the rosacea I don't understand that but that's that's what this is telling me so I'm still trying to understand this myself what are the signs that I should look for in rosacea I um how to read this I can tell you okay so the signs that you look for whenever you have zatia are gonna be red patches that show up on your face it can show up right in here and it even gets right here on your lips like you can see the red packs red patches all over my face right in here and then it's right here and then it's right up in here right next to my eyes which it's done spray to my eyes so that's why it's right there it don't start out there and then you've got it up in here but on my forehead it's not as bad as what it is on my nose and on my chin like we're you know my cheeks so basically that's one thing you have to watch out for eaching of skin the difference between acne and rosacea is rosacea itches so if you've ever seen many and you've seen me do this on video and you're like why is she doing that that's because the rosacea itches and let me give you a little pinch don't scratch with your fingernails if you scratch with your fingernails there's little um bacteria that can form under your fingernails and when you scratch with your nails I'm not scratching on my nails I'm scratching with my fingers if you scratch with your nails you can cause it to get worse because you can cause the bacteria to get in your face all this is what the doctor told me you will also have bumps and pimples it's not acne pimples by no means y'all this is worse a regular pimple is like this small but err rosacea pimple literally raises off the face and next thing you know you have a whole spot where you've got a bomb that is so big that you can't even explain how to get rid of it and it is very very irritating you're gonna have visible blood vessels which I have those I have those on my eyelids up here because it's um and then I have it under my eyes and then on my nose on the very inner core you'll I have visible blood vessels and it's not something that okay let me explain something to you when you have rosacea you're very self-conscious about it you want to cover it you want to wear makeup you want to hide it and a lot of times you're not able to hide it because you can only cover it with makeup for maybe two hours and then it it literally breaks through the makeup like there is no makeup to last all day that I found that will cover it so you're constantly having to go if you're working you have to put more makeup on you're constantly having to go in the bathroom and apply on top more makeup more makeup more makeup and you're just piling it on there and then when you get home and you wash it off your face you can literally tell that you've washed it off of your face layers of makeup because it takes you two or three washes to wash all of it off your face this is not something that you play around with when you have rosacea see I didn't realize this I thought rosacea was just a form of acne I thought it was nothing to worry about but it is something to worry about it is something to be very careful about because certain foods certain environmental temperature certain house temperatures certain water temperatures can cause it to flare up and I didn't realize how bad it was until I started doing research when my husband and I got together I was like okay this is weird I'm starting to get this and I don't understand what I'm doing wrong this their triggers so that's where I found the wrote the website rosacea org because they have in-depth information on there about how you can find out if you've got rosacea how you can treat it I'm not to have a needle inserted in my face no no no no no I hate needles and I'm sure you're probably looking at the screen like laughing because I'm saying this but I do I hate needles the reason I say I hate needles is because one of the treatments for rosacea is Botox Botox why would anybody want that in their skin I've heard what Botox says I don't even want to try it I don't care if it costs ten dollars for a shot I'm still not getting it I would rather live every day with for a session and have someone injected with Botox in my face and then half deliver about every day like this because that's what would happen because I would literally have to go every two weeks and get a shot to control it and how do we know it's not making it worse okay and I've already told you about the eye irritation the secondary signs and symptoms of rosacea are burning and stinging swelling and dryness and I've already told you about the burning and the stinging because whenever it starts and you start itching and starts burning it starts tingling and can break open it can bleed it can be really really really bad now I'm sorry if there's some of you that are watching this like why is she telling me this watch till the end I promise you will want to watch to the end and I will explain at the end why I'm telling this because I'm just trying to be prepared I've already prepared my husband I've already told him what could come so I'm just trying to prepare y'all because if a point comes to where this happens and I literally have to completely change my youtube channel I want you all to know what's coming so you can pray for me that it doesn't come or if it does come that you can pray for me that I have strength because this is why I'm doing this video want you to know what's going on I want you to pray for me and I want you to help give me strength because this is gonna take a lot of strength to get through I've literally filmed this one other time but I cried so much in it that I've completely deleted it and I started over I said Marlene you've got to be strong you've got to be strong we've got to make it through this and I just told you what my real name is it's morally but Marlene is the long version for morally okay so you got to be careful about your skincare you gotta be careful what sunscreen you use you got to be careful what makeup you put on you got to be careful with face wash you use you got to be careful about perfume hairspray hairspray can trigger it perfume can trigger it makeup can trigger it this is a lot of triggers okay and then lifestyle management which basically means lifestyle and environmental factors now we're going to the triggers okay these are the triggers that trigger rosacea and now you're about to see why I said I've dramatically got to change my diet and I've got to change everything so you're about to see why I said that foods that cause rosacea the triggering liver yogurt

lift and load jobs so did you get all that did you understand that almost all of my favorite foods are in this list I'm gonna have to literally go from my favorite foods to eating only things that are for rosacea you know how when you're diabetic you have to drastically change your diet well it's the same thing with rosacea except you're not worried about sugar foods I mean you have to avoid sugar foods but you're not worried you know rosacea and diabetes is almost common you know they almost have something in common but with rosacea there's a wide range of foods that you're not allowed to eat and you have to avoid hot baths hot mass is one of my favorites I love to run a hot bath and just sit and relax but I can't do that anymore and then it gives the percentages of the factors and the people that were the people that have rosacea is tells how many percentage of people these triggers triggered and sun exposure was 81 percent I'm just gonna read the top 5 sun exposure was 81 percent emotional stress 79 percent hot weather 75 percent when 57 percent in heavy exercise 56 percent so as you can see it's a lot more than just red face it's a lot more than just pimples all over my face this is not something that I would wish on my worst enemy because yo I just wish that I knew what I did wrong to get this I never made fun of people with acne I would never do that but yet I ended up with the worst form of rosacea but that I've ever even heard about okay so now I'm gonna get into why I said I wanted you to be prepared and please understand that if this happens that my channel is

        "transcript": "hiya i hope you're keeping well um today i'm just going to do a quick rosacea catch up chat in particular with a few key tips that i think are really helpful for this time of year and if you don't know what rosacea is it's a condition that can cause redness and flushing and texture and lots of kind of irritation in the skin i would say and lots of people i speak to on here have rosacea i have two types of rosacea one that makes my skin flush and look quite red and another one that can come up quite textured in the skin and i think this time of year can really bring out that redness that sensitivity and i thought i would just recap on a few basic rosacea principles because i feel like time and time again i meet new people that want to discuss rosacea so i like to share things that dermatologists and doctors have told me i'm not a doctor i'm in no way able to diagnose you and i would first and foremost really recommend that if you think you have rosacea get it seen by a doctor because i can share a few tips and tricks that people recommend but ultimately your skin is completely personal to you and the best thing to do is get an absolute expert to look at that for you in terms of the research i've done around rosacea there are a few key things that can really help if you're struggling with your skin at the moment so first of all it's not absolutely fail safe but it's a great place to start have a little look at how much fragrance is in your skincare and if possible try and stick to a routine that's relatively fragrance free fragrance is quite a known irritant of rosacea and while that's not true with every single thing in my skincare collection you know some things do have fragrance in them and most of them i use are fragrance free and that when i first made that change initially really helped to calm things down another thing i would recommend if you think you have rosacea or you want to reduce the appearance of it cut back as much as you can you don't need a 12-step skincare routine a great cleanser a great moisturizer and a sun cream for the daytime is more than enough for you especially if you're finding your skin is you know going through a bit of a hard time by all means if you have redness or rosacea you can use your active ingredients you can exfoliate you can use retinol whatever you want to do again i would come back to the fact that your skin is completely unique and you will have to discuss that with your doctor to see what works best for you but as a general rule something that i've definitely been told by many experts in skin is that if your skin is flared up or particularly irritated or angry then avoid the active ingredients until it's calmed down again and just really take it back to basics um as a kind of guide to what i take my makeup off with i'll be honest with you when i first got diagnosed i was told cut out all the cleansing oils cut out anything like that and use a cream and really gently take your makeup off that's probably the thing that i have strayed from a good bit so i do sometimes use a cleansing oil i do actually use um how do you say the really soft microfiber flannels so that you can actually remove your makeup just with water if you want to but if you team that soft flannel with something like a cream it just makes it that bit easier and quicker however in a dream scenario you wouldn't use a flannel or anything abrasive just use that kind of cleansing cream and your hands and gently massage your makeup off but as i say that is what i do a lot of the time but on the days that i just want to get my makeup off quickly we all have those days i will use a cloth or maybe a cleansing oil or something that bit quicker i don't want to come on here and wax lyrical about all these steps that i'm doing when i know i've got a cleansing oil upstairs that i sometimes use you know so i'd rather just have that open chat um one of the things that i've found since kind of discovering my rosacea and learning more about it and all the rest of it a couple of things actually i always go on about her but my friend lex has a whole blog dedicated to rosacea so if there's a particular topic you're interested in reading up on or you've got a particular question or anything like that her blog is called talented lex and honestly like just have a big read of it before you do anything else because she's covered everything and she also on her instagram if you go onto her profile and you've got like the highlights along the top she's got all the key things that people ask there so you might be thinking okay what's the best foundation to use if i have rosacea she's probably already got something about that so just to have a little deep dive um she also has i wish i had them to hand her own company called the real skin club she just has lots of positive affirmations and things to encourage great mental well-being about rosacea someone pointed out to me years ago not even years ago just a while ago they said all you ever see when you google rosacea is negative stuff and it's something that's really stuck with me because you see all of these articles i actually had someone leave me a really um i know they meant well but a really quite strong comment recently about rosacea and i just thought you didn't need to do that like i know what rosacea is i don't need all of this like absolute negative stuff thrown at me and i personally i just think you know there's ways around it yes we're all going to have a flare up sometimes you're not going to have a good skin tone my skin isn't the best at the moment but you can cover it with makeup you can you know change your diet for that week that you want to have a good skin day and avoid things that you know trigger it there are things you can do to really make this manageable and i really want you to take away from this that this is manageable yes you've got redness you've got rosacea if you do have that you can absolutely manage it and make it a lot better and recently i've worked with a brilliant team behind this campaign rosacea beyond the visible they have essentially they're a team of you know experts doctors dermatologists you name it they've done a lot of research into rosacea and in particular into a patient's journey if they go to the doctor to discuss the rosacea and one of the things that they found um was that if you're going to the doctor for the first time because you have rosacea you might just be going and saying i've got these things in my skin that are presenting like redness but have you remembered to say how it's impacted your self-esteem have you remembered to say that you were upset when someone made a bad comment have you remembered whatever it is that your journey looks like they recognize that there is a huge emotional impact that comes with having rosacea and they made this document that i think is brilliant that it's almost like a questionnaire that you can fill out and say all of these things it's kind of they'll ask you the questions so that you can go to the doctor prepared with the information to say i had three fret flare-ups last week my skin is textured and flaring up and i've got it around my eyes it makes me feel down it makes me feel whatever it might be for you because you might not think to articulate it in that way but when you look at it on this sheet of paper these are really real and really valid part of having any kind of skin condition and but one of the things i'm really passionate to emphasize i speak to so many people that have just kind of resigned themselves to the fact that this is what their skin looks like and there's nothing that can be done and it's distressing and all the rest of it there are so many great things that a doctor can do to help you work with your skin and don't feel you know embarrassed or ashamed to go and ask for this because a number of people have said to me in the past i don't want to waste a doctor's time it's a trivial thing to go for but ultimately if you broke your arm or your wrist or something you'd go to the doctor and also if this is impacting how you feel in yourself and your self-esteem and you know your day-to-day then it's absolutely something to go to the doctor for in particular because i know having been to the doctor myself and used at the moment i'm not using any creams from the doctor because i went before they worked so well that i saw such an improvement i was able to come off them kind of a thing that's just my experience i wouldn't rule out going again um there are really quick fixes you might be upset about this thing that you think is you know not gonna be solved and it actually can be so key takeaway if you're new here you can expect makeup tips and tricks to cover in rosacea i've got loads of videos already in a rosacea playlist on youtube and on instagram with loads of skin recommendations so i hope you don't mind that i don't go back to each individual message with a full list of my routine it's just that it's already in those videos and by all means i try and actually pad them out with loads of suggestions so that you've got loads of options to think well that one that one that one sounds like it'll work for me because i don't know what texture of moisturizer you like i don't know your lifestyle i don't know how best to advise you one on one but i can give you all of the information and then you can pick the things that seem to resonate and work best for you um but i will put a link in the description of this video to that form so if you're thinking of having a conversation with someone or going to the doctor just have a look at it it'll help you to articulate everything that's going on with your skin just know as well that doctors are aware that previously there hasn't been enough um kind of knowledge and education around rosacea and how to have a conversation about it how to deal with it and they're all really really conscious that they want your experience of visiting a doctor to go as smoothly as it can and give you the support that you know they want you to have um but anyway i hope you enjoyed i'd love to know actually if you're using anything in particular that's working really well for you because i'm sure someone else would love to hear about that as well and i'll talk to you soon",

        "published_at": "2021-11-26T18:06:23Z",
        "transcript": "would you believe me if i tell you that the mites on your face are causing these red angry looking bums also known as rosacea hi friends i'm chris and i'm a dermatology trainee working in the west of scotland in the uk and in this video i'm going to dive straight into the topic rosacea specifically we're going to cover what it is how it looks like as well as the various steps and treatments we can do to help prevent and manage this common skin condition we are also going to touch on the things that you can do to help with your skin as well as the various treatment options we have in dermatology in the uk so what on earth is rosacea well this is a very common skin condition predominantly affecting the middle age groups as well as people with fair skin we don't exactly know what causes this but it is thought to be due to a combination of genes environmental factors as well as an overabundance of a type of mite also known as the demodex mites now these are small little creatures that love growing and crawling around the hair follicles and it's actually present in every single one of us however in people with rosacea it is thought that they are more sensitive to these mites and thereby causing inflammation of the skin leading to flushing and redness rosacea can also be triggered by a variety of things which i've listed in this video and the most common trigger that we see in our clinics is actually direct sunlight and this is why we always advise our patients to wear sunscreen at all times to help prevent rosacea there are of course other known triggers such as caffeine in your tea coffee alcohol spicy food and even exercise and it's actually really anything that makes your blood vessels beneath the skin dilate causing the flushing and redness you see in rosacea now i think it's important for us to classify the rosacea into various subtypes as they can look quite different and also the treatments for each subtype can be different as well one of the commonest subtype of rosacea is the erythematolangitic rosacea also known as the vascular rosacea this can be quite a mouthful to pronounce but essentially patients presents with flushing redness of the face and telangiectasia which also means dilated blood vessels now the flushing is usually temporary at the start but as the rosacea worsens it can become permanent the other very common subtype of rosacea is the papillopascillar rosacea also known as the inflammatory rosacea and in this subtype patients get this angry looking red bumps also known as papules and pasteurs which are essentially papules containing parts inside now i think it is important for us to identify papillopascular variant of rosacea as they can look quite similar to acne vulgaris and so you may ask how do i actually tell the difference well essentially the triggers for rosacea don't necessarily exacerbate acne the other important thing to note is that the lesions for rosacea typically affect the central face so this would include the forehead both cheeks the nose and the chin and they typically spare the temples and the sides of the jawline of the face lastly in rosacea we don't normally get the white or blackheads that you see in acne and these are also known as comedomes which are basically clogged up hair follicles now the other two subtypes are not as common but we do still see them in our practice one of them is called the ocular rosacea and as the name suggests ocular meaning eye patients with this type of rosacea typically get eye symptoms such as burning itching and grittiness of the eyes and if this is left unchecked and untreated it can cause permanent scarring and so it is important for you to seek help quite early on so that you can get the appropriate management the last subtype is the phymatus rosacea also known as rhinophyma now this subtype is particularly difficult to treat and essentially means thickening and deformity of the skin particularly affecting the nose so your usual creams gels lotion and potions that you use to treat rosacea probably wouldn't work for this subtype of rosacea and you may need more aggressive treatments like laser therapies and even surgery so now you may ask how do we treat rosacea the important thing for any subtype of rosacea is to identify and potentially avoid or limit any triggers triggering rosacea what i'll recommend is to keep a diary for anything that can exacerbate your rosacea and try to limit or cut down one trigger at a time you don't have to be prescriptive about this because ultimately it is your quality of life we are talking about and it's all about weighing the pros and cons when it comes to avoiding things you may like so for example if your rosacea is triggered by eating spicy food and you just so happen to love spicy food and you eat spicy food every single time it is probably quite difficult and even impossible for you to limit eating spicy food because it will just make you very miserable so instead of avoiding things completely you may wish to perhaps limit the amount of exposure and be more rigorous when it comes to your skin care regime another important thing you can do is to treat your skin as though it is super sensitive always always remember to wear a good sunscreen as we know sunlight is the number one trigger for rosacea wearing sunscreen not only prevents rosacea it also helps reduce the risk of skin cancer and slows down aging another tip is to use non-fragrance and non-comedogenic facial cleansers and moisturizers which help protect the skin berry function try to find cleansers that are more acidic with a ph similar to the skin so between four to five rather than harsh soaps which are more alkaline and can be quite irritating and traumatic to the skin an example you can try is the serraphy hydrating facial cleanser another important tip is to keep your skin care as simple as possible now for patients who have sensitive skin who are more prone to getting acne and rosacea i would advise against using toner because toner can actually strip off the essential oils and moisture in your skin making it more inflamed so for specific subtypes like for example the erythematologic rosacea other than the advice that i've given before and doctors in the uk can also prescribe a topical gel called movaso gel which contains bromonidin 0.03 now this is licensed and indicated for facial redness and flushing and we typically advise patients to use once a day the only issue with this gel is that it can cause rebound redness when it's stopped and so it's often quite difficult when patients try to come off it another treatment that we can offer in the uk is an oral medication called propranolol which helps to shrink down any dilated blood vessels now as you can imagine this is an oral tablet so it can cause systemic side effects such as slowing your heart rate down and so this is something that we don't normally prescribe in the uk for rosacea unless it is absolutely crucial also if your facial redness is permanent causing discomfort and psychological distress sometimes we can think of laser treatments for example ipl and housed dye laser the only thing is that i'm not exactly sure if these treatments are still available under the nhs which is the national health service for those people living in the uk as such and you may wish to consider going for these treatments privately but make sure that you seek out a reputable and recognized healthcare professional who knows what they are doing you may also wish to consider camouflage makeup with a green tinted base to help correct the redness and help even out the skin tone now in the uk there is a camouflage service provided by a charity called changing faces and this is something that you can register either yourself or get your gp to refer you onwards to this service and in this service what they do is that they would look at your skin tone show you the products that they use the different shades that would match your skin tone as well as how to apply the products now for people who are suffering from the papillopascular type of rosacea we do have a variety of treatments available for people who are suffering from mild to moderate symptoms we can offer topical treatments in the first instance and in the uk there are three mainstay topical treatments we offer the first one is ivamatin cream also known as cilantra which you can apply once a day to the affected areas for up to four months the other treatment is metronidazole gel also known as rosex gel which you can apply twice daily for up to four months and lastly we have the acelic acid 15 cream with the brand name being called phoenicia and we often ask patients to apply to their face twice a day for up to six months these treatments are typically prescribed by your healthcare professional in the uk but i think you can get the acelic acid treatments over the counter through brands like the ordinary products choice as well as natural once the rosacea is more well controlled you can then reduce the frequency down to once or twice a week as a form of maintenance therapy if your symptoms are more severe then we may consider a combination of oral antibiotic and the topical treatments and the oral antibiotics include things like lemon cycline and doxycycline now bear in mind this is a prescription only medication and so you may wish to speak to your healthcare professional like your gp or local dermatologist in your area to find out more the aim of using antibiotics is more for the anti-inflammatory properties rather than antibacterial and typically patients stay on the antibiotics for at least three months for it to actually work now if the symptoms continue to be persistent despite topical and oral antibiotics sometimes in dermatology we offer low-dose isotretinoin also known as roaccotin now this is a treatment similar to that for acne severe acne in fact but actually the dose used for rosacea is much lower than that used for acne now as for people suffering from the phymatis variant of rosacea and the topical treatments and as well as the or antibiotics they won't work because of the deformity and soft tissue swelling in this case sometimes we can refer you onwards to laser treatments as well as surgical interventions to help remove the excess soft tissue and as far as i know these services are still available in some health boards across the uk so you may wish to speak to your local dermatologist to find out more now for people who are suffering from eye symptoms or ocular rosacea other than minimizing the aggravating factors like for example excessive central heating excessive air conditioning and even smoky environments i think it is important for you to make sure that you keep your eyelids as clean as possible this means cleaning them with a cotton wool soaked in warm water and if you get sticky bits underneath your eyelids you can wash them with using baby shampoo also if your eyes get dry you can buy over the counter lubricating eye drops and try to go for the ones without preservatives to keep your eyes moisturized throughout the day one thing that people don't realize is that sometimes medications can exacerbate eye dryness so have a look at your regular medications particularly if you are on a lot of regular medications such as certain antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications as they can sometimes exacerbate eye dryness in dermatology we sometimes use all antibiotics to help dampen down inflammation but if your eye symptoms are very bad and severe we can refer to our ophthalmology colleagues in the eye clinic for their review as well now before i close off this video i just want to say that oftentimes we underestimate how distressing skin conditions can be for people i know that it is not the same as say if someone suffers a stroke or a heart attack rosacea is not life-threatening but they can cause a huge impact on our daily activities and social life skin conditions can make you look and feel different from the people around you and this ultimately can cause you to lose confidence in yourself and cause self-esteem issues i just want to say that for anyone who is watching this video suffering from any skin condition no matter how severe or mild it may be and if you are suffering from this and please don't suffer this alone speak to someone about it and get help as soon as possible there are tons of support groups online and that can help support you through this journey i myself suffered from really bad severe acne and this had caused significant long-term scarring which i still have to this day and so i hope by doing these videos i would empower you guys including healthcare professionals and with the necessary tools and knowledge in tackling of these skin conditions at an early stage i will also provide several links down in the description box below which you may want to check out if you want to read out more about rosacea and if you're interested to know more about skin conditions in general do check out my video on keratosis polaris where i talk about another very common skin condition that pretty much almost everyone suffers from thank you for watching see you later bye",

        "transcript": "[Music] [Music] welcome to the healthy skin show with jennifer fugo where we're flipping everything you've been told about your chronic skin issues upside down and connecting you with alternative solutions your dermatologist never told you about welcome back to episode number 158 of the healthy skin show in today's episode we're going to be talking about rosacea specifically a rosacea warriors story her personal story living and thriving with something called granulomatosis rosacea it's a really specific form of rosacea that well we're going to share some before and after photos in the blog post that's associated with this particular episode because i think it's helpful for you to just see that especially if you haven't had rosacea before if you know someone who has like rosacea can go from being just like mildly flushing in the face within like the forehead nose and cheek and kind of like chin region to being in a sense really embarrassing and truly transforming in a way that no one could ever imagine possible and so it's important that we bring awareness to this that especially in a day and age where it's not uncommon for people with rashes to be looked at as diseased or contagious and people make all sorts of really unpleasant comments and my guest today i think is incredibly brave for sharing her story and sharing why this journey was so life-changing to her because not only is she just like she's a human being but she's also a licensed esthetician and so skin care especially on your face is what she does for a living and so having this happen to her seemingly out of the blue just really rocked her world and i'm so grateful to have her here today and before we dive into that conversation i just want to also make it clear that there is a really deep emotional and mental component to having skin rashes so it is okay if you feel a certain way about how you look i think a lot of people go oh my gosh i don't want to be vain but the reality is that the way we show up does impact our energy and how confident we feel in that particular circumstance and i think that many of us try to power through or muscle through or you have people just say oh who cares you just be who you are it doesn't matter how you look but the reality is that how you feel is how you feel and it's important to honor those particular feelings rather than push them down and allow them to act as another point of pain in your life and so i wanted to share a piece of an email that i received recently that exemplifies this so this was from a reader of my newsletter and she shared you sent an email about the emotional toll of eczema a while ago i have been wanting to thank you for that i obviously knew that having eczema was hard but i don't know if i fully realized the impact that it had on my psyche and confidence until reading through that email you sent as well as the podcast kind of a light bulb moment and legitimized my experience it literally brought tears to my eyes in a relief sort of way thank you for opening up about your experience in this way and bringing light to the emotional aspects of skin issues and thank you for all the work that you do in general i've been following you for a while and really appreciate your work the reason i share this is because the emotional impacts that we get especially when skin issues skin rashes skin conditions are very front and center right it impacts your face or your hands and it's not easy to cover up yes the areas that can be covered up are are certainly triggering and can be triggering for people right maybe you don't feel you can wear shorts or you can wear a bathing suit or you can wear short sleeves or a tank top however when it's front and center and you can't wear clothes to even cover up the rash that can be even more triggering because it's always with you every moment of the day you can't escape it and i just want to hold space for anyone who is listening to this whether you have rosacea you have eczema you have psoriasis whatever that is impacting your face that if there are emotions that come up that it is okay to feel them and in fact it's important to feel them it's important to acknowledge them not to push them down or push them aside and say it doesn't matter and it's all in your head because the reality is we'd all love to act as if this experience of living with a rash like once it goes away i'll be better i'll feel confident and i can tell you that that is not always the case the things that happen to us those traumas those stressors don't just disappear simply because you finally figure out how to get the rash to go away so i think this is an important conversation to preface today's interview with because confidence and the way that we hold ourselves right it's not about how other people necessarily see us because we can't control that but we can control the way in which we hold our self-image our self-worth our self-confidence in a sense it's almost like having to approach yourself as you would a child and provide the same kindness loving and care that you would to a child that is really suffering um i'm not a therapist but i do know what it's like to feel so shameful that you don't want to see people that you don't want to go out in public i couldn't hide my hands they were very obvious your face is typically the most obvious spot hands can be the next most obvious spot because we shake hands we write um you know wearing gloves in the middle of warm weather seems strange and weird to a lot of people and especially even in the wintertime if you're wearing like some sort of random sort of glove that's not a winter glove and you're inside and people don't understand that and they make comments and they stare and so i think for many of us we have to hold space i know it's hard because we're holding space for a lot we're holding space for all of the symptoms and the issues that we experience however we also need to hold space for the emotions that come up and know that it's okay for them to be there and one little caveat to this i just want to say that it is also okay for you to and this is a term that i see a lot online is unhide your skin it is perfectly okay to do that in fact i'm all for that meaning that you're not necessarily walking around in pants because you have rashes on your legs that you just show up however you show up you wear whatever makes you feel comfortable it's also okay if you're not comfortable showing up showing your rashes to cover them up you do whatever makes you feel the most comfortable there is no judgment there never should be any judgment and it's a huge step out of many people's comfort zones initially to start unhiding their skin but i just want to make that point that because we're talking about this concept of wanting to hide and that you can't hide your face it's equally okay to not hide and in fact i try to encourage clients to not hide but again you can't put yourself in a position where if you're trying to be more self-confident you then end up putting yourself in a position where unhiding those rashes creates an excessive amount of stress and pressure on yourself that you're just not ready for in that particular moment so know that it's all okay there is no straight line there's no rule book there's no playbook there's no manual on how to do any of this and to overcome these issues and traumas that we get from living with skin rashes but what i do want to underline is that wherever you are it's okay and it's okay to feel the positive feelings as well as the negative ones it's okay unfortunately here on the healthy skin show we have a number of episodes that we'll link to in the show notes that also help talk about these underlying issues that impact our confidence that way perhaps it'll give you some ideas some starting points and if you feel like you need some additional help i would encourage you wholeheartedly to reach out to some sort of counselor or therapist or coach that has a lot of experience dealing and supporting people through this that way you can get the appropriate type of support that you need to help you most all right so with all of that said let's dive into today's discussion with my guest [Music] hi everyone welcome back i have a guest with me today that i am very excited and honored to have on the show and one of the main reasons why is that i have been trying for over a year to get someone to come on the show to share their story of living and ultimately thriving with rosacea and i came across our guest today's uh profile on instagram and i was really touched by her story and her willingness to share everything that she has gone through and asked her to be here and so she's going to share her story with you today and i think it's important for those of you who are listening to all of these different episodes especially when we dive into the science or we talk about food to hear someone who has gone through this personally and what her experience was like and so i'm just deeply appreciative to have our guest today gabrielle buckman with us she is a licensed esthetician in st louis missouri she was diagnosed with gran well you're going to have to probably help me with this granulomatosis rosacea is that correct gabrielle it's granulomatic granulomatous rosacea a year ago in may so that was may 2019 and um she uses her training in skin as and fortunately um with the help of a very wonderful dermatologist she was able to get her rose shot under control and so she also helps her own clients in the st louis missouri area overcome obstacles of their own skin conditions and many of the reasons which you share is because you can relate to them so gabrielle i just want to thank you so much for being here yeah thank you for having me so since we're talking about rosacea would you mind sharing with us how did rosacea pop up in your life when did this happen and what was going on what was this introduction into rosacea like for you yeah so like you had said um it's been a little over a year now i had just switched birth controls um i just went from the name brand birth control to generic and all of a sudden i started breaking out and i was just like oh this is hormonal with the change um so i didn't think much of it but it started getting worse and worse and it almost looked like an infection on my nose area so i did go to the doctor and they thought that it was a staph infection i went to two separate doctors and they both thought that um so i got on antibiotics right away and nothing was changing so finally i found my dermatologist that i'm going to now um and she realized that it was actually granulomatic rosacea um but it's such a rare form that they didn't realize that that's what it was at the time um so it's it was hard i have had perfect skin beforehand um being an esthetician i really take care of my skin and take pride in it so all of a sudden it was red and crusty and there were these pustules all over the place and i was super self-conscious wanted to cover my face all the time i wore a mask when i was at work and a band-aid over my nose um it was difficult and for you like you're looking at yourself in the mirror did you have any guesses as to what you thought was going on like did you just think it was like a weird acne issue or maybe an infection at first i did agree with them that i thought it looked like an infection it did look very similar to like a staph infection or infantigo and what did you try because i'm gonna guess being an esthetician you're like okay i can probably try some different things but like what did you try that you thought might help but but ultimately didn't yeah so i originally thought it was acne at first before it started turning into an infection um so i was trying the wrong things for rosacea i was doing like salicylic acids and all of these harsh things on my face and it was not working it was just exacerbating the rosacea and so it sounds to me like what you've learned from this experience and i i would guess if any listeners are really into they're like oh my gosh this sounds like me it's like you have to know what you're dealing with right because that can make it worse it's very important to get a diagnosis for what you're dealing with you're just treating at home yeah and and when you finally got the right diagnosis what did the dermatologist tell you at that point um so she actually put me on a sulfur face watch um and i started taking doxycycline 100 milligrams a day um but she honestly told me that this type of rosacea the chance of it going away of this obviously the chances were slim to none that i would probably live with it forever in some way shape or form but i'm here today and it's completely almost invisible to see at the moment when she told you that like you're you might have to live with this for the rest of your life like you're you might not get rid of this how did that feel it was absolutely crushing i was i felt so depressed i was like looking online for support groups and it was so rare that i couldn't find anyone who was struggling exactly with what i had um i was just horrible and it's on your face so it's very difficult right even with makeup it would have been difficult to cover up oh yeah it was almost impossible to cover up because there were those crusts and everything on there that you could still see and the redness alone is hard to cover yeah did she give you any sense of why this can happen your dermatologist that is why this type of rosacea may form in some people um really she said that they don't know very much about granulomatous um but they do think it has a genetic component to it and what do you think are maybe some of the reasons why i don't know if you have any thoughts or suspicions but do you have any thoughts at this point in time being on this journey for the last year or so of why this might have popped up it's interesting because you did mention you switched the birth control pill so there was a hormonal shift there but what are your suspicions um yeah so i think that hormonal obviously um it's triggered by stress i do think um and diet i think my diet has affected it a lot as well and so what about your diet because i mean we talk about a lot of food things on the healthy skin show we talk about gut health and all sorts of things and how it's connected to skin so in your particular instance what did you discover i'm sure you did some trial and error yes um so my big triggers or anything like greasy pizza if i have ice cream even chocolate things like that cheese um i found they're pretty common with everyone that those are kind of food triggers and did you try any other types of like remedies that you found online that maybe didn't really work i didn't actually try anything else you're lucky a lot of people try all these different staffs and create and i'm sure you see that though as an esthetician right people go online they're like oh wait i found this mask and this woman like her skin is beautiful and i want to look like that and i now my skin's all messed up yes a common one that people use is horse paste i haven't tried that i do kind of want to try it just to see if it works but horse paste yes what is horse paste there's an ingredient in horse paste that is supposed to help with the inflammation and redness oh wow i have never heard that before and is that for those who have rosacea yeah it's very common okay and so in working with a lot of women with rosacea what are some key points that you try to press impress upon them when they're coming to you now as their esthetician but also as someone who is like you're a rosacea warrior i mean you've been through this and you are living with this every day and you have this sort of it's almost like it's your friend and reminding you like hey um we need we're a little out of balance here gotta get back in balance but what are some things that you could share with people who are still in the midst of dealing with this and feeling really self-conscious and really maybe even embarrassed about the way they look so it's definitely something that there are so many other people that are going through it right now and if with the right skin care and the right treatment it can look better if not completely disappear altogether um but you just have to be consistent with a good skincare regimen with a good prescription from your dermatologist and try to remain positive and know that it will get better eventually when you find the right things and so you were saying before like the acne type of approach with these like i think they're like the harsher almost like i think of them as like kind of stripping ingredients but you can correct me you know you know more about that than i do um it is probably not your friend no that's not the way to go when you have rosacea you really want to give it all the love that you can um the main ingredients that i recommend to my clients are the loving moisturing anti-inflammatory anti-redness ingredients they're going to be like niacinamide glycerin ceramides hyaluronic acid and then of course you're going to need a good spf and why is that why why would someone think to put spf on their face i would assume every single day if they have rosacea yeah so the sun is not your friend when you have rosacea the heat that just causes extra inflammation in your face so it's best to do like a mineral based or a physical sunscreen as opposed to like the white chemical sunscreen that most of us use in the summer because that chemical sunscreen is going to pull in all of the heat from the sun and it's just going to redistribute it throughout your face so it's going to cause extra redness and inflammation so if you're using a good physical or mineral sunscreen it's going to bounce those rays back off so you're not getting that extra heat in your face which causes the redness and when you say a mineral sunscreen for someone who doesn't they might say i don't know what that means like are there specific types of brands or products or like is there a label that we should look for yeah so you're looking for a sunscreen that has titanium dioxide and and or zinc oxide in it um that's what makes it able to bounce those rays back off okay and but when i think of zinc oxide i'm thinking of like at the beach super white nose like is that what a sunscreen like should you look very whited out from this or is it something where it has such a low level where you're not going to um de-pigment your face to that that's that real intense degree like we think of at the at the beach so to speak yes no so it shouldn't be a lot of times the physical and mineral sunscreens are actually um very liquid they're kind of runny almost um you can get them that are white but a lot of the brands they make tinted so i would always recommend that route just so you're not white ever give you a little bit of tint and do you ever recommend any sort of like hydrosols or like and and actually this i think this is a great question because this is so like your face is we all like to think that i've had so many clients tell me and i've even said i'm not vain i'm not i know it sounds like i'm being vain i'm not like let's be honest we all like to show up feeling our best and when you don't feel like you look your best because um i've had other issues on my face where i've had to have like things burned off because of sebaceous gland hyperplasia so i get it i know what that's like um but like what would be a good skincare routine for someone who doesn't know who maybe was just buying for many years noxzema or cetaphil or you know they didn't know that they're supposed to even put moisturizer on their face i mean frankly i'm 40 and i didn't know until like two years ago that i was supposed to wash my face use a toner then to the moisturizer like i didn't know so if you're talking to a total newbie who now has a rosacea what would you recommend as an esthetician and as someone who has gone through this is what would your skin care routine look like so when you have rosacea you're going to want to keep it simple so obviously the esthetician in me doesn't love that because i love the 10 step skincare routine reuse everything but with rosacea you have to keep it simple you just need a few products it's going to make it to where um you don't have as much of a chance for that irritation if you're keeping it simple so you're going to want to look for like a creamy or a milk cleanser after that you're not going to want to use a toner or anything you would just want to go straight into a serum where that's where i say do like a hyaluronic acid serum or they make specific like rosacea relief serums that's where you do that and then you would just do a really moisturizing moisturizer with like ceramides in it the niacinamide that's a good place to have your niacinamide at and then this is the color mineral spf and that would be it that's all you should be using okay and then another quick question for someone who you know they've got rosacea but they're also at that point where they're dealing with uh you know i want to do throw a little bit of anti-aging in there and so they try and do like anti-aging products on their rosacea skin could there potentially be a conflict there where anti-aging products could exacerbate the rosacea yes it's really common obviously with the retinols that's the number one go-to for anti-aging as well as the vitamin c it can cause a lot of irritation and redness for you um so a way to combat that with the vitamin c is just to look for a brand that has a lower l ascorbic um level so you'd want to do like 15 and are lower um there's one that i really like is clinical makes the c um that's specifically for people with resistance it's got that lower level of the antioxidants in it or percentage like a 0.5 percent products you'd want to make sure that like all of your and that your okay and that's really helpful to know because i think sometimes like we straddle two different worlds and you're like well i gotta pick one do i have to pick one and oh okay if i have to pick one where should i go and so it's good to know that probably opting out of the anti-aging skincare may be really helpful and might help people who are dealing with this every day realize that the skincare that they're using is actually count it's not it's it's really not helpful right because that's what i discovered with my own issue which is totally aside from this and some of you guys heard uh myself and rachel pontillo talk about that on the healthy skin show i was using um cleansers and oil-based toners or no oil-based serums and oil-based moisturizers it actually made my skin way worse and i didn't know that i was i was like doing it to myself and it was very expensive that's very expensive very painful and so um it's important that we we understand these different things so i was just thinking of myself and listening to you because you're so knowledgeable about all this and that's what happens when you don't you don't always realize how much education you end up getting until you're in it right where you're just like you're faced with this problem you're like oh my gosh i need to figure this out and you already know a lot but you start to learn a lot more as a result so you ended up with this issue and you started working on it and i want to just be clear before i ask you this question i'm i am not implying for everybody listening that your experience is going to be the same as gabby's but i'm going to ask her the question of so you started dealing with this right you go to the dermatologist you start swapping things out you start removing these dietary flares from your diet how long more or less did it take you to get from looking your worst all the way to looking um i mean right now i frankly wouldn't really know that you had rosacea from looking at you um how long did it take to get to a healthier state of skin for you um so it was a lot of trial and error was not an easy journey by any means um so it took me at least six months to see any kind of difference whatsoever um in at least nine to ten months before i was really confident in my skin again thank you thank you thank you for being very honest about that because i don't i don't know about you but when i had eczema i didn't like that i took this out of my diet and i'm eczema free and i'm like exactly you know telling everybody that like it's a quick fix bam you're better tomorrow and you're like that's not my experience so no the fact that you you know you really this was a journey for you even though you found the right things to do there was some trial and error but it took time for your skin to rebalance and so did was this a lesson in a sense of impatience yes absolutely i wanted it right now i wanted my skin to look better especially with having to go to work and i wanted my clients to think i knew what i was doing and yeah it really took a lot of patience to love my skin again and get it to a healthy place do you um if now let's just say like tomorrow you wake up and you start to see things going in the wrong direction what are some signs or clues for you that a flare could be headed your way um when i slip up and don't follow all my stuff to a t if i forget a step in my skincare or if i eat something that's a trigger for me um if i was out in the sun if i i've participated in any of my triggers or eaten something that's my trigger i know that it's coming so it it it has helped you in a sense it sounds like stay on a path because it's there is a certain motivation there to want to keep your skin healthy which i can completely understand yes yeah yeah been there done that we understand everybody listening understands what this is like and um i just want to thank you so much gabrielle for sharing your story because i know number one for everybody who's listening this is gabrielle's first time ever on a podcast you'd never know she did a great job and i really appreciate you being here

        "transcript": "if you have ocular rosacea\u00a0\nor even just regular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 this video is for you. Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "transcript": "[Music] thank you hope cook with durhamcast TV today I have Dr Hilary Baldwin Dr Baldwin is a board-certified dermatologist she's also medical director of the acne treatment and Research Center in Brooklyn New York she is also a clinical associate associate professor of Dermatology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center welcome Dr Baldwin it's my pleasure to be here thank you yeah I'm excited about learning more about acne and rosacea okay so will you start off by telling us the four pillar approach to treating acne sure um you know we know a lot about acne pathophysiology mostly in the last oh 10 15 years things have sort of come into focus and we recognize that there are four separate pillars there's an increase in sebum production which occurs at puberty under the influence of the increase in androgens there is follicular hyperkeratinization where the inside of the hair follicle basically gets all clogged up with epidermal cells and sebum and such we have an increased colonization of cactus the bacterium that lives in the follicle as well as an increase in the inflammatory process and the concept of treatment involving these four pillars is that the more of them you hit the more you can affect each one of those the better the ultimate treatment is we know that for example the average successfully treated acne patient is on 2.53 different medications right so you want to pick one from column A and one from column B and if possible one criminality and one from column D put them all together and you have the best possible treatment we have one drug that does that itself isotradinoin which has all four pathogenic pillars yeah and you mentioned like primary care doctors will sometimes send patients over to see us and they're on topical clindamycin and oral Minocycline or something like that they've picked the same pillar because perhaps it's something that they're comfortable with they know which drug to pick but two from the same pillar doesn't make any sense at all you want to be attacking acne from as many directions as possible unclog the pore reduce the sebum kill the bacteria reduce the inflammation and you have yourself a winner do you try to go over that with patients or do you have a handout I actually do I mean you know because you can't take the teacher out of the girls so I have a simplistic version of course I separate the paper into four pieces the one pillar in each one I wouldn't say dumbed down but simplified lay terms of course and then I enter into it the medications that we're going to be introducing that day so that they understand why and then I put that I used to put it in their chart now I scan it into their chart so that the next time they come in and say okay well this is what we did and as you notice your blackheads are a little bit better so that retinoid doing its job but your inflammatory lesions not doing all that well we're going to have to you know increase upper ante in that regard I think they take to that very well it's more likely that they're going to realize that I haven't given them multiple medications as a plot to destroy their lives yeah I've done it for a reason and each one of them plays a role and as a matter of fact we're moving one of them could be deleterious to their response yeah and it seems like they would take more ownership of their treatment completely agree yeah and then does it also help when you see isotretinoin in every yes category yes it does not persuade parents yes they really get it of course we call it Accutane when we do that because they don't know from my no one but yes when I put a gigantic Scarlet a in each one of the boxes they recognize oh okay that's why my precious Junior needs to be on this medication that I'm the internet tells me I have to be concerned about yes speaking of the internet how has that changed your practice with social media and kids watching Tick Tock and you know it's always been a problem but it's coming from a different place and I I remember a lot you know in the 80s when we were practicing paleo Dermatology when there was no social media kids were still using toothpaste to make their act still I remember this and and it happened to me just the other day things haven't changed it's just the way in which they've been told about the toothpaste and the tomato paste yeah that looks really great on skin so and the whole concept of diet and so the myths still persist they're just coming from a different location the one that drives me the most crazy and tell me if this one drives you crazy too is drinking more water where I have not heard that one yes well they they say it as an excuse I know this is my fault I should be drinking first of all acne is not your fault and second of all the only person that benefits from you drinking more water is the bottled water industry that's right um it's all a gigantic conspiracy it seems to me yeah all right so what are some of the most common mistakes you see new providers with acne and just things they forget to tell patients or that's a really good question you know I I suppose the biggest mistake that all of us make regardless of how long we've been in practice is not educating the patient enough but we've sort of already reviewed that kind of thing you cannot educate a patient too much I think that it's very important to tell them that they're going to have the potential side effect of the drug you're giving them and then if they don't everything's cool so you know prepare for the worst and hope for the best you're going to be dry you're going to be irritated and then when they come back well it wasn't as bad as you said oh isn't that nice you know so under educating is crucial not picking from enough categories is crucial um relying too heavily on antibiotics in general um I think we feel more comfortable with oral antibiotics than we do with some of the other medications but you know we're responsible for a huge chunk of the antimicrobial resistance that we're seeing now and we need to stop doing that so looking for non-antibotic approaches which often requires more medications and working a bit harder but well worth it in the end and make sure that you're explaining to the patient I could just cop out and give you an antibiotic but that's not good for you and it's not good for the world and you said that you know a long time ago the thought was p acnes is needs to be eradicated right can you say more about that can be it it lives in the follicle you can decrease the numbers temporarily um but unless you do something else the numbers will come right back up again so people will say they failed a course of antibiotics everybody fails a course of antibiotics for acne not for pneumonia or something right but for acne you decrease the numbers you come off of it the numbers go right back up again so you have to intervene when the numbers are low so what that means is starting the drug that you're going to use at the same time as the antibiotic so that when you're finally able to stop the antibiotic the other medication is kicked in whether it's spontolactone or topical retinoid that needs eight weeks to really get up to speed or topical classical which means almost a month to get up to speed I'm sorry at 12 months let me say that again 12 weeks to get up to speed it's a it's it's a little bit slow just as sperolactone is right so you need to start everything in the beginning so that when you're ready to stop the antibiotic they have a Fighting Chance yeah do you still use oral antibiotics yeah okay I do I you can't treat acne without it can you and you know it also depends on um on the time for the patient I mean when a patient comes in I'm getting married in two months um prom is in two months and my back is covered of course there's nothing else that's going to make them better in two months and I have no problems putting somebody on an oral antibiotic at that first visit as long as I'm also treating them with the medications that we're going to use for the maintenance phase the trick is to get them off of it as soon as you can and that does not necessarily mean waiting until they're a hundred percent better yeah 50 or 75 percent is probably good enough do you generally do it eight weeks or I generally do it whatever I need to do okay and hopefully that'll be a month it may be eight weeks it it may be three months it may be longer to be honest with you sometimes the patients are doing so well and maybe now the wedding is only three weeks away well of course I'm going to continue right right so so I do use them yes I just try to be I always use them along with benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoid there never is a standalone and you also showed an interesting study about benzoyl peroxide and yeah can you say more about that then so you know it's 60 years old and it's still I I couldn't live without it in acne land um it in its own right it's an excellent treatment for inflammatory lesions of acne and to a lesser extent non-inflammatory lesions um but perhaps more importantly along with either topical or oral antibiotics it prevents the development of resistant organisms so anytime you prescribe a topical or an oral antibiotic benzoyl peroxide should be part of that equation now lots of people say well I'll just throw them a cleanser well cleansers are better than nothing but cleansers at best are about 10 log less good than a Levon benzoyl peroxide at killings the Agnes so better we find a way to give them a leave on than to give them a cleanser but again cleansers are better than nothing mm-hmm and and do you sell it in your office like an over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide I sell nothing in my office I have found that I myself can't handle it yeah I just can't if whenever a patient says should I use this or that and I the medicine calls to me from the closet saying use me sell me I can't do it I I ended up not selling because I felt so uncomfortable about self so I don't do it okay and then it also surprised me when you mentioned brand names versus generic yes do you mind sharing your take on that no I'm I'm a brandaholic and not in everything I mean everybody thinks that I'm a brandaholic for everything because mostly I talk about acne and rosacea but in other conditions I'm not I'm a generic user I wholeheartedly believe in reducing the cost of medical expenses in the United States but rosacea and acne medications are terribly sensitive and these medications are very caustic and unless we find a way to balance tolerability and efficacy we're going to fail and these patients come in to see me who have failed the very same medication they've failed they're a success with me what because I've got like fairy dust that I sprinkle no because I went from a generic to a branded product with a beautiful vehicle that has maintained efficacy in reduced tolerability so guess what they actually used it and they got better because of that so I I just think in acne and rosacea lamb that is very important to have a tolerable product now that might be generic for some people they can tolerate generic versions but not everyone can yeah that was an aha for me but the more I thought about it yeah it does make it friendlier to use on your face exactly especially if you have something inflammatory precisely yeah okay so Switching gears to rosacea tell us your tricks with rosacea do you still do the four quadrants how do you no I spend much less time talking about pathophysiology with rosacea in fact I probably don't talk about it at all I talk about the multi multi-faceted appearance of rosacea and I hand the patient a mirror and have them take a look at themselves with a nice bright light and I say okay so your little red circles and the the your your red on eyes that's probably rosacea you have some pimples over there you have some fixed till injectas here you have some background erythema whatever it is that I say I point out each and every single one of those and I ask them about their symptoms do you burn do you sting your itch so now I have everything that I need to make a comprehensive recommendation for a regimen now that regimen includes making all of that stuff better but the bottom line is that not every patient wants all of those things to be better in general and especially may not want them all to be better when they find out that in order to do that they have to be on two creams a pill and Fork over a couple thousand bucks for a energy based treatment so we point all those things out which one do you care about the most where should we start what else do you want to treat after we've started on that okay treatment of this will require x y and z and it will cost money or it won't cost money and then we move on from there because you need to get the patient buy-in if you have somebody who stings and burns with sad Sac eyes and pimples and erythema that's an expensive proposition for them and it's time consuming it basically is going to be their entire job every day yeah yeah so you need to get their buy-in and not only will it be their job every day but it will be the job every day for years ever right yeah I like that because a lot of patients may want to know they want reassurance I'm not going to get the big nose right you know and maybe they only have the little blood vessels yes you know the big nose is interesting because I've found that it's very important to tell a woman that it's highly unlikely that they're going to get a rhinophyma yes of all the things that I say in my office that moment requires the tissue box more than any other when the woman says oh thank God I thought I was going to look like my Uncle Pete or whatever it is and they actually started to cry because I've told them they're not going to have something they thought they would so it's very important to actually mention that to a woman very rare that they get rhinophyma which is kind of interesting and I don't exactly understand why that is yeah um but yes they you need to inform them about every single aspect of their condition and ask them if they care I've had people who are bright red and they don't even seem to notice much less I can I can make that better my mother looks like this my sister looks like this I always look like this right I know but I mean sometimes it's really really quite Lobster red yeah and they don't care whereas I would care like crazy so again the mirror and asking them what they care about is crucially important what I care about if my face looked like that is completely unimportant that's such a good point all right Medicare patients I know because of the brand names are not heavy covered that's that's incredibly important in in rosacea land especially fortunately we have quite a few products that we can use in our Medicare patient for papules and pustules we can utilize generic antibiotic preparations usually the I I don't like to use full dose antibiotics this is not an infectious condition I don't want to be adding to the issue of antibiotic resistance for a rosacea patient especially but you can usually get 20 milligrams immediate release and 20 milligrams twice a day separated morning and night not together works almost as well as the 40 milligram modified release version of Doxycycline um Ivermectin now is uh generic and usually relatively affordable so those two are my go-to okay that's a good tip do you ever do over-the-counter sofa wash or prescription sofa wash no to you I'm not on this not on this no I never do I don't find them to be particularly helpful yeah but you know I also I'm an old lady that's all we've had when I was starting out in dermatology and then they disappeared because they didn't work very well and then I'm not sure why but they came back seems like it's something to offer but well yes slightly better than nothing well that's exactly it and if I'm making a recommendation for a product because it's either that or I have to say there's nothing I can do for you yeah you know that's not exactly a rousing endorsement um and I imagine I would in that situation because I hate to say I can't help you okay what about the correlation with the gut do you get that question all the time I do indeed but not for my patients it hasn't seemed at least in my experience with my patient population hasn't hit mainstream yet for them but I'm asked it all the time by colleagues I do think that there is a relationship in some patients it's not common enough to for me to necessarily query my patients as to whether or not they have gut issues I have put in my intake form though a more comprehensive gut question so it used to be just sort of do you have any GI issues and now it's it's more specific to bloating and gas and constipation and diarrhea and I've been much more specific about it and I do glance at that and if it's a positive review of systems then I'll discuss it but you know we have a limited amount of time to care for our patients and education is so important I don't want to bring up a subject where I have no answer and bring open up a can of worms that are going that's going to end up taking time away from something that is perhaps more important yeah so only in the patient where there's an actual rationale for doing so and the psychology of acne and rosacea is can already be hard enough and then if you throw on top of that this may be your fault because of what you're eating that is where you apply that such a great statement that I could not agree with you more every time we say that you're not drinking enough water my personal favorite or you have acne because you drink eat junk food or you have rosacea because you drink red wine we're putting the blame on the patient and could that possibly be a trigger I guess so but quality of life matters as well yes and blaming a patient for their own disease is just dirty pool yeah I agree all right lastly tell me about how do you get to the root of how much a patient's acne really bothers them like what kind of questions do you ask you have great questions I have to say I've never been asked these great questions before I ask every acne patient on a scale of one to ten one being what acne and ten being I Come From Brooklyn you remember that part right 10 being get this crap off my face or I'm going to stab you I literally say those words you can change it to whatever you like change it to whatever you like or whatever works in your neighborhood that works in Brooklyn um and how do you feel about your acne and um my opinion is that if they are below five we've got ourselves a problem because it's highly unlikely that they're going to be adherent to even one treatment much less the 2.53 that I want them to use I think it's also sometimes interesting to separately ask Mom the same question that's a good point mom is frequently at 10 when the kids at two yeah sometimes the opposite occurs mother is just doesn't care I had acne when I was a kid I got over it you will too and it doesn't even make it to a radar screen whereas the child usually in that situation a young woman perhaps with body dysmorphic disorder is at a 10 even though she only has a couple of pimples so it's a very important question to ask to see where they are um and if they're about to tip over the edge you know I mean people who are at 10 for example and have three papules are in trouble that is a good point too right so that that simple question really helps you to decide whether they're going to be adherent to therapy how many treatments you can use how fast the medication needs to work how crucial it is to make the patient better as fast as possible people and whether or not you need to intervene with a very very big disconnect between Mom and the child yeah yeah excellent advice thank you so much Dr Baldwin my pleasure this has been a lot of fun thank you hope cook signing off for durhamcast TV [Music]",

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can check it out also if you want to Deep dive on information about any of these skin conditions you can actually search Cassandra Banks and rosacea or Cassandra bankson sunburn or Cassandra bankson skin condition in the YouTube search bar and we've probably done a video on it specifically if you search Cassandra bankson how to treat a sunburn I've shared with you some of my best tips and tricks as well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this next video love you guys hey",

        "transcript": "probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea the first one is actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds I'm Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to Pillow Talk durm where we meet every Saturday morning to expand your brain and mind in the process if you have no idea who I am subscribe so you know what's good for you but I am a board certified dermatologist and today we are going to be focusing on rosacea because it is the last weekend of rosacea awareness month and I've taken pity on you flushed red human beings out there so we're going to focus on how to better identify your rosacea and help yourself but before I do that make sure you head on over to d r ris.com because I am starting a new newsletter that's going out every week that is purely educational focused from Dr eris.com so we'll be recapping some of the YouTubes we'll be focusing on new topics if you guys have questions make sure to email us at hello.com and we will make sure to incorporate those questions into that newsletter every week so head on over there I will link it below on the screen so back to rosacea what is it what causes it how do you identify it we're going to get in right now rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition it is not acne and I have to start off by saying this because as a Derm I get so annoyed when I see the marketing around ingredients for rosacea as acne but I understand why they do this and I'm going to let you guys in on something take for example sulfur which we're going to talk about in this video in order to get a drug fact label on a sulfur product so you can have a quote unquote medical indication for that ingredient you have to abide by what the FDA sees that ingredient fit for sulfur has traditionally been approved by the FDA for acne so they often write for example on sulfur purpose acne treatment and that's huge for a brand that they can actually say that so they're going to go ahead and run with it but sulfur is traditionally great for rosacea and not necessarily acne so I think in the process the public has gotten confused and started confusing the two and treating rosacea like acne but that is probably the worst thing you can do because it can disrupt your Skin Barrier more and it can inflame your rosacea worse in the process but I wanted you guys to understand this very nuanced thing so that you know as a person that rosacea is truly not acne it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is due to a multitude of different things we actually don't know exactly why you get it we do believe there is a genetic predisposition when you think of Rosa you think of a white person who gets really red but do not assume that darker skin tones can't have rosacea either it is just harder to detect and see but they can absolutely have rosacea too and it's usually due to a multitude of different factors from genetics chronic heat UV exposure a broken Skin Barrier little tiny mites like these called Demodex mites that are just going rampid on your skin we all have them some of us have them a little bit more than others and when they wake up and they're alive they tend to just mess up but deodex mites an overabundance of reactivity in terms of flushing etc etc etc and when you have a little bit of everything The Perfect Storm can show up on your face when you're nervous when you're stressed when you're hot when you're eating spicy foods when you're on a date you name it but there are really if you want to take a step back four main types of rosacea starting with the most common emodal ectatic rosacea Arial means red tantic means blood vessels rosesa is rosesa so when you have somebody who's red with a lot of broken blood vessels all over their face they have one of the most common forms known as the athematic type then you have the one that I think people get confused by that they confuse with adult acne papulo pular rosacea papules and P little red bumps and little tiny bumps all over your face usually along the cheeks the nose maybe a little bit here can sometimes happen along the chin interesting tip and this one's a good one you do not have blackheads in rosacea and with rosacea the nasal labial folds this area is spared so if you're having all of a sudden a breakout right here around your mouth it's probably not rosacea if it affects your nasal laal folds then you have the the third type which is like your old white uncle that you just can't or maybe you love or you just don't really like I don't know maybe I'm projecting but you have Fus rosacea where when you have chronic inflammation right and enlarged sweat glands the skin can appear thicker and your pores can look enlarged and your nose starts to get really distended and honestly deformed over time it can happen to your nose it can happen to your chin it can happen to your forehead that's the Fus type then the fourth type is ocular rosacea which people often Overlook completely but the eyes are usually affected in 50% of rosacea sufferers and what do you get with that you get blefaritis so inflammation along the eyelid margins you can get redness of the white part of your eye you have to take an eye hygiene into consideration but also when your eyes are affected and they're chronically inflamed especially the lid margins you want to calm that inflammation down so you don't f up your eyeballs in the process and have scratches on your corneil so that's usually an oral medication and that's why you shouldn't be scared of going on systemic medications but you should probably also see an opthalmologist and let them know about it so how can you then help yourself first without going into any sort of over-the-counter products or even prescription medications or in office treatments there's lifestyle and the things associated with lifestyle you're not going to like but this is the hard truth hot showers no steam no all of you weirdos love Hot Yoga that Take 5 hours to go in and out to actually do I tried doing it one year and I died no we don't do hot yoga spicy food I mean everything in moderation okay every once in a while it's fine but if you're going to eat like chili peppers with every meal you're going to mess up your Rosa alcohol caffeine chocolate a lot of chocolate can affect stress yes we need to start meditating in the morning certain medications the list goes on and on and on so you really do have to start listening to your skin and understanding how you're reacting to certain triggers whether it is sitting out in the sun or going into a hot yoga room or doing a steam or a sauna etc etc cooking maybe it's a perfect excuse for you not to cook and so you guys get the gist right make it work to your benefit so what are then the top ingredients that we can incorporate into our routine if we have rosacea and we're trying to help ourselves and I'm going to look for things that are calming and soothing that are going to help restore our Skin Barrier that are going to reduce inflam and that are basically Beyond The Gentle basic skin care that we think of when we think of basic sensitive skin like Cal oatmeal panol Etc glycerin we want to look for ingredients that are going to actively help reduce the look of that is the correct way of saying it if you are in the industry because you can't claim that it's reducing inflammation it's helping reduce the look of inflammation and redness number one and this is probably the most popular one on the market that I think a lot of Ros of people know about and look for directly Santella atica Santella atica is known for redness reducing properties anti-inflammatory properties it has atico sdes medas aides and aziatic acid in it which all have anti-inflammatory effects and it reduces the look of inflammation it has been shown also just side note to promote collagen production so and it also has certain antioxidants that can protect the skin from the damage caused by free radicals obviously full disclosure my brand the depuffer why do I love this product if you have rosacea because it is loaded in centella asiatica but it also has arnica and arnica is not one that is traditionally thought of for rosacea but it works like a charm because it helps reduce the redness and calms the inflammation in a synergistic way that your skin looks def flushed within a couple of minutes when done correctly at the right concentration arnica is tricky though because when you guys look for arnica products more often than not they're diluted in a homeopathic fashion this one is purely Brown because it is pure arnica the color that you guys see here this golden hue is due to the high concentration of arnica in this formulation then you have one that a lot of people with rosacea know about Dr jart Dr jart has his tiger grass which is another name for cantella asiatica color correcting treatment it's a mineral sunscreen with zinc and titanium and it has a green tint to it and a more opaque fashion versus this that is going to help neutralize the look of redness because when you're red you want green to block the red we're not going to go into the art of it take an art course that's not my jam although I do like painting number two we have sulfur I hinted at sulfur at the beginning of this video sulfur is going to be marketed as an acne treatment I.E like on this when you see eradicate daily foaming cleanser acne treatment because it has 3% sulfur but it's not really just an acne treatment it's a rosacea treatment why because sulfur helps to minimize inflammation it regulates seen production a lot of people with rosacea have a lot of overproduced seim think of the nose think of the chin and it also helps to minimize inflammation as well it has antimicrobial properties which is helpful right but not the main reason of why it works and it has mild exfoliating properties but it's not going to over strip you and Break Your Skin Barrier worse making your rosacea flare up in the process there's another product by pieter Thomas Roth they have a 10% sulfur clay mask which is much more potent than the cleanser form and then you have one available at your local drugstore called Dela Cruz where you can literally spend a couple of bucks smell like a rotten egg and improve your skin in the process so those are the sulfur products that are high up at number two when it comes to ingredients number three is AAL acid AAL acid is an ingredient that I have a honestly more of a love love relationship with a little bit of a hate because it's not elegant it pills and it messes up a formula when you mix it with other actives at the right% and in order to use aoic acid if you have rosacea you really want to be at 10% or above but above that is prescription and prescription is 15% which is sweet spot and I don't know how the prescription is formulated but it's so elegant finaa is so elegant and I do not get paid by that drug company whatsoever um but it's a 15% prescription on to over the- counter though we have paa choice this is a 10% AIC acid booster I believe um it has a little bit of licorice it does have salicylic acid I don't know the percent of Sal acid in this if you're sensitive or you think your barrier is inflamed beware don't go for it because the Sal acid might mess you up but AIC acid like I said regul Ates your anti-inflammatory properties and antibacterial properties and it helps as an antioxidant as well Dr Sam bunting across the pond in the UK has her Flawless nightly serum which is a 10% aoic acid serum as well it has 5% niacinamide it does have a Ester form of vitamin C at 2% so it's not going to be the active form of vitamin C but it might be a nice one if you are a rosacea sufferer trying to use vitamin see in the morning wanting to get away with some AIC acid I hear beautiful things I started looking into it because of you guys dming me about it so that is hers and then the ordinary this one's great at night when you have nowhere to go and you don't care who you're seeing it is a 10% a acid suspension you do kind of sometimes have to shake it I feel but it appears nice and elegant but it does pill after a while so do not be fooled by the first impression with this it's 11 bucks though so you not really go wrong and then like I said prescription number four hypochlorous acid you guys have started hearing about this all over Instagram Tik Tok YouTube I don't know what else you guys are on I can't keep up with the social media platforms but hypochlorous acid is one that has been used in medicine for decades I actually use it before every cosmetic procedure to clean my patients faces because it has antimicrobial effects and it is gentle so it's not going to over strip their skin like using plain oil isopropyl alcohol or an alcohol wipe it is now available in fancier forms at nicer stores but you can also get it at your local drugstore as a generic this is one that is available at Walgreens it is really not that expensive at all and you can use it every day on your face in the morning and at night if you're somebody who wears a mask for whatever reason at the height of the pandemic I used to spray my mask with hypoc chloris acid to minimize the breakout around the mouth area number five this is one that people don't often think of when they have rosacea a lot of people with rosacea think they have chronically dry skin over here it's always flaking but then when I ask my patients is your skin dry or oily they go it's more oily but it flakes okay it's not dry skin it's not flaking because it's dry it is a yeast living on your skin and you have dandruff of your face a lot of rosacea patients have dandruff of their face around their eyebrows right here in the corners of their nose or even along their eyelid margins and you can even see it sometimes in front of their ears and they need ketoconazol neral shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp that you can use a couple of times a week on your face to keep that yeast at Bay okay um it's an anti-fungal medicine that can help really help your face and I think when that is sort of subsided and you calm the subar dermatitis down you minimize the inflammation associated with it and your redness gets better in the long run so this is something that you're going to have to incorporate throughout the course of your life and you have to figure out the Cadence of how you want to incorporate it the shampoo is not necessarily the best as a face wash because it's not the ideal pH it might be a little bit stripping but if you use it several times periodically maybe twice a week maybe it's four times a week maybe it's once a week I don't know what the right Cadence is for you and you do it in the areas that are actually the worst letting it sit for a few minutes before washing it off you will see a huge difference in your skin in the long run also just side note I use the shampoo right here I've been using it right here when I wash my hair I let it sit for 5 minutes not because I have dandruff but because I have thinning hair there and I have noticed that my hair is starting to get thicker poor AI okay number six benzil peroxide and you're going to go wait wait wait wait wait is benzil peroxide and adne medication yes it is is it great for rosacea no it's not but if you have this little Mite called a Demodex Mite out of control on your face then benzil peroxide can be helpful for you now not all rosacea people have Demodex mites going crazy on their face but a lot of them do and the way I hear it described from my patients is that they feel like their skin is a little bit reactive and itchy not painful not irrit ated but just like this is probably the get your mind out of the gutter okay but this is probably the best action I can describe it as okay but benzil peroxide can help kill it now you don't need a 10% benzil peroxide wash stronger isn't better something like at 5% we have this in my office is great it's going to help kill that bacteria the little mites and keep it at Bay all right FYI because of the drug fact label benzil peroxide comes up as acne but this can be helpful for Demodex mites as well okay number seven my favorite zinc oxide no it's not sunscreen I'm talking about diaper rash cream Triple Paste zinc oxide is a beautiful ingredient it has anti-inflammatory effects when a kid has a rash down there you slap this all over their little tushies in a gentle way in order to minimize their rash to calm the inflammation down so they have less friction Etc on their privates when it comes to your face if you have an inflamed Skin Barrier and you're trying to restore your barrier zinc oxide can really help restore that barrier and when it comes in the form of a diaper rash cream when it's married to petrolatum it will help create an occlusive layer while calming any inflammation down and it works wonders as an overnight mask treatment especially in a dry climate or in a very cold climate or when the temperatures are changing not all diaper rash creams are created equal don't go for one with essential oils definitely don't and make sure there's no steroid in it cuz that can make things worse I was sponsored by this company after I spoke about them it was a very organic thing and that's why I took that sponsorship because I was like how funny Would it be that the one sponsorship I'm excited about is a buttpaste company but this is probably my favorite one not because of that sponsorship I have two kids who are six and four I wasn't sponsored then but this was the one that I used on my kids so that is the diaper rash cream k for that and then we're going to talk about options for quickly prescriptions but we're not going to waste too much time on this because you can't prescribe medications for yourselves at least not as of yet but who knows what the future holds but aik acid 15% that's great you want to incorporate that metronidazol is a topical antibiotic that you guys can use it's been very well studied for rosacea it is also beautiful and santra which is the trade name the generic name is itin is an antiparasitic that also kills Demodex I often times prescribe all three and I tell patients go plop ploop ploop put three dots mix mix mix apply to face twice a day and it really does help a lot with people with rosacea to help keep all of it at Bay and you can use this long term you can use aoic acid when you're pregnant you can use metronidazol when you're pregnant and last I checked you can use cilantro when you're pregnant in office we can take it up a notch and you guys can really help yourselves by reducing the Cosmetic look of redness by getting the beams vascular laser beams also pulse known as the pulse die laser which in my book is the gold standard you guys might get Groupon deals for ipls or bbls for rosacea it doesn't work as well an IPL and a BBL is a light it is not a laser you're going to need a lot more treatments and you better be going to somebody who is qualified because you might get burnt in the process because they are not as specific as a laser and you need to know what you're doing with them in order to treat your rosacea correctly and then if you have enlarged sweat glands on your nose or on your chin you can do electr surgery you can shave it down people actually use sandpaper believe it or not in conjunction with other devices and lasers to help minimize the look of that but you're probably not watching this video I am assuming if that is your case and you have timeus changes on your nose um because it's usually older white men who get that so I don't think they're watching this YouTube um but that is pretty much what we can do the bird ey view in office and the last thing I want to just say is rosacea might appear like a very benign chronic condition but it has a really deep psychological influence and psychosocial impact on people knowing that you're flushing when you're embarrassed makes you more embarrassed and makes it worse as somebody who has had 10 V beams in one year yes 10 why because I would go to the gym and I would get stopped on the street when I was working out and they would ask me do you need to go to the hospital are you okay cuz I looked like a beat I wasn't red I was like purple red and so I told myself let me just treat this with the vbm and I ended up doing 10 one year and I maintain it probably with one or two treatments a year now I treat my whole face it is really psychologically draining thinking oh my God are my emotions showing on my face and my ears so don't just down for rosacea awareness month and if you guys have any questions or comments as always leave them below but I hope you have a beautiful Saturday [Music]",

        "transcript": "one of the big things I like to talk to people about is like let's get you to move into action through something that's transformative and so that's why I'm really excited to talk to you today because number one you did this for yourself because you had rosacea for 20 years and you healed it within four months and now you help people from all over the world and have helped people from all over the world do the same thing [Music] without further Ado Dr Tara Odessa I'm so excited to have you with me today can you introduce yourself tell a little bit about your background tell about your story um anything that you'd like to share to let people know who you are and and what you were dealing with with rosacea this is your time to to get people into your work um yeah it's fascinating to say I never thought my life would take this turn to be sitting here with you talking about rosacea out you know to the whole world but um I developed rosacea when I was about 25 and went to the dermatologist just like everyone does got some topical um antibiotics some oral antibiotics oh come back in three months of course it's not gone and then you know year after year it tends to get progressively worse and so every year I'd go back to the dermatologist are there new medications what am I supposed to be doing I notice it flares when I eat certain foods and they'd really be very dismissive about any sort of connection to food or anything well well it's not curable you're going to deal with this the rest of your life and I'd always leave and sit in my car and cry and say like how bad is this gonna get it becomes um you know over time it can be actually um deformative and disfiguring and I would look at pictures of older people with you know the bulbous noses and go gosh like I'm only 25 what's it going to be like when I'm 45 and um try to kind of push it away and eventually I got to the point after having two kids and going through like hormonal changes and and having these massive flare-ups where my skin was just um so purply red to the point where I'd walk no matter where I went if I went into a pizza shop if I went into a target people would come up to me and say are you okay do you need water people thought I was having a heart attack 24 7 and I just posted this picture on my Instagram of me when I think it was around my 40th birthday and just looking at my face and this was after having put tons and tons of foundation on and and the color of my face is that purpley be red and it was chronically like that and so you know I'd have patience sitting in front of me and I'm doing an exam on them and they're saying to me are you okay do you need water and so you know it got to the point I was like gosh like I've got to figure this out I have got to figure this out what is causing this why is my health deteriorating I'm a healthy person I know about nutrition I know about amazing healthy supplements like how how can I fix this and I just started researching and researching I really felt like it was connected to my gut because it had such poor gut health for so long and when I noticed that um when I would be really sick and I wouldn't eat for a few days my skin would clear up so I was like okay there it's got to be connected somehow to that um I also started learning a lot about liver and how your liver can kind of build up toxins and I had a ton of toxic as exposures as a kid like to smoke and then to formaldehyde and to dry cleaning chemicals um and these these tend to pile up in your liver especially if your gut is compromised so your your gut can't absorb the nutrients that your liver needs to detoxify so it's it looking back it was I was very much set up to developerization I just didn't know why and so This research Journey took me through the connection between skin and gut and then the mind and the emotions and I just started working relentlessly on um you know gut healing and liver detoxifying and spleen health and emotions and I I got to a point where I was pretty much rosacea free after several months I could go out with a friend and have a glass of wine and zero flare up zero flushing my skin completely changed textures while I had type 2 where you really have that like orange peel you can when you look at someone up close you can see this um like texture and it's usually covered in bumps it's like an acne rosacea so all of that completely went away I was so dumbfounded I kept saying over and over to everyone like how is this possible how did this go away everything I read says it's incurable and yet when you do all these things it actually can go away and I just felt the need to share this with anyone who was desperately trying to resolve their rosation so I put it on a website and put it out to the universe and people started contacting me and here we are today and I've built a program so that it walks people through these steps that you take it gives them very specific guidance because the the whole dietary thing people are so confused about they're they're being told to avoid very specific foods that are actually very healing food so it becomes kind of this Minefield of what am I supposed to eat I can't eat anything I just won't eat anything and so anyway um here we are and I'm very happy to continue to to share this knowledge of people how long ago was that that you had that four month journey and we're like it's working so it started December 2019 um I think that was kind of like the the downfall I was at work and one of the AIDS the medical AIDS came up to me and kind of like screamed like what's wrong with your face and this is in a room a waiting room full of patience and I was horrified because I was like how am I supposed to go to work and present myself at work and people are looking up to me to help them when clearly there's something wrong here um and I that was it I was like I'm done I will not let this go and every night I would stay up till three in the morning just reading PubMed like research research research what is this connection um and then you know starting early 2020 was when I started to see changes especially to my gut health where I wasn't waking up with a stomachache every day and um come to find out I had Celiac I only found out I had Celiac four months ago so it turns out I had it my entire life and never knew um so that's that was a big part of the puzzle for me um was when I actually eliminated gluten and realized that my gut could start to heal and so that was the first amount of progress I saw but I had so much um Mercury toxicity and heavy metal toxicity that the gluten alone would never have healed rosacea there were other things that I had to do to actively remove these things how did you find out about because I've heard I think maybe you said this in our previous interview as well that you had had some testing done and it was coming back saying that you were fine you didn't have allergens um so how did you and how are you able to find out about the toxicity that was happening inside of your body and um it seems like recently finding out about Celiac yeah so it had blood work done about 10 years ago and they did Celiac testing and they said it's fine you know you don't have to do a biopsy everything's fine and then of course when I did it four months ago they were like well it's it's unlikely but let's just do the biopsy just in case and of course when they did the biopsy they said oh you absolutely have Celiac so that was a shocker and and I'm really you know after several years of doing this with people I'm not a fan of testing because so many times the testing is not accurate so people will and then I also did um like food allergy testing with Everly well which is like a panel and they test blood and came back like nothing you're not allergic to anything so I was like all right well there's that and then the heavy metals was not a test now there are tests you can do there's like um hair strand testing you can do but again I've met with people who did the testing and said oh it's not heavy metals it's not Mercury I did testing and when we put them on a specific cleanse for mercury or four heavy metals they get better so I've seen it too often so I no longer rely on testing I don't do testing I don't like testing I go by symptoms and having had so many silver fillings or amalgams since I was like seven years old I knew that mercury was going to be an issue for me so try the testing it's I everything I do now is based on symptoms yeah I completely forgot I've been hearing a lot recently about um those metal fillings and crap I have a crown that couldn't withhold uh from whatever they build build around it so they actually had to put a metal stud in it and so you know I'm starting to hear things about that I'm like oh great my mouth is filled well yeah you want to know what type of metal is that stud and um for for people who have metal fillings I would highly recommend going to a holistic dentist and having them safely removed there's a method that they'll use called the smart method that will remove it so that you're not inhaling the Mercury Vapors and that can be really chain life-changing for many people they see a difference right away why do you think so many dermatologists and maybe it's because they're skin doctors and experts but why do you think so many of them I hear from people who have rosacea that say they that there's no cure for this or they're trying to put me on medications and it might get better for a little bit and then it doesn't get better and then they put me on something else do you think it's just the lack of knowledge and outside of their expertise or or um have you ever heard of dermatologists recommending people to Specialists who uh could talk about gut health uh no I really I think it's what they're being taught in medical school it's not it's not their fault um it takes 17 years for current research to actually make it into practice so what they're learning in medical school is this poor person has this terrible skin redness we can help them by giving them this antibiotics that's what they're being taught here's your disease here's your medication it's very rare for traditional medical schools to dive into the why and the the underlying factors and naturopathic doctors um any sort of functional medicine doctor chiropractors they have a ton of Education in that field of let's let's not put a Band-Aid on it let's figure out what's going on internally to cause it and so um I don't think it's the dermatologist's fault at all I just think they're not educated in that and you know they have a lot of drugs reps coming in and talking about new medications and that's kind of the that's kind of where they are and then if someone asked about diet they they're like I don't really know you know maybe you should ask a dietitian like they're it's just not something that they're um educated in and something that they're comfortable even talking about it kind of cuts off at that but yeah we're gonna go beyond the surface they're literally uh trained to look at the surface look at the skin right under the skin and and go off of the education that they've been provided with so that I guess that would make sense but I just hear so many people that they go see a dermatologist even um with flushing and blushing sometimes people go and they get diagnosed with rosacea and they're they have flare-ups with anxious situations and I know that you had shared in the past that even for you with rosacea if there was an anxious moment going on that it would flare up and have that similar flesh or blush appearance absolutely that would happen all even with my um Baseline redness if I ate certain foods or if I had to speak in public or if I was having a talk with someone and I was starting to feel anxious I would immediately go into like you know fire engine red like I mean and it was and then the person is like well what's going on here are you okay you know then we go through the whole do you need to sit down issue and yeah it's so in many people with rosacea will have that um emotional flare up as well as special reactions to alcohol or certain foods or sunlight or there's a whole list of things they'll react to that's very similar to what I was experiencing with flushing and some people that I hear that have a lot of the facial blushing is that they would say that the sun would create a reaction anxious moments really create the reaction do you um for you in particular you've mentioned a few times like people calling it out and saying things about it which is a huge thing in the blushing Phoenix community and how people usually wind up finding me is that they have a moment where somebody they're tired of people calling it out how for you in your career at that time and just being able to continue to show up or speak what was your driving force or how did you continue to put yourself out in the public eye knowing that people were going to say something and like the emotional impact that that can have on somebody how did you handle those things I think in a way I'm kind of glad that this happened when I was in my my mid-40s because I think if I was 25 and this was happening it would have completely shut me down but having two kids and needing a paycheck and needing to keep up with life and at that point my focus was not on myself it was on my kids and what you know providing for them and being a great mom so luckily I was out of that stage of life where you're really hyper focused on your appearance and like you know that's kind of like your your 20 but then it's like everything changes right you have kids and then it's that becomes your world so as much as I needed to be professional and show up at work um I was going to go to work no matter what and if people said something they said something I just I needed to show up and be there but I was dead set on I'm going to figure this out like I will not let this go dermatologists have never helped me this is not a skin issue this is something else and I will figure this out yeah I think it's funny because I'm 38 so I have kind of gone through and I didn't start having flushing happening to me until around 2017 so I was in the right at the beginning of starting to advance in my career and that's actually when it started getting really bad for me because I think I was so much closer to those authoritative leadership elements and I needed to be perceived a certain way in my world I thought in order to be able to continue to gradually climb that ladder and I and it felt like oh my gosh they're gonna they're gonna think I'm incompetent and I won't be able to do any I'm lacking confidence so that's when I started to really hide and I've seen people who when I have talked to women especially that are either in their 40s or in their 50s there's um there is another doctor that I talked to her name is Dr Madeline and she I believe she's in Brussels she did a tedx talk about blushing how she overcame her blushing and she's in her 50s and it's so interesting to hear just from the different spectrums of Ages because she is in that space now of um she's she's done the career thing she's doing her own thing now and she said she realized that when her blushing stopped was when she was in like a group setting like doing a project of some sort and she thought about the team and how she could help the team and her Focus got off of herself and I've realized even for myself over the past couple of years I can be in a room with people and I'm like well I was actually listening to them I wasn't just focused on like me me you know that kind of cycle of like what's happening with me and what are people thinking about me and they're literally not thinking about you because they're so busy thinking about themselves that the last thing anybody's doing is thinking about you and I think for younger people I just talked to somebody the other day who's in his early 20s and I'm gonna interview him in the near future and I think he's going to be able to really talk to such a group that I can't always talk to because I just it didn't happen in my adolescence right and I can't even imagine especially with social media 20 year olds coming up today in the you know early 30 year olds I I feel terrible for them because I didn't live that I mean I was 20 you know 20 almost 30 years ago and there wasn't there was no internet I don't even think um you know you were face to face with people and they could comment but nobody was you weren't comparing yourself on social media you weren't you know brushing up your appearance like I feel so bad look you scroll through Instagram and nobody's real like these faces none of it's real it's all touched up and having to compare yourself to that I cannot even imagine with um you know a 20-something who is trying to fit in trying to find their career path wanting to show up and look good and then worrying about am I going to turn red am I going to flush is my skin gonna be breaking out it's just it's very stressful and and I feel terrible for people going through that do you have for people who who reach out to you is there like a broad range of Ages is it male and female is it like what's the the um who normally is reaching out to you it's interesting because the the typical age Von said is getting much lower now when I was diagnosed at 25 the dermatologist said I was the youngest patient should ever had with rosacea and the typical age then was in the late 40s so now we're seeing it I mean the majority of people that I see are probably in their 20s um I've had teens who who've developed it 14 15 year olds um who've had amazing success in reversing it early on which is fantastic um but I I just think that as we're exposed to more and more toxins in our environment in our food in our water in our air it's no surprise that um people cannot detox by the way they did even 20 years ago because I everyone's eating fast food and you know then you go back to gut health and everyone's very anxious these days like look at the teens and all the anxiety and depression and a lot of it is social media but um unfortunately I feel like a lot of these health conditions in general are coming on much much earlier than than we were seeing 20 years ago yeah and do you do you find that um these people are showing up at your doorstep so to speak in from the the physical appearance are they having pain what what are uh typical symptoms for somebody with rosacea that kind of gets them to that Breaking Point um of being like I've got to get it something I've got to get help from somewhere else yeah as a dermatologist um because it's Progressive if you let it go long enough it does become pain I was in his I was definitely in that state where I would I would be in pain when I would have a full-on flush it becomes neurogenic and you actually are in pain um and so that the longer that progresses the harder that is servers it can reverse but it just takes longer um and I'm seeing a lot of people with ocular rosacea that's also kind of a subtype but it's something you developed so I would always I had ocularization I didn't know I would always go to the eye doctor and my eyes are so dry my eyes are red and itchy when I wake up is it my contacts and they would just give me re-wetting drops that's all I ever got and it turns out it was ocular rosacea which is intertwined with facial rosacea and in many cases and also can be reversed um but people just don't know this are not aware of this they're not being told this and um there's just so much that can be done for these people do do when we have the redness on the face um not the below the surface stuff and the gut health but just on the surface is that just dilation of blood vessels what's actually happening that's creating the redness yeah that's that's blood rushing into your face into your neck and chest often um and so it's it's almost like an it's like a sensitive or an allergic reaction almost that um now that's that's like when you experience um an emotion or food or something if you're chronically red yes that's also from just these um overworked or overused um it's a vascular thing and people with rosacea you often see broken blood vessels because those blood vessels have been um Extended and almost like swollen or enlarged for so long that they eventually burst yeah and I've seen so when I heard some of your story and you were talking about where you started in diet you realize that it was something that's going to be below the surface it's not going to be skin this is not working what was your kind of first step in in because when you talk about it from a high level view it's like okay we've got some liver stuff we've got some gluten stuff what was your first step of going let me try this out and and how was it when you started to realize like this is working and how how soon did you realize it was working I think the first thing I did was no gluten no Dairy because I had just been reading so much about gut health and that those can be so inflammatory to people now meanwhile I'm thinking I don't have Celiac and I had previously tried eliminating gluten and nothing had changed but I had only eliminated it for like a week or two and then I was like this is too hard and it's not working but it's interesting because gluten is one of those things it's actually the only food that cannot be broken down fully so it ends up staying in your gut almost like plastic and just going round and round and round while your gut is desperately trying to break it down so they they feel like gluten can stay in your body for about seven to ten days after you've consumed it it can get into your brain it can do all sorts of things even for people who are not sensitive to gluten so doing them together the dairy and the gluten really started to I started to have less flare-ups and I started to have less bumps and I was like okay like this actually might I might be on to something and then continued you know like what else is going on what can I do to actually heal your gut a lot of people focus on gut healing but if you're actively trying to heal your gut now I had tried like supplements like gut healing supplements that did absolutely nothing because I was still eating inflammatory foods so the supplements weren't being broken down weren't being absorbed so when you kind of put it all together um a combination of eliminating the right foods and then including the right foods and you do that for a solid month that's when people start to see progress and then you really have to start doing that inner work that we kind of talked about um so much of this is emotional you've gotta dig deep and kind of figure out what else is going on you know what are you holding on to what are you angry about um there's a lot there and for for some people that is a much bigger thing than the dietary part of it so yeah so there's like a whole bucket of stuff that that will eventually cause rosacea and it's different for everyone but usually doing one thing like Lemonade gluten can possibly get you started but it's not going to be the end-all when people come to you and they are like help me what do you offer to them courses workshops one-on-one what does that look like what do you have to offer so I did do one-on-ones for a long time um I think in like 2021 I started doing those and they were great for people but what I soon realized was that I didn't want to just tell people what to do I wanted them to understand what was going on because after a month they would come running back and say okay well now I'm reading this label and I don't know if I can buy this or not and what should I do next and I realized that it would be much more helpful to actually educate them which I couldn't do in an hour um so I put together a whole bunch of videos and um you know almost like classwork so that people could begin to be educated on their gut and liver so that when they go to the grocery store they know what they're doing they know what to choose they're not having to reach out and so I feel like the course has actually been much more effective than the one-on-ones because I was kind of telling people the same thing over and over and realizing that it would be like could help more people if it was put together in a program and so um so I no longer do one-on-ones for that reason and I just continued to add to the course so that so many as more things come up such as parasites and lymphatic system and all these other issues that a lot of people with rosacea are also dealing with that they can get help for that as well that's incredible and do people through the course are they able to get like a dietary plan um to get them started or is that something that has to be more customized custom as they go on or do you just see very similar results across the board yeah so um when you join the program it's it's a six-week program but we do a one month cleanse protocol so everyone is typically following the same cleanse protocol um they may need some guidance from their own doctor because I am not able to give a specific guidance to anyone because it's a it's an individual educational program but the the bones are there so that they can read that and do what they will and follow it and at the end of the month they kind of have a decision of like what was most helpful what what am I going to do forever I mean personally I will forever be taking a probiotic every day because I realize how amazingly beneficial it is in so many ways because I'm not eating an extremely diverse diet I try to but you know I'm barely home so you know there are certain things that I'll always do um and most people after that month will come back and say wow like this is amazing I no longer have gas and bloating I'm no longer constipated this is amazing and then they they want us to continue certain elements of it and that's when they can then start to focus on things like spleen and things like heavy metals and all other things that are going on with them so then we talk about all that in the in the future um modules awesome so for the probiotics what I know there's a lot I hear a lot of controversy around probiotics from your perspective what is the most effective probiotic what are people looking for when they are trying to find a really good probiotic okay so the problem with probiotics is that if you have something like sibo and you've heard oh I'm supposed to take probiotics and you go and take a probiotic there's a chance that that probiotic could actually make your symptoms a lot worse because sibo is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so you actually have an overgrowth of bacteria and now you're going to give yourself a probiotic which is going to add more bacteria to that so it's again like this Minefield like people will hear chatter oh you should take a probiotic and they'll go to Target and buy the number one selling probiotic on the market and they'll take it and and they don't know if it's working or not but they're just going to take it because they think they should so we don't use that probiotic we have a very specific probiotic that's a soil based probiotic that is effective whether or not you have sibo no matter what kind of gut issue and and that's the the beginning of the probiotic so like you would you would do that initially and then you would focus on gut healing and you know maybe a few months down the line when your gut can tolerate more that's when you would start to introduce some more strains that will not cause a terrible reaction if you were to have sibo you're kind of getting to a baseline And so right so you're going to get your body to a baseline to be able to even start to figure out if you're feeling good things are looking good and you take something and you start getting these flare-ups again then you'll know exactly but it's important to Elimination Diet and you're starting to add things back in right exactly very similar yeah but I I do feel like you know I a lot of people come in and they say uh I don't eat anything I did this diet I did this diet they did three or four diets previously to coming to me and they're only eating like lettuce and um I don't know rice and they're just terrified of food because everything they eat gives them a flare-up and so food fear is is a major problem um and so when most people do my program they're like oh my God this is amazing I can eat so many foods that I thought I couldn't eat so that's been great for people to realize that you don't have to be afraid of spices and colorful foods and they're amazing foods and and you just have to you know be able to know which ones you can start to include yeah and I think it's the little Joys from food that we forget about because even for like personally recovering from covid I lost my taste and smell it's been gone for quite a few days now and it's like the world is so gray you cannot taste or smell or enjoy Foods yeah it's I know we love food we love social interactions with food and sitting with a friend and having dessert and and my whole program is not about living in a restrictive State it's about healing so that you can have coffee and you can have cake with your friend and you can you know unless of course you're like me and you have Celiac but aside from gluten I pretty much eat every other thing out there I go out with friends I can drink alcohol and and I can live a normal life now because I've healed so it's absolutely possible for anyone I don't want anyone to ever think like you can heal but then you you're going to live in misery because you can't ever enjoy your life it's not like that at all that's what I think a lot of people think when they hear about gut health you gotta like clean up the gut we gotta heal the guy is that you're going to eliminate everything and now your life's just going to be Bland you can't have any of the things in our last interview and I I was like what about wine I was like immediately and I think I had talked to about how there were other factors like coffee why alcohol there were things um and like not optimizing my sleep and when I was listening back to our interview I was just cracking up because I'm like my life has changed so much since that conversation and the little things like getting adequate sleep getting healthy sleep can really transform I think that that helped a lot with some of the flushing that I was dealing with as well it was so deeply rooted in a psychological space of like this program that was playing over and over again but there were things that absolutely contribute to it as well which is like poor diet lots of caffeine way too much caffeine the way you should be taking in um alcohol lack of sleep things that just help trigger those flushes that are not helping and and we're all we've all gone through that I mean I think every busy mom has this year or least of their life where they're just they're just functioning they're just getting through the days like you know you you can't go to sleep with that wine and you can't wake up without coffee and God help you if you have to get rid of the like but and I hear that all the time and then the idea of removing it is terrifying because you know that you're going to be miserable for a week without your coffee so it's hard to kind of commit to that but then if you realize like it is very temporary it's very temporary and so much can heal in a month and even my sister for example um had insomnia for years and years and years and I I finally got her to to do my cleanse month and she was resisting it and resisting it and what does this have to do with insomnia but she was at like a complete breaking point and she did it and what do you know like she sleeps like a baby so you know you can heal heal years and years and years worth of trauma and abuse um in a month you really can and you just you know and then you learn so much and then you just make better choices that's something that I've learned on my own journey is that you know it's taken about six years but once I started to get it it was like drastic changes were happening overnight it was it was so wild how I remember getting on blushing Phoenix at one point and just being like I don't know that there's ever going to be a cure for this and I'm not even going to focus on a cure anymore because I was so tired of the up and down of like oh I made progress oh no we're back where we started oh I made progress we're back where we started so I started thinking about how am I going to live anyway like how am I going to continue on with my life and I didn't realize that just by taking my focus off of it was healing me from from you know from what I was dealing with and when I think about the similarities with rosacea and the things that I was going through are people um from blushing Fitness are going through they are so similar and that if people aren't addressing some of the underlying issues whether that's the psychological emotional elements or um your your body I love that from um from the work that you do it's a holistic approach of looking at the person as a full individual and addressing all the different areas with healing one of the big things I've been talking about recently is is just reminding people that healing takes time that not to feel so distraught if you just don't feel like you're making progress and I think that's because this journey can be very isolating and people think that well you know you healed four months that that's miraculous I'm not healing in four months your program is six weeks what would you say to people about when they can expect to see I know that it's not everybody's going to be different but from your clients that have come through the program what's typical to see for for healing the first thing I say to them is at the end of the six weeks you are not going to be healed you you may have healed a little bit you you may be starting the process of healing but I mean if if you were this like Boulder that had come to a grinding Halt and we have to actually get the mo the boulder moving again it's it's gonna take six weeks you know 10 weeks three months before we start to start moving the other direction if you've been going in the wrong direction for so long so I I typically see a lot of progress in three to four months that's a really good place for a lot of people is consistency for three to four months and seeing major changes um we've had a lot of people in the first month it's not realistic but who can elim who can find a food sensitivity that they didn't know they had and it's very clear and so in that case for them there's significant healing right away um and then we have people who have been in touch with me for a year a year and a half and have done a lot of a lot of inner work um a lot of people like removing breast implants like doing things that you can't do right away um getting a divorce moving changing their life entirely focusing on the things that I've talked about and coming back a year later and saying look at my look at me like I feel so if you can go in without a timeline that is your best bet and like you said you really want to focus on not I want the outcome to be a better appearance you want the outcome to be a healed person like like an inner inner healing and and then the reflection of that is going to be your rosacea or your blushing going away but you've got to be healed inside first I love that um I wanted to ask you a question from your chiropractic side of things because I recently here in South Carolina started going to well I fell off of our stairs I missed a bottom step that fell and um at this age which in my mind I'm still 19. but at this age when you take a fall it is like I was just so impressed with myself that I didn't die or like break real it felt like I I've never broken ribs but it felt like what I would imagine broken ribs yeah and um and I fell on like my side like this so I kind of caught myself and went to the chiropractor um they did X-rays and they're fantastic but he's like have you ever seen your body before and I'm like not in a long time he's like your body you're literally going like this and it's in the fall it's from like years of like your spine so anyway he's he's like we won't get you back to 100 but we will get you really really good and you won't have like pain or anything like that and luckily I didn't have I didn't have any that he could see major issues from the fall he was shocked he's like the fall like that is is like being in a car accident so you're really lucky that you you know you took that fall the way you did yeah the only thing we saw was like my jaw was off just a little bit so okay but um I was I actually was flushing this was just about a month ago I was flushing while I was in there because it was an environment that I had never been in before it was really busy it was small um I get a little triggered anyway when I know somebody's going to touch me and like that's just like that's just that vulnerable state of being touched and uh but I I was waiting for the chiropractor oh and their air was out and it was like 90 days or something so it was like not the best first impression anyway it was fantastic and I was flushing when he came in and I was like just showing it to him and telling him about it so he didn't he wasn't alarmed right right you know he just looked at me like he couldn't care less um and no big deal not a big deal at all anyway I was talking to them afterwards and there's there's two they're Partners there and I said have you seen this before and he's like no I I mean sometimes when we do neck adjustments we might see something like that is that something that you've seen when when you are you still in Chiropractic practice yes yes is that something that you see with people flushing blushing when they are getting adjusted yeah I actually see it a lot especially if it's your first neck adjustment and your neck has never been adjusted before we see it a lot um it's kind of for for a lot of people sometimes they'll have an immediate release of sinuses like their their nose will start running right away we see that um a lot of people cry like they have an immediate emotional response um when you work on that level there's there's so much intertwined there there's a lot of um there's a lot of vascular issues going on in neurological things and connections and the base of your skull on the top of your your neck um when you manipulate that area it's it's a major release and so even like with babies with colic or um with children they respond so quickly and their their immediate reaction I love because it's it's you never know what to expect like some people scream some people cry some people and then you know with children it's like they'll come back a week later and be like oh you know they're sleeping now or oh you know what do you know they're no longer having this reaction and so it's pretty powerful yeah I love seeing that it's been a while since I I worked with a functional neurologist in Tennessee and um I I think that just being with him for so long and we hadn't really looked at my body and in quite some time and then I fell and I came to these new chiropractors which I was really nervous about because she's like such a big deal you know they're like manipulating your spine yeah I I um they have attraction that I'd never been on attraction bed before and I I Cry I Cry on attraction bed I Cry I with acupuncture I cry after adjustments sometimes just because I just feel that that means it hurts at all it's not because it's a release right so yeah um I was asking one of them and I was I'm curious to hear especially since we're recording this when I think about where I have been in a very um kind of disconnected space between head and body and real I heard somebody talking recently about like Vegas nerve I haven't done a lot of research on Vegas nerve but she was talking about how we kind of just cut it off here we cut everything off here so that we can look a certain way be a certain way smile be friendly and we shove everything back down into the body and so recently I was thinking about well that's really interesting for if we're cutting our emotions off and we're shoving the voice down and we're getting all that stuff down back in the body but the body would start to turn red because it's trying to say something that's just my theory what are your thoughts on that I I've never heard that I I think that's fascinating um there is so many connections that we know nothing about right I mean even now in this time learning about the connection between gut and skin and brain and this access the gut skin brain access and how it all it's fascinating because nobody has really done this research before and so I totally believe you you're on to something there that you know our emotions are one thing and we're constantly having to have this outward appearance of everything's fine and everything's fine and meanwhile inside you're like freaking out or having anxiety and you have to appear like everything is totally normal and we're conditioned to be like that and so where does it go where does the emotion go if you can't express the emotion so you're going to bury it and in Chinese medicine you vary emotions in organs and so the liver is anger and like every there's like a chart and I I always thought it was fascinating because I'd always look up rosacea and liver and it would always say anger and I would always say I'm not angry it's not anger I don't know what it is and then when I really started to think okay what if it is what if there's a connection that's when you really start to heal and you really start to address those things so yeah you're right on on that oh I love hearing about this I'm so fascinated by it when we moved here to South Carolina the first thing there were two things I wanted to do first one was I wanted to get my nose pierced because my daughter's about to turn 16 and she wanted to get her nose pierced and I was like you know what I had my nose pierced at 18 and because I wanted to go into Corporate America I went to this job over and over and over again to try to get a job and on like the fourth attempt the office manager told me if you take your nose ring out we will hire you so I took my nose ring out and it was like the first act because that was back in the day you know it was yeah so it was the first Act of trading out something that I really loved as an expressive thing right for a job and so and then the other thing I wanted to do was I wanted to get I have like random tattoo use that are just like at random on my body that you're kind of are telling a story and one of the things that I wanted to get on me was this is the um it's three chakras uh it is the throat and it's the um third eye for intuition and it was kind of some of the some of the lessons or things that I took from Tennessee with me that I was entering into South Carolina with knowing that I'm safe and that I belong knowing that I have a voice and I can trust that that voice and I can speak when it's time to speak even if it's scary and that I can really trust my intuition because that was something that I feel like I shut down for many years because people didn't understand it and I was looking for validation in the outside world of like so I find it interesting I love chiropractic care I love functional neurology I love all of those things but when you were talking about like even with the neck adjustment it's such a release and that's just something I've really been focusing on over the past few months of just the throat area um and any sort of release in the body I've been looking more into somatics and and things that are you know letting letting your body weep in the sense of feeling where is the pain um and I think it's so interesting just finding that that combination between when we're looking at flushing and redness and we're going straight for the surface like it's right here it's right here and we're like I've got this redness relief this is like a product review I was doing where I was like basically um I haven't even done I was gonna do a tick tock on it where I'm like it doesn't work it doesn't work yeah you're missing the boat it's everything there are some blemishes or like but it's not it's not going to do what you want it to do like there is no product out there that's gonna that I know of right now that's gonna do it no you've got to get to the core um so what are you working on now what do you plan to do in the future what are you studying listening to like what's going on in Dr Tara's world um so I'm I'm adding I mentioned parasites I'm adding a parasite um module to my course because when I was in France in the spring my daughter was doing a semester there and so I went to visit her for a long weekend and I came back so sick couldn't figure out what was wrong took several weeks and about 10 doctors visits to find out number one I had Celiac which of course thank goodness for this and number two I had a parasite and I was like oh my gosh like how does this happen and so it was fascinating to me and you know antibiotics parasites gone then I did a whole course of my own of um you know gut healing and my own herbs for parasite um but I found it fascinating and it turns out that like number one no one is testing this I mean I had to beg over and over and over for them to do a parasite test on me and um nobody wanted to do it it was like oh you don't have a parasite they they swore to me I didn't have a parasite and then when the test came back positive she said oh you're all you know in 10 years of practice you're only the second person I've ever found in the parasite I'm thinking that's because you don't test anyone but um parasites are a huge underlying cause of health issues and specifically rosacea so not that your doctor is going to test you especially you don't have symptoms but um we're now thinking that about 50 of the population is walking around with active parasites and doesn't know it so there's a lot of things you can do holistically um you don't need an antibiotic a lot of these things you you can do a specific protocol for parasite so I'm I'm going to be writing that and putting that in my course because I want people to be aware of the symptoms that they would be having and then how to address that themselves um and I'm just trying you know just trying to get the word out there as always because um you know Googling like I don't know if people can search for you and and find you but if you do a search for rosacea and natural healing you can't find me you find medication websites so um anything we can do to get the word out to get people the help they need when they're looking for holistic um ways of addressing this without just putting a medication on it fantastic yeah I think the only way people find me is if they know the term urethrophobia that is like kind of my key the key word where people find me when they usually message they'll say I just figured out there was a term for this and that's how they find blushing feelings pretty often or by hearing um when they're Googling certain things and they they hear a message usually with an interview that they'll they'll reach out and say I thought I had this but then now I'm thinking it's more about this and that's what I love about being in in community with you and um Dr Julie and Dr Madeline and others that that are in this space because we're kind of hitting it from all angles right right I'm hoping it and I see tons of rosacea people who share with me you know every time I'm I'm in an anxious situation I'm blushing and I'm like go see blushing Phoenix because you actually have erythrophobia and they've never heard of it no you know it's a very it's not a word that you you see often and most people in the medical community have never even heard of it so I'm so glad that you're bringing this to light and I know you have two books right two books and you're all over YouTube and you're growing and you're only getting bigger and bigger because there's a need for this there's a need for people like Dr Julie to address this um internally and you to share with people like you don't have to live with this there are actually things you can do and that was my biggest thing was I just wanted people to know that this is not a life sentence there's so much you can do you just don't know what to do so we're gonna we're gonna tell you what to do yeah it's something about people Paving away it's it just makes you feel so hopeful I know when I years ago was struggling so deeply with depression and I would go to a bookstore and I would just go to like the self-help area and find books of people who had overcome because I was like if they can do it I can do it and that's what I love about your story about you know trying to do all the things to get the help and realizing like this isn't good enough this is not good enough there's a better answer there's got to be a better answer and you went and found it for yourself and I'm so grateful for that and I know this is going to be so helpful for people who listen into this I will um put all of your information in our description box like we always do and I'll also link our previous interview from a couple of years ago um again so funny listening to it for for me in the parts that I'm sharing about myself self because you and I had just that's when we met so I know that was the first time we met I know and look how far we both died I know it's been two years I've moved states where like you know growing and expanding it's always such a pleasure to talk to you thank you so much for being willing to just do what you're doing in the community and spend this time with me so that we can get the word out to others who are looking for answers you're so welcome and I love chatting with you and and I love sharing what you're doing as well because you're doing amazing work so don't give up I won't give up we'll keep going and we'll spread the word hey friend technically this is the end of the video but Dr Tara and I had a little bit of a conversation prior to me diving into the interview questions and I didn't want to discard it because I think we're sharing some insightful stuff here so I wanted to attach that to the interview as well but I didn't want to put it at the beginning so if you're interested in checking that out then keep watching and you'll see that part of the interview hello Hi how are you I'm good how are you your hair got so long it's crazy because I was listening to our last um interview and I'm like two years ago it wasn't two years yeah that was before you had your last baby yes yes two years ago he's two now and I uh yeah my hair was so short you know I'm really only on Instagram and you're you're not on Instagram a lot but I know you're we have like a great YouTube account going but I don't check in a whole lot so I was checking on yours too and I was like wait a minute are you no longer you're no longer flushing is that right no it's so rare that it happens at all it um we moved out of state we left Tennessee and moved to South Carolina and I have been working you know I think the last time you and I talked I was like my goal is to like leave Corporate America and I just don't want to be in these like toxic environments well I was working for a software development company over the past two years and they are just fantastic and um the most healing environment I oversee our talent culture side of things so they're like you do for everybody what what you feel that this company did for you you know people come in they're really abused from the environments around them and we want to let people be safe and and decompress and then build back up and get into a place of creativity and authenticity and like who knew at a software development company that we could do that so it's been awesome and then just like work on yourself right of like not getting yourself emotionally worked up do you feel like that's part of it as well yeah I think that so much of my situation came from the authoritative environments of feeling just not good enough and once we moved to South Carolina it was like this huge like Consciousness shift and like Awakening that I feel like I had like this deep layer of leaving my homeland and being able to operate as who I am now and not feel like held back by these invisible strings and threads of like elementary school and middle school I know exactly what you mean yeah when you have that shift it's like life-changing yeah it is and I wound up I was going to this like so I work remote but uh my company is actually located here in South Carolina so and and I can go be with our leadership team at any time we've got out to lunch and dinner and had had some in-person moments together but they all know about blushing Phoenix they know that I was on a journey of healing I had a very direct conversation with my CEO about how I would try to avoid him because even though I know he is a nice kind person CEOs are not nice kind people and they are very damaging and so I was like I want I was like I realized that that's not a you problem that's a me problem but I want you to help me right me interacting with you and me going through all of this like trauma triggers inside of my body so that my body can learn that this is safe and he's like let's do it and oh yeah so I'm so happy for you and honestly like we can hopefully talk about this on the um like when I oh you're recording now but yeah um but I also feel like you're you said like it's so rare and and when I first healed rosacea um everyone was like it's not possible it never happens like you're the first person this has ever happened to and now there's like thousands and thousands of people so it's not like it's just that people don't know and I I mean it maybe it may be similar for you like once people are aware and then they take these active steps like who knows like maybe they're not looking at a lifetime of hiding out and medications and surgeries and all the things that you were even exploring right yeah and I and I get to the place too where I was like it's not even about not turning red anymore it's just about continuing to live my life and somewhere on that journey I noticed that the flushing had stopped and it will still happen from time to from time to time depending on like environmental things but it's not this um it's not from this deep psychological wound of lacking of self-worth and that feels so Elementary to me to think that I didn't have self-worth because or that I was super self-conscious because in my mind lacking self-worth and being self-conscious looks a certain way and I am not that look I'm very like out there in your face yes to know that that's truly what the root was is that it's a deep-rooted fear of not receiving the approval from the environment around me because if I am not approved or I say something that's out of place a lot of it was like healing um and realizing how often I had repressed my voice which I found very interesting because that's where my flushing would happen is up my neck and chest um and that and really digging into why am I doing that and that was and I'm very vocal so I'm like well I'm not repressing anything but I but I am I don't want to cause a disturbance I don't want to create friction with people and that came back from just like a deep childhood wound of a belief when I was a kid that if I am disruptive if I create an issue with the people around me then I will be discarded from the group and if I'm discarded from the group I'll die yeah and that's like that's ridiculous so when you spend time with it you're like that's not true it's so fascinating I I read this quote a few years ago and it was about like healing is actually like letting go of all the beliefs that are not yours and I was like oh my gosh like could that be true like could that could I have like here you know your pure soul is like your little two-year-old self when you're full of life and you don't have any of those fears and then as we age and we want to please people we adopt all these beliefs not not intentionally but just thinking that you're supposed to believe what your parents believe and you're supposed to you know fit in and not not make waves and and by the time you're 30 you're just this mass of other people's beliefs right and then undoing it all like that's what I spent the last you know three or four years was like realizing what was truly me and what was beliefs that I felt like I should have and then it's like when you can undo all that and get to who you are that's that's when the magic happens yeah and it's like a dissecting because there's I even see this with my two-year-old how we are conditioning him with good job or oh we gotta go potty you know like helping to condition him for natural human growth and you don't realize that you know as a kid you are performing it's constantly good job good job good job yeah and even when parents don't mean anything by that they they really are just validating you in your growth right but then we realize well this gets this reaction from Mom and this gets this reaction from Mom when I did when I do this thing and so it's kind of that good bad factor and just how we process that in our bodies as well so I think that for um flushers and blushers specifically I think that there's we always kind of look at and this is the same with rosacea as well I think it look we look at it like uh let's address the redness let's get to the redness I want to hide the redness I want to get rid of yeah what can I put on my skin to hide it and so that I can cover it and hide it and pretend it's not there yeah and all all the while it's still there getting progressively worse exactly yeah [Music]",

        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] howdy friends Giulini and today I want to talk to you about something that I struggle with quite a bit and that is feet and sleep is something that has a huge impact on rosacea and it's something that I often feel is quite a bit of my control but since a lack of sleep can lead me to have a lot more flare ups and be a lot more sensitive to my triggers I thought I would just share with you in case any of you struggle with sleep as well or you haven't made sleep kind of a high priority in helping to treat your Jose scia I thought I would just talk about it a little bit and go over some of the things that I've been doing to try to go to sleep more restfully or as much as I can and keep my symptoms under control because when I can sleep and when I can sleep regularly especially that's when my skin has feet it is has the smallest amount of redness the smallest number of symptoms it's the most comfortable it's at least reactive so I highly recommend getting a good night of sleep if you want to keep your rosacea symptoms under control there are a lot of things that as I said I suffer from insomnia all the time so I am far from being an expert on sleep but I am somebody who knows what it is to struggle with sleep and therefore what it is that I can do to help to get as much sleep as possible so if you can sleep really really easily that's awesome then it's really working in your favor if you don't sleep easily like I don't sleep easily then um maybe some of these tips will help you a little bit hopefully they do help me I know that I can't really say that I sleep great but what I do I think it's because I put a serious effort in the first thing that almost anybody will recommend to you if you want to sleep better is to try and keep to a regular schedule I do I try and go to bed at the same time and get up at the same time every single morning weekends weekdays it doesn't matter i set my alarm and i try to stick to that schedule because it really does help you to feel more sleepy at the time where you should be becoming restful so that you will fall asleep and it helps you to wake up a little bit more in the morning regardless of how much sleep you've had just because your body is used to that particular rhythm I also believe in the idea of a sleep routine I don't mean that you know you have to spend exactly two minutes brushing your teeth and then you have to do I don't hands like a rigid routine like that but that there are certain things that you should repeat every day before going to bed just to kind of build it into your mind that we're preparing for sleep after this you know you can expect to lie down the bed and fall asleep so it's sort of almost just raining your brain to expect certain things so that you've taught yourself this is a winding down process and that sleep will be coming next and it doesn't have to be anything complicated or anything like that you know maybe an hour before bedtime you turn off all screens so that you don't have that blue light exposure you might do something quiet like read or meditate or just something like that you might take a bath or shower brush your teeth do your cleansing and moisturizing at everything routine get into your pajamas that whole thing so I feel that a bedtime routine should be about an hour long I don't mean that you're specifically getting ready for bed for an hour but um just that you to start to do your winding down things and you start to become calm even dimming the lights can have an impact because it can help to stimulate melatonin production in your brain and melatonin is really important for helping you to fall asleep it's a part of that circadian rhythm I do drink coffee in the morning I try to get off caffeine all together but I just really enjoy Chaffin ated coffee and there I haven't found a decaf that I really really enjoy so I drink caffeine but I stop doing that at around one o'clock in the afternoon I try to give myself a good solid half day without any caffeine who like or any other kind of stimulant I don't drink energy drinks at all I try to get all that out of my system by the time it's bedtime because my room is thrown off a lot of the time regardless of how much I stick to a schedule and things like that I also do a whole pile of other things to create kind of almost an environment to appropriate for sleep so I do things like turn down the heat in my home in the wintertime and I turn up the air-conditioning a little bit in the heat of the summer because I find that a warm bed but a cool home is a much more comfortable way to sleep I find if I'm overheated I'm much less likely to sleep than I am if I'm slightly on the cool side being overheated will wake me up at night but I won't wake up cold so I find you know turning down the heat wearing pajamas or whatever that are appropriate to the right body temperature i usually go on the light side and then pile on the blankets because I can move blankets but I don't have to actually change my outfit in bed sleep and on the subject of being sort of cool before like at bedtime also I tend to shower at the end of the night because I use things like lavender shampoo and lavender problem natural lavender products not lavender scented but things that actually have lavender extract in them and those lavender is a very very calming sent so I try to use that kind of product which means the showering at night really works for me and while I do enjoy a warm shower or a warm bath and that's warm not hot because otherwise a hot shower will flare up my cheeks but um although I do enjoy that I do for the last 30 seconds crank the temperature down to cool I know you're supposed to make it ice cold for that last 30 seconds if you really want to simulate your immune system I personally can't stand that in the wintertime it's just too cold so I just turn it down to quite cool slightly less than lukewarm so that it feels chilly and then you know I just finish up rinsing off everything and then get out and dry off really quickly because if I'm actually cold like that when I get into bed I warm up and then go to sleep so that may sound weird but it is actually really effective I found that like taking a shower at night not only helps with the kind of aromatherapy side of things but it also helps with the regulation of body temperature in a really effective way so that I just kind of helps you relax myself and prepare myself for sleeping and that also feeds into the whole routine bedtime routine because I've made basically showering and then brushing my teeth and doing my moisturizing and all that kind of stuff a part of the whole routine and then I just go to bed so it all works in very very nicely into the same sort of telling my brain it's time to one down that like fun to sleep if I'm having a day where I find that I'm I know that I should be starting to feel tired and I'm not there are a few T's that I find work really really nicely not only with winding down and feeling common becoming restful but also that work really nicely with my skin as well and the two teams that I like our chamomile and hibiscus tea I like a Disqus more than chamomile I can for whatever reason I have a really often on relationship from camomile and there are times when I find that that really suits me and I feel like sleeping and there are times when I find that that makes me sleep that I wake up feeling kind of groggy and a little bit messed up so when I don't really feel like testing the water it would have chamomile a little bit I like to go with hibiscus tea I just find that really calming and soothing I really enjoy the flavor so if you haven't tried that before it might be worth testing out just to see how you like it because I just I find it to be a very soothing one to drink in the evening I know there are 11 dirties as well but I really don't enjoy the taste of lavender I like the smell I find it very calming but the taste of it is very it's off-putting to me I really don't like it in the wintertime another thing that i found was really good overnight is running a humidifier in my bedroom i just have a little one and it's a cool mist humidifier I don't use the warm ones those are the ones that are meant for a really short term if you have a cold and things like that using a warm water humidifier is basically a faster route to getting mold in your home so I use a cool mist one just to bring the humidity up because it's crazy drying my place during the wintertime and I found that that makes a huge difference in my ability to sleep comfortably in my ability to breathe comfortably while I'm sleeping and my skin isn't nearly as dry when I wake up in the morning so I find that makes a huge difference I really love my humidifiers you haven't tried that out and it is driver you lift you might want to try and pop on those on because it makes a really big difference it's a surprising difference actually in terms of supplements and you know sleep medication please stuff like that I've never tried a prescription sleep drug I don't want to go that route at all I do have insomnia and they have been offered to me but I just I really not interested in that I would have to be very very desperate for sleep to actually get to that point I was sent this this product here it was just sent to me in my um PL box and it's extra strength tylenol night time it took me forever to actually try this out because i read the kind of directions and everything about it really really carefully and it says specifically that it is meant for youth if you have pain and if you can't sleep you have to have both of those things it says not to use it if you have pain but you're sleeping fine or if your sleepless but you're not suffering from pain so I have no idea why this was sent to me but then I could finally try it because I hurt my shoulder not too long ago and it was really aching while I was trying to sleep and so I thought okay you know I give him i'm going to try that and so i did test this out and i slam I didn't want to and I even was kind of nervous about it you're supposed to take two of them and I only took half of that and I slept like a baby both nights not used it and I was not braggy in the morning I was expecting to be groggy the ingredients in it our feet of medicine and I spend hydra mean hydrochloride acetaminophen is a painkiller it's like what tylenol is just when you buy regular tylenol and the siphon hydra mean the hydrochloride is i believe on any histamine it's one of the more common any histamines that you can just get in the drugstore but it also happens to have the side effect of being somewhat having some sedative properties so those things combined are actually really common place this didn't seem like a very super unique product but I was really really glad to have it for the two pills which was supposed to be one dose but I stretched out 22 when I hurt my shoulder that said I probably wouldn't buy it again because I don't like relying on that kind of thing I feel very nervous that I could form a dependency on it and I sleep I have enough sleep circles that I don't need to become dependent on something to help me to sleep if I do find that I haven't been able to sleep well at all for several nights so maybe I go two or three nights with one or two hours of sleep per night I do have a tically drugstore brand supplements that I use I don't have it here but I mean it's it's just a drugstore brand one I think you can get it in Jameson as well and a couple of other things it's some really common ingredients that you find in virtually every sleep supplement valerian root passionflower hops may have chamomile in it in fact I think it it does it does not have melatonin in it I'm not ready to try that yet I've read a lot of studies on melatonin and you can mess that up really easily even through supplementation and there are a lot of different kinds of problems that can form by using melatonin supplements wrong so I'm not going to go that route unless I desperately have to and I want guidance from my doctor if I'm going to go in that direction but in terms of just using the supplement that has the herbal supplements that I have that I just finished listing off the ingredients for it that's it doesn't have a sedative in it but it I do find that it relaxes my body a little bit it relaxes my mind my main problem stopping me from sleep is an overactive mind so it just helps to take the kind of edge off if you want to say that and it helps me to sleep a little bit better and then I can get back into my own routine and rhythm I'll use that for maybe up to two nights in a row I try not to use that very much at all because I do find that it's better to try and find your own rhythm for sleep through your own methods of the right routine staying away from stimulants and all those other things that I said earlier so I will you supplement if I absolutely have to but most of the time I'm just trying to kind of get it under control myself and how my own anxieties become restful try and become peaceful at night and then to myself asleep so yeah and when I do get sleep my skin is way way way better than it is when I have been restless and when I have been sleepless so because i do have insomnia a lot i can definitely tell the difference in my skin so i can tell you that your sleep will make a very big difference in the state of your rosacea symptoms so if you haven't been able to figure out exactly why your skin is as reactive as it is and you also struggle with sleep you might want to consider doing something focusing on replacing your sleep because that could be actually what's standing in your way that could be the main barrier that has been stopping you from being able to get everything back under control again in terms of your symptoms you could be doing absolutely everything right but if you're not sleeping your skin will still be reactive because when you don't get sleep there's more inflammation in your body you're more likely to be stressed out because the cortisol that levels that are higher in your body that's the stress hormone you don't eat as well when you don't sleep because you crave things that are sweet or fatty or filthy and it just slowly kind of it just eats away at the overall health of your body so by replacing that sleep and bringing down the inflammation and getting your stress and you're eating under control then you can see that in your face you can actually improve your skin quality and your skin health and get your rosacea symptoms down yet so if you have been struggling with sleep or if you haven't made sleep a priority maybe that should become a part of your kind of rosacea busting routines and your rosacea of a single lifestyle and it'll make a difference for you yeah so I hope that this kind of long babble on about dumb sleep and rosacea and the things that I do to try and improve my sleep was helpful to you and interesting to you and if you did like this video I hope you'll give it a thumbs up and if you want to see more videos like this one or where I try out products or where I try to cover it with my rosacea with makeup and i hope to subscribe to my channel because I make new videos every Sunday and Thursday and others net I will see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "hi everyone this lesson is on what to avoid if you have rosaceous we're going to talk about certain emotional factors environmental factors and certain dietary factors that can actually worsen signs and symptoms of rosacea in this lesson before we talk about those exacerbating factors let's talk about what rosacea is so rosacea is a chronic inflammatory in autoimmune condition involving recurrent episodes of skin lesions on the face and the signs and symptoms of rosacea includes telling giac Pages erythema reddening of the face papules and pustules as well and the pathophysiology of rosacea is not entirely understood but there does seem to be a genetic or family history component of this that is an important risk factor the topic of this lesson is that there are certain factors and some of these includes foods and Beverages and some environmental factors that can exacerbate symptoms of rosacea we're going to talk about those as we go through this lesson before we talk about those exasperating factors I want to briefly talk about the pathophysiology of this condition because it's going to better help us understand those exacerbating or triggering factors so the pathophysiology of rosacea is going to be due to this regulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning and issues with vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels vasodilation is dilation of blood vessels so with regards to the dysregulation of innate in adaptive immune functioning this is due to increased expression of a particular cell receptor in that cell respect is known as toll-like receptor 2 so there's increased expression and activation of this receptor that leads to dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning with regards to the vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels they seems to be due to an increased release of vasoactopeptides also due to increased expression inactivation of trpv receptors including trpv1 two and four so trpv stands for transient receptor potential vanilloid so it's transient receptor potential vanilloid or trpv one two and four but some other trpvs can also be implicated as well but these are the ones we're going to talk about in this lesson and then another important receptor that can lead to issues with the pathophysiology in this condition includes a receptor called transient receptor potential anchorin one or trpa1 receptor so there's increased expression and activation of this receptor as well and along with this there is activation of what we call an inflammasome so an inflammasome has the same implies is involved in inflammatory processes so the triggers I'm going to talk about as we go through this lesson are actually going to activate some of these receptors and this is the reason why I want to talk with the pathophysiology here let's talk about the things that should be avoided the triggers of rosacea one of them is going to be stress and this is going to be emotional stress and emotional stress can actually exacerbate symptoms of rosacea via activation of trpv1 receptor so it's going to be important to reduce your stress another thing that can trigger rosacea symptoms is sunlight or UV exposure or ultraviolet light exposure so sunlight exposure or ultraviolet light exposure worsen symptoms through activation of tlr2 and trpv4 receptors so in order to reduce ultraviolet light induced activation of these receptors it would be good to wear sunscreen or try to avoid sunlight as much as possible if you have rosacea some other triggers includes alcohol so alcohol can trigger symptoms of rosacea via activation of tlr2 and trpv-1 Pathways and in some alcohol beverages is even worse because there are higher levels of histamine in certain alcoholic beverages like wine and this histamine can actually cause vasodilation so wine or more specifically red wine can lead to not only activation of tlr2 and trpv1 Pathways but also increase the vasodilation because it has higher levels of histamine it's a histamine-rich beverage so it would be best to avoid alcohol and especially red wine now hot liquids can also trigger rosacea as well and it's actually going to be the heat from the hot liquids that can actually trigger rosacea so excessive heat from hot liquids and from weather and we'll talk about this later on can actually activate trpv one and two receptors so be best to wait for hot beverages like hot tea or coffee to cool down before drinking it another important trigger of rosacea is eating spicy food and specifically Chili Peppers or other spices that contain capsaicin so capsaicin is the chemical that actually causes us to feel that burning sensation when we eat spicy food so it actually activates heat receptors and the heat receptor in the mouth is actually trpv1 so trpv1 in the mouth activation of this receptor actually leads to us having the sensation of a burning sensation and this is the same receptor that is activated by those hot liquids we just talked about in activation of trpv1 receptors in the mouth again causes that burning sensation but then itself because it's activating trpv1 and there's increased expression of that receptor in rosacea this can actually trigger rosacea symptoms in those patients so it'd be best to avoid or reduce your consumption of spicy food now cheese can also be another important dietary factor that can worsen rosacea cheese is itself a histamine-rich food and along with this also processed meats or histamine rich as well and as I mentioned before with regards to red wine histamine can cause vasodilation worsening the redness and flushing symptoms so it'd be best to avoid cheese and processed Meats chocolate is also another important trigger of rosacea chocolate contains something called cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde actually activates trpa1 or transient receptor potential anchoring one two exasperate symptoms of rosacea and chocolate itself also triggers the release of histamine so it's something that can actually both activate trpa1 but also lead to the release of histamine from other cells so it'd be best to actually try to avoid eating or at least reduce your consumption of chocolate tomatoes can also trigger rosace in some patients as well and again it's because tomatoes also contain cinnamaldehyde and again as we just learned cinnamaldehyde activates trpa1 and tomatoes like chocolate can actually trigger the release of histamine as well so again try to avoid eating tomatoes if that happens to be a trigger for you significant temperature changes can also be another potential trigger as well so significant heat or cold we talked about the heat from hot liquids being a potential trigger and cold exposure can also be a potential trigger as well heat exposure specifically again activates trpv1 and two and cold weather activates trpa1 so again it'd be best to try to either put on good clothing when you're out in very cold weather and try to avoid too much heat exposure both of these can help to reduce the triggering of rosacea symptoms there can be some other weather effects as well that can lead to an exacerbation of rosacea symptoms and this includes wind exposure so wind blowing on the face can actually lead to activation of some of those receptors we talked about before and humidity humidity actually activates trpv4 and then exercise can also be another trigger for some some patients so especially heavy or rigorous exercise this can actually lead to activation of tlr2 and trpv1 Pathways and there are some medications and supplements that can trigger rosacea symptoms and these include beta blockers topical steroids and vitamin B3 or niacin supplementation niacin can cause flushing but in patients with rosacea can be even worse so these are some other potential triggers for rosacea flare-ups so the triggers we talked about in this lesson are not going to affect everybody some patients will have some triggers some patients will have other triggers but knowing the most common triggers can help you think about and be aware of what may be triggering your potential flare-ups of rosacea so triggers you find that are causing your rosacea symptoms you can avoid those if you want more information on rosacea please check out my full in-depth lesson on this topic as we talk about more of the pathysiology the signs symptoms and how it's diagnosed and treated in that lesson if you found this lesson novel please like And subscribe for more lessons like this one and as always thanks so much for watching and hope see you next time",

        "transcript": "There's nothing like an air of confidence. Looking good and feeling good inside. But what if you had a skin condition on your\nface? Would that impact your self-confidence? We're about to discuss the common chronic\ninflammatory skin condition called Rosacea with our guest, Board Certified Dermatologist,\nDr. Dimitry Palceski. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you for having me. Thanks for being here. Let's talk about Rosacea. What exactly is it doctor? Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder\nthat can give you redness to your face and can make you flush and give you pimples and\ngive you bumps. And it's interesting because 1 in 20 Americans\nhave it, which is about 16 million people. That's a lot. It is, but yet it's so under diagnosed, and\npeople that have Rosacea the problem with it is is that their perception of themselves\nand the people that look at them often give them a negative impact. And let's talk about that perception because\nhere the recent Face Values Global Perceptions Survey sponsored by Galderma Laboraties shows\nthat many ways in which Rosacea takes a deep emotional toll on sufferers. That's amazing. I mean, it really does impact them. Tremendously. More than we ever thought. And actually, what they did was, is they looked\nat 7,000 people across eight different countries. So, in all of these different countries, they\nfound that there was a common thread. People with redness were judged differently. They found that they were looked at to be\nless attractive. They were found to have less of an ability\nto have a date or to go out with somebody or to get a promotion at a job. And because of that it really affected the\nself-esteem of the person that had Rosacea, and also their social interactions with everybody\naround them. And we did a quick poll about that same thing\nwe're talking about, and I'd like our viewers to take a look. Shall we? Let's do that. What are your first impressions of these people\nin these pictures? Bad skin. I would say the lady needs a makeover. They look clean cut except for the face. Umm. Maybe sunburn? They don't look too happy? Need to change their skin. If it's an allergic reaction, get some kind\nof cream to clear it up. If I was the woman and I had to go out, then\nI'd put on makeup. Would you hire this person and do they look\nsuccessful to you? I wouldn't say I wouldn't hire them, but I'd\nsay they aren't terribly concerned with appearance, and it would depend on the office culture. I mean, there's no doubt that it can really\naffect someone's self-esteem. So, my question to you is if someone has Rosacea,\nDoctor, what can they do? I mean, it seems like we need more awareness\nand compassion for that matter. Oh, absolutely. Only 1 in 10 people, or 10%, of people that\nhave Rosacea even know that they have it or were diagnosed by a Dermatologist. Really? You have to go seek treatment or find, there\nhas to be support groups and more education so that people can treat their disease so\nthat it doesn't get worse. So why are they misdiagnosed? What's going on here? Why don't they know? Well, Rosacea is challenging because it can\nlook like other diseases of the skin. It could look like acne. And actually half of the people that have\nRosacea think they have acne. So when they start treating their perceived\nacne, and they make the Rosacea worse, they don't understand why. Oh my goodness. And then there's trigger factors. So there are certain things that make Rosacea\nflair, and it's all the good things. It's the spicy foods that you want to eat. It's the red wines. If you're emotionally upset, it makes you\nflair or flush. If you wear certain makeups. It all makes it worse. There's also some research that suggests that\nthere's a mite that lives on all of our skin called Demodex, and that mite has been shown\nto be found in greater quantities in people with Rosacea, which can potentially trigger\nit even more. So we know it's a chronic disease. Can you medicate it? Can you do something? Are there treatments? Oh my gosh. Absolutely. Once you find an accurate diagnosis, it can\nbe treated. Great. With what? Well. There are a few different options out there,\nand unlike over-the-counter medicines, these are actually FDA approved to calm down all\nof the symptoms of the redness. Soolantra Cream. Topical medicine you apply once daily, and\nwithin two weeks you'll start to see reduction within those bumps. There's an oral medicine called Oracea capsule. And Oracea is fantastic because it works from\nthe inside out. It's an anti-inflammatory that calms down\nthe surface changes. And then for persistent redness, Mirvaso Gel. You put it on and it can last up to 12 hours. And Doctor, what else should people know about\nthese medications. Like all medicines, side effects are possible. For Soolantra Cream, you can have some application\nsite irritations, some stinging, some burning. With Mirvaso Gel, they can be very similar\nas well. There can be some stinging, some redness,\nsome tinging. You can get a little bit of irritation. And for the oral medicine, you can sometimes\nsee a little bit of diarrhea. You can see some soreness to the throat or\nthe nose. Possibly some increase in liver enzymes, and\nevery now and then maybe a little high blood pressure. But again, I want to go back to the fact that\nif you suspect you have Rosacea or you don't know, it's really important to get that accurate\ndiagnosis from a Board Certified Dermatologist. Correct Doctor? Yes, correct. Because Rosacea gets worse over time. And if you can treat it early, you can control\nthe symptoms, you can watch the trigger factors and learn what they are, you can minimize\nall of the redness and the bumps and the pimples. Fabulous.

        "transcript": "hey guys i am so overjoyed to be back with you it has been a little bit of time but this is the entire reason i am making this video now i need to go inside you probably notice i was a little bit less active on social media but i really really needed to just go inside to figure out the last 10 of my rosacea journey but when i last spoke to you guys about my rosacea i was having i think i had one flare-up three months previous having these little itty-bitty flare-ups right well since that video i haven't had a flare-up which is very exciting and i googled how long can you say that you're cured of a disease like how long does it need to be and it was pretty skeptical but i'm gonna say that i'm cured of rosacea because i have had to flare up in a year which is pretty amazing what i want to talk about is that last 10 of how i figured out my rosacea but i'm going to go through the whole process of how i treated my rosacea in four steps because i know that it can be so incredibly overwhelming 23 and being told you've got an incurable disease that you're gonna live with for the rest of your life that came on overnight it is so overwhelming and given the current situation that the world is in and people are under so much stress everyone is having more skin issues more gut issues more mental health issues than ever before and i just think that we need to nurture each other and look after each other so i am so excited to share this with you in the hope that it brings you the same joy that has brought me in the hope that it brings you a little bit more information a little bit more insight i think these four steps will really tie everything together for you and i'm really excited to hear from you guys and i really truly hope it helps it worked for me four steps the first step is a massive one i really want to talk about our nervous system so how is your nervous system tied in with your rosacea how is our nervous system tied in with this heat that flares up through our face the thing is that i was constantly in this state of sympathetic nervous system complete overdrive like fight or flight all the time whether it was in relation to like my gut issues were causing me to be in that sympathetic nervous stimulation stress whatever it was the first thing we have to talk about is mindfulness and managing your stress load calming down your nervous system take anything from this entire video please just take never underestimate the effect stress can have on your skin your health and everything else why do we need to calm down our nervous system well the thing is most of us operate our lives in this complete sympathetic nervous system overdrive and what that basically means is that resting and digesting is turned off and our body is highly stimulated all the time what that does is drain your adrenals in western medicine in eastern medicine what it means is it compromises your kidneys and what that means is you don't have this grounding you're more reactive to things when things happen you instead of being proactive you probably find in your life you're reactive i know when i was the most sick that i was my mum was like i don't know you anymore you're so defensive you're so quick to defend yourself and it's because we are we're in this fight or flight like trying to protect ourselves when we're under a lot of stress our organs get under constraint when things get constrained they get tired they get fatigued and they hate the energy it kind of just it gets lost and it rises upwards and we get this heat this flushing through our face it's kind of like have you ever felt frustrated or you've bottled up an emotion and you can literally almost feel the steaming coming up rising upwards you know throughout the body heat rises well the story with that is we have to manage our nervous system if you want to manage your rosacea my routine right now is looking like waking up before everyone else so no one is interrupting me i also go to bed earlier than everyone else i go i write in my journal i get off my chest all those things that i know trigger my rosacea all those things that make me feel like i've got that heat in my body that i need to release so it's anger it's frustration it's resentment all of these emotions these low vibrational emotions that are heavy on us i get them down on paper if i'm feeling really frustrated i literally sometimes write like 20 minutes i'm just like oh you know it might be first of all problems but it's it's important to me so i'll do that usually it takes five minutes let's hope i'm not having a really bad day and then what i'll do is i'll do my breathing exercises so the first one i love to do is alternate nostril breathing so in eastern medicine the left side of our bodies are feminine and our right side is our masculine and i find that with heat it's very much like a masculine symptom you know it's very like overpowering and very bold and hot you know when you think of like hot or cold what would you think of as masculine or feminine i find this really beneficial for me is doing alternate nostril breathing so you basically block one nose breathe out the other keep going back and forth back and forth back and forth if i if i was having a day where my rosacea was really bad or i felt like i was really operating in my mouth and i just needed to chill the hell out i would actually breathe through my left nostril and out my right nostril and i wouldn't repeat the other side i would just keep going keep going transferring that energy over until i felt centered the second thing i like to do is another breathing exercise which stimulates our parasympathetic nervous system which basically is breathing for five seconds and try and breathe out for ten okay obviously a bit hard to do while i'm talking but you get what i mean so when your out breath is twice as long as your in-breath you are putting your body in that state of resting and digesting that's exactly what we want that is bringing the heat that's operating up here through the face down down down down down where it's meant to be down in our kidneys down in our organs for digesting our food all of that goodness so that's my number one thing never ever underestimate the result that having a nervous system that is completely in overdrive and how that's affecting your skin in particularly your rosacea okay so the second thing ties into the first but it's emotions and i did touch on this briefly when i did my previous video but honestly i have a story to share with you and it is literally craziness so i was doing energy work with a practitioner i always work with she's an angel and she's helped me so much i had this feeling right i just felt like i had this like compression in my chest and i said to her i don't know where it's coming from whatever anyway we ended up like digging into it digging into it digging into it digging into it and what we uncovered was i was fearing so many things i was fearing the state of the world i was fearing am i going to be able to go back to america i was feeling when am i going to be able to see my family again you know all these things that all of us right now are currently experiencing you know it's just it's just the fear of the unknown and i think that's why anxiety has also just gone through the roof anxiety is literally fear of the future no one knows what the future holds we've all got this fear inside us and when she tapped into that fear and i acknowledged it i acknowledged what all the fears were and i told myself i have full trust in my body because a big fear with me was am i going to get sick again told myself i trust my body all the fears around the universe everything that's going on i just said i have got trust in the universe's divine timing i have got trust that whatever's going on right now it has a solution there will be an end and everything will be better in the future and i just kept telling myself this kept telling myself this literally i felt the heat in my body dissipating it just reminded me of how much our emotions are physically stored in our body especially in the liver so the liver is the wood element anger resentment all those like heavy emotions are always associated with our liver and when you look at chinese medicine rosacea is usually directly linked to heat rising upwards from the liver so i found that truly fascinating and another little story i had as i went on a women's retreat did embodied movement i had never done this before i was a dancer so tell one to eight what steps we're doing like that's what i'm comfortable with we ended up doing a body movement where you all close your eyes you're in a circle with all these women and you put on different songs and you just move however your body wants to move like if you want to dance like a crazy person like you can do whatever you want and then she put on this song she was like i need you to shake and i shook my body and i shook my body and i shook my body and all of a sudden i started crying and i felt this heat rising up through my body and it was so overwhelming but i felt this massive shift and that's what embodied movement does it's shifting physical emotions that are stored in our body honestly if we can all come to terms with the fact that our emotions affect our physical body we will all be so much better for it because i can't tell you how much this last 15 of my health my overall happiness from just releasing these things from my body and the rosacea it doesn't exist anymore i can just tell anyone if you can control your nervous system and if you can go inside deeply inside uncover those emotions it is painful obviously it's challenging it's hard but if you can release those emotions you can release that stagnant energy because things that stagnate generate heat if you can release those stagnant energies i promise you not only will your rosacea be better your mental health will be better your overall health will be better you'll have more energy because the energy can flow properly that was something that i always believed in but truly until i had those experiences those extreme experiences and i realize i have to share this with people stored emotions can manifest all rounds of illness and this goes back thousands of years in chinese medicine each emotion is directly attached to each organ but truly i experienced it for myself so if you can do anything for yourself today for your skin today is to work on your mental health work on releasing emotions and trauma i'm here for you i get it next thing which you've already covered so i'm going to just like dust over this really quickly gut dysbiosis if you have sibo you're like 60 something percent i told you in the other video more likely to have rosacea so check take that off check you don't have sibo you can do a saliva test or you can do a breath test i did a breath test um but honestly a lot of times symptoms are proof enough the next thing as well we've got dysbiosis is leaky gut every single person on this planet unless you aren't touched by environmental chemicals pollutants toxins in our food stress has some level of leaky gut you're just on a spectrum have you got a little bit or have you got a lot because i know for sure that i had a lot and leaky gut is the last thing that i'm still mending it takes a really long time guts leaky molecules that aren't meant to transfer through into the bloodstream can get into the bloodstream which increases an inflammatory response hyperactive immune system immune response autoimmune disease all those things and it's been so studied i can't stress you enough how much this has been studied since i've been focusing on my leaky gut and it's everything together it is this four pronged approach but whenever i focus on my gut health my skin health gets better my mental health gets better is that gut brain access the body that's why i love holistic medicine and i'm so excited to be a practitioner soon because literally it's just absolutely fascinating how every single part of our body is directly linked and interconnected from our thoughts to our emotions to our physical body our spiritual body everything so to continue on with gut dysbiosis the last thing is food food is our friend food is not to be feared we covered fear and emotion that is not helping anyone food is our friend my only recommendation is yes try and eat foods that are lower in histamines of course that's a given but more than that try and eat foods instead of saying it has to be low fodmap it has to be low histamine it can get really overwhelming it gets to a point where i've had full meltdowns being like what do i eat just eat things that are nourishing by nature things that are cooked soups stews broths all those good things things that your mom used to make casserole things that have been cooked for a very long time that are easy to digest have lots of greens but have them cooked and have a lot of really good healthy fats things like mct oil so rich in caprylic acid if you've got any bad bacteria in your gut that is going to be so hugely beneficial so i can't stress enough how much good fats are so important i ate so much fat can't live unless i've got like 100 avocados in the house olive oil coconut oil all of these things you're so good so nourishing amazing for your hair health too amazing for your cognitive function just everything good fats cook your leafy greens and eat things that are really nourishing and easy to digest uncomplicate things i know it can get really overwhelming mindfulness mindfulness and nervous system we've had emotion trapped emotion and releasing trauma gut health hormones big one hormones are massive the last things in my journey have been healing this leaky gut once and for all and regulating my hormones because as you know i also came off contraception at the start of last year and that in itself has been a huge journey because i was on contraception from literally pretty much the day i got my period so it's been a huge process hormones play a massive role with rosacea so this is what i'm talking about about everything being connected if your gut health's not quite right your hormones aren't going to be quite right if you're quite stressed operating up here your cortisol is going to be stealing all your sex hormones it's going to be eating away your estrogen and new progesterone which creates a whole other wealth of problems and that's why it's his four-pronged approach i went from having really low estrogen all of a sudden having really really low progesterone i was experiencing lots of mood swings depressive tendencies but i knew i wasn't depressed sometimes i would just wake up and just feel like so not with it and not myself when i was doing the energy healing and we were connecting with each other and connecting with my guides she was saying you know that last part from emotion to do with the rosacea and the heat that's in your body is your hormones and it comes back down to the kidneys nourishing the kidneys trying to really heal that adrenal fatigue so i'd really recommend that anyone with rosacea problems gets a hormone check which i just think when people think skin issues especially in our society you know it's just like dermatology which is amazing i never want to take away anything from western medicine i think we're so lucky to have it but you know dermatology it's the view of the skin no one ever asks you what else is going on and that was my journey and that's why it took me so long to figure out how to heal because i had no one telling me that georgia this is a multifaceted approach that's it for me i would really appreciate guys i have created a website that i love and i have put so much nourishment and so much goodness into it i would be so grateful if you could head over there i also put everything in this video in writing in an article over there as well so you've got a reference that you can go back to instead of trying to find three minute 36 when she said this i'll be really grateful if you could have a look at it i'm going to link it just here i know what you think please please comment how you're going with your rosacea how any of my tips have helped you and please also comment any videos that you guys would really like to see because i'm here and i'm here to stay so i just want to tell you guys how much i appreciate you i understand the journey that you are on and i am here through it all with you 110 so i love i appreciate all of you thank you so much for engaging and taking the time to listen to what i have to say always remember that it's my journey and i'm currently not a health professional but i'm just here to share my story in the hopes that it benefits some of you",

        "published_at": "2014-06-06T23:11:43Z",
        "transcript": "Rosacea is a common skin condition that affects the face and most often affects fair skinned patients but can affect patients of any racial background. It's chronic and progressive which means that it's long lasting and will get worse over time unless treated. Some of the most common symptoms of rosacea are persistent background redness, dilated blood vessels, flushing, which is when the face becomes red with a sensation of heat or burning. Some patients even get pimples on the cheeks. Rosacea tends to start after 30, and affects women more often then men, but men have more severe symptoms. As I mentioned, Rosacea is a chronic and progressive condition so this means that it is very long lasting and it will get worse over time unless treated so we try and identify rosacea early when it's in its mildest forms because it's easier to treat, and it may have an impact on how the disease will progress over time. I think it's so important to keep in mind that while rosacea may not have a huge medical impact on patients, it can really affect their sense of self and overall emotional well being. Onreltea is a topical gel, recently approved by Health Canada, the first of its kind to treat persistent facial redness in patients 18 years of age or older. Onreltea may help patients that have persistent facial redness, background facial redness of the cheeks. When applied to the skin, it will actually constrict the blood vessels so the skin looks less red. When patients apply it, they'll see an improvement within typically about 30 minutes and they'll see the peak effect or maximum effect by about 3 hours so this will offer a new option for patients who suffer from persistent facial redness of rosacea. It's important to know that we have no cure for rosacea, and while Onreltea can help control the symptom of background redness, the effects do wear off sometime around 12 hours, and when patients want to see the improvement again, they'd need to reapply the treatment. It's also important to emphasize that no treatment is without side-effects. In the clinical trials, the most common side-effects were a worsening in redness, itching, and burning sensations which occurred in 1.2 to 3.3% of patients. The side-effects were usually mild to moderate. A pea-sized amount of the gel would be applied to each of the following areas: Forehead, chin, cheeks, and nose for a total of 5 pea-sized applications for the whole face. It's important to spread it very evenly, blend toward the edge, and wash your hands thoroughly after application. I'd advise patients with rosacea to work with their dermatologists, first of all,  to make sure that the diagnosis is right and to make sure that they actually have rosacea, and second, in addition to medical treatments like we've discussed today, to consider lifestyle measures. Ensure they're avoiding any triggers for their rosacea, practicing fairly strict sun avoidance and protection, avoiding smoking, and also adopting a gentle skin care regimen. This can really help with the signs and symptoms of rosacea, and all of those lifestyle measures paired with medical treatments can really improve symptoms and quality of life for rosacea patients.",

        "transcript": "so i made my first video on how i killed my rosacea two years ago and here is me giving you a two years update check-in how am i with my rostatia and if i have experienced any kind of flaring up what kind of products that i'm still using right now and there are other new products that i've introduced in my skincare routine i'm a skincare junkie and i love testing out different skin care products and so i created this channel to share the tips and tricks that i have tried and used on myself something that works something that doesn't work and i normally make different product review as well so if you're interested to know more how you can perfect your skin or what products is good for you make sure you subscribe to my channel and turn on that notification bell so you can support me to make more video like this first of all talk about my rosacea it hasn't been flaring up for me in the past i would say a year my skin barrier becomes much stronger there's no redness there's no flaring up now we're gonna ask what i've learned now that i've managed my rosacea from not flaring up i would say that it's a combination of really having a good skincare routine or products that you use that could help rebuild that skin barrier and the second thing is you know how you are internally now for the products that i have used i have really sticked to the food criteria no essential oil no fragrance and no alcohol it really helped to prevent any further potential irritation for further irritating my skin because when my skin was having flare up when my skin was just not happy i really could not touch those stuff and so i have discovered over time a lot of products that is perfect for people who have sensitive skin and some work some didn't and i have also made videos talking about what works and so if you're interested in knowing more about what kind of skincare product you can use if you have rosacea you can check out those videos one particular skincare product that really helped me repair my skin barrier is the osmosis rescue i've talked about this particular product in another video so you can check it out basically it is a serum that repair my skin barrier i think this is my second or third bottle i really see a huge difference in my redness having to use this on a daily basis while my skin was just flaring up and i see there's a huge difference also in my husband's skin when he was using this product as well looking for a product that has a skincare barrier repairing property is important if you have rosacea or any kind of sensitivity around your skin because whatever is happening on your skin it means that your skin barrier is impaired giving extra effort in repairing that particular skin barrier is important if you have that extra bug make sure you check this product out otherwise you can also stick to cheaper alternatives such as you can look for products that have pentanol centella asiatica ceramides as well all these ingredients helps to repair your skin barrier and i'm gonna list some of the products that have used that contain these ingredients that would good for people who have rosacea or flaring up now what you apply outside is just as important as how you are inside i remember the time i was experiencing tremendous stress and so it became a rosacea for me flaring up and so since then i have taken a very good care of myself internally learning to de-stress learning to increase that awareness of what is triggering that emotions within me because today can be a rosacea tomorrow it could be something related to my other parts of my immune system other parts of my body and so i needed to focus on healing myself internally so what i did i did meditation and also i learned different ways to adjust my own frequency i'm not going to go too much into details on how you can do this but basically when i'm more emotionally triggered it tends to those emotions or those baggages kind of got stuck within my body and so if i don't get rid of them the old messages that got stuck in my body and at the same time if i don't have that awareness moving forward because things are happening around me which i don't have control of so then it is really up to me how i'm going to react to those stuff having that stillness having that calmness to deal with all that really helps to basically build internally much much stronger and so that also helps my rotation from not really flaring up anymore at this point in time however i do keep a very close eye on my skin condition and make sure i don't use anything that's too harsh and you should not use anything that's too harsh anyway so these are the things that i've used and implement or learned throughout my journey of healing my rosacea if you have other questions around how i have healed or any question about the stuff that i've shared just now make sure you leave a comment down below i'm more than happy to answer that and i really understand it is really difficult to heal rosacea when your skin is just so red and i remember at that time i didn't really want to go out to see anybody because i had really bad acne rosacea when i see people people tend to ask me what happened to me and i've reached a point where i don't want to explain myself anymore because me myself was not happy with the situation on my face so i really understand what people are going through or what you are going through if you are watching this video so feel free to leave some questions down below and i'm more than happy if i can get around to all of them to answer uh and so hopefully you can also heal your rosacea and get back to a awesome gorgeous looking skin i'm very happy today i can share my experience with you so if you have enjoyed what i've shared today make sure you subscribe to my channel to social support so that i can make more video like this and i will see you in my next one [Music]",

        "transcript": "I get approached to do lots of talks what I really loved about this one was the notion of of disrupting an idea and the idea that that was disrupted comes from a very personal place for me um I'm an only child I'm super close to my cousin Alexia she's like my sister um when she was a a young teenager though she developed a skin condition called viigo now viigo is an autoimmune condition I and what it does is it depigment the skin so you're left with white patches all over the skin now Alexia has got quite a Mediteranean skin tone like me so you can imagine how that would have looked and I noticed that this affected not just for skin but it affected her as an individual I noticed that it affected people around her the way they spoke to her the way they looked at her I noticed that it affected with her behavior she went from being very bubbly and extroverted to being kind of much more closed off and and not speaking too much I noticed that it was the first thing that people saw about her and questioned her about and so it eventually became the first thing that she saw about herself so I decided when I went off to University that I wanted to study this I wanted to study how it is that the way we look impacts the way we feel now my um my experience where I conceptualize it was very much based on what Alexia had experienced seeing doctors she would say that she'd go in and she'd be asked about whether the skin condition hurt whether it itched you know was it worse in summer was it worse in winter but there was very little about how did it feel when someone stared how did it feel when someone stood back before touching her hand when she mentioned that she was dropping out of swimming classes the question was oh is the chlorine bad for your skin is it is it itchy instead of are you dropping out because people are looking at you differently and armed with this know I thought I really wanted to look at what happens how significant is the way we look on our Behavior so I began to research this area I began speaking to people with skin diseases I began reading about it and in those initial stages one of the things that I I found very quickly Hest people were saying to me you know what I developed my skin condition after a really stressful life event after someone died or my Eczema always seems to get worse right before exam time or I always seem to get that my acne flare when I've had a really bad time with my boyfriend so what I was realizing it's not just the way that we look affects the way that we feel but maybe just maybe the way we feel can affect the way we look and in fact there's a lot of evidence to suggest that this is actually the case the skin and the central nervous system develop out of the same stuff embryologically out of the Ecto right in the beginning right in those first few days of conception there is a connection nerve endings in the skin are in constant contact with your brain so there's that direct connection between the two beyond that the brain and the nervous system can influence the Skin's immune cells through various chemical receptors like neuropeptides for example and there's many studies out there that suggest that stress can interfere with the immune system there's this one quite well-known study done recently that looked at levels of stress preoperatively they found that people with low stress had a higher level of il1 this is an an immune um cell and and what it does is it helps promote healing helps for recovery so people that were less dressed had higher levels so what happened postoperatively they did better they were healthier they left the hospital sooner their wounds healed sooner likewise we know that it can interfere with the the barrier the physical barrier of the skin so the skin is a big part of the immune system and when we're stressed we know that that permeability is compromised and we know that this is the basis of a lot of the skin disorders we see so this might seem like wow this is you know this is really new stuff but actually it's it's not counterintuitive if every time you think about every time you get worried and you blush a little bit or every time you're nervous and you sweat or how about when you've been waiting for that special day and that pimple comes right before that special day we all know that somehow the way we feel affects the function of our skin and we know how it works now so we know the more stressed I get the more cortisol comes into my body higher levels of cortisol higher levels of testosterone higher levels of testosterone more seum production and there's the pimple yeah and the thing is we've understood that lifestyle factors that emotional factors play a part in gastrointestinal systems or or hypertension and I think it's time we start looking at it in the same way that skin disease has the same capacity so this is what I wanted to to research so um I've done many studies in this area over the years but I I want to tell you briefly about one in particular um this was one of my first studies that actually did from my doctoral work and I looked at viigo Alexia's condition and I wanted to see if cognitive behavior therapy which is a kind of therapy that impacts the way we think about things in life in this case our skin disease could reduce stress and then consequently if that reduction could affect body image andell esteem and quality of life so we recruited a group of people and we gave them CBT for 8 weeks another group of people we gave them just talking therapies they could talk about whatever they wanted not about their skin disease not CBT but just um just open-ended therapy and we had another control group the group that received the CBT was able to improve significantly in terms of body image in terms of quality of life and in terms of self-esteem and this was maintained at 6 months in a year but beyond that we actually also saw an improvement a significant Improvement in the skin condition of a lot of those people so we realized that what we' done what we'd managed to do is is address a a central issue in the illness process and an issue that very sadly isn't addressed a lot of times when someone comes in and says I have a skin condition it's it's the condition that's treated not the person and if in fact this connection between mind and body exists and we're not treating it then we're missing something out so what did we learn well we learned that the stories we tell ourselves about the illness matter I've done I've done work in this area as a research scientist as a psychologist for years and what I find when it comes to illness any illness the stories that we tell ourselves why we got to illness what we should do to make it better these will will determine how we act how we seek help how we stick to treatment there was um one guy I remember who came to see me and um he it was July really hot one those sticky London jues and he came and he had his you know shirt done up and his sleeves down and I asked him AR you warm he said well I just I I hate anyone seeing the the viigo we began talking he opened up and explained that he developed viigo around his groin when he was a teenager and so it was mixed up with all these feelings of of Shame and an and sexual confusion and it wasn't until he was able to get therapy and and reframe how he saw the illness and the meanings of the illness that he was able to deal with it emotionally in a much more healthy way but also he was able to regain some of his quality of life back and this is someone who for years after that encounter would write to me and say it's freezing outside but I refuse to take my shorts off because this is my illness and I refuse to be ashamed of it I also learned that the severity of a condition will have no bearing on how an individual experiences it you know we make this assumption that the worse you look the worse you feel but that's not the case it's a really individual thing um I remember working with a dancer once a beautiful girl who came in and she had um exion on her legs and she was devastated by this her identity was so bound up in her legs so you can imagine her sitting across from a doctor that was saying well it's not going to kill you like you know I can't see it so you must be fine it doesn't matter what we see as health professionals what matters is the individual's experience I learned indeed that even though a condition isn't physically handicapping it doesn't mean it's not psychologically handicapping you no psychologically one of the things that we do to protect ourselves is a void so if I decide that this skin condition is something that's going to cause me problems people are going to ask me about it I'm going to feel uncomfortable and I just make my world smaller I decide well I'm not going to date until until it goes away I'm not going to go for the job until it goes away I'm just going to put my life on hold and this is a significant problem because the smaller our our worlds get the more difficult it is to come out of that comfort zone right the only way to improve confidence is to do things that we never thought we could do and illnesses especially those that have this visible Factor get in the way of that many times and finally and really importantly I learned that there is a potential for vicious cycle of skin disease whereby the worse my skin gets the worse I feel and the worst I feel the worse my skin becomes so this is what we learned with this study and ever since then and you know this was like back in God the late 90s when we did this study the future psycho Dermatology really took off there's so many more people working in the area now um there's three permanent posts of psychologist and dermatology units in theuk in fact one of them is held by one of my old PhD students um an an amazing clinician called Alexander mazara now when uh she was doing her PhD with me we did some research so she went to the World free medical school and um as part of that she had such an impact on the department and helping people with their skin conditions that uh that that won an inov an innovation award a clinical Innovation award from the government and since then she's one of the most valued practitioners there I saw her a couple of weeks ago and I told her I was doing this talk and I said how are things going she said well actually we've just had a review of the service and we've had some great stats she said that in the last review 44% of the Dermatology patients had been discharged because of the work that she'd done with them 44% she said 22% had either discontinued or avoided systemic therapies altogether and 18% who are long-term unemployed because of their illness or because of the way they thought about their illness which is key had managed to return back to work so we're you know we're really missing a beat if we don't acknowledge the fact that the way we think impacts the way we feel and we don't start understanding and treating people in a way that allows them to address the things that really matter to them in terms of their illness now when I speak to Alexandra and other collisions in the field and we look at what What patients tell us they tell us five core things one is that they need to have the psychosocial impact address every other illness you have no one will ask you about I can't see if you have an ulcer I can't really see if you have diabetes when you have a skin disease I feel that I can see it so all of a sudden it's not just yours I can ask you I can stare I can wonder whether to touch it or not so knowing how to deal with the stairs the awkward questions is key an acknowledgement of that that is vital understanding indeed how to improve your own lifestyle choices how the reduction of stress can have an impact not just on your emotional health but your physical health is so important developing strategies to deal with uncertainty now this is an important one people talk about the disfiguring component of certain skin diseases but actually there's this out of pressure that it's constantly changing so if I'm living with a scar that's it I know where the scar is I don't wake up tomorrow and it's bigger or it's moved or it's Shredder if I'm living with the skin disease I'm constantly adapting to a changing body image and needing to constantly adapt means to learning to live with that uncertainty and again that's a strategy that needs to be developed as does needing to be encouraged by not being defined by the condition like I said earlier if that's the first thing everybody sees about you you need to remember what you see about yourself this doesn't become definitive of who who you are and finally and really importantly understanding the links between our thoughts and our condition we need to begin to disrupt the way we think about skin disease we need to view it in the same way that we view hypertension that we view ulcers that we view illnesses that or certain are impacted by our mental health I think it was this disruption that allowed those patients in that first PhD research to gain improvements I certainly think it was rethinking her illness that helped my cousin Alexia feel so much better about her condition as well CU she was no longer defined by it and she's much happier with who she is today and I think until we understand that we give it's time we give patients um a sense of entitlement to ask for help that is more holistic until we begin to treat the patient not just the person then we'll never be really looking at the whole story when it comes to skin disease thanks very much [Music]",
