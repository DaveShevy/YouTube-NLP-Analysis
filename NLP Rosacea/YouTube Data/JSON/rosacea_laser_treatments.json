        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

idea who I am subscribe so you know what's good for you but I am a board certified dermatologist and today we are going to be focusing on rosacea because it is the last weekend of rosacea awareness month and I've taken pity on you flushed red human beings out there so we're going to focus on how to better identify your rosacea and help yourself but before I do that make sure you head on over to d r ris.com because I am starting a new newsletter that's going out every week that is purely educational focused from Dr eris.com so we'll be recapping some of the YouTubes we'll be focusing on new topics if you guys have questions make sure to email us at hello.com and we will make sure to incorporate those questions into that newsletter every week so head on over there I will link it below on the screen so back to rosacea what is it what causes it how do you identify it we're going to get in right now rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition it is not acne and I have to start off by saying this because as a Derm I get so annoyed when I see the marketing around ingredients for rosacea as acne but I understand why they do this and I'm going to let you guys in on something take for example sulfur which we're going to talk about in this video in order to get a drug fact label on a sulfur product so you can have a quote unquote medical indication for that ingredient you have to abide by what the FDA sees that ingredient fit for sulfur has traditionally been approved by the FDA for acne so they often write for example on sulfur purpose acne treatment and that's huge for a brand that they can actually say that so they're going to go ahead and run with it but sulfur is traditionally great for rosacea and not necessarily acne so I think in the process the public has gotten confused and started confusing the two and treating rosacea like acne but that is probably the worst thing you can do because it can disrupt your Skin Barrier more and it can inflame your rosacea worse in the process but I wanted you guys to understand this very nuanced thing so that you know as a person that rosacea is truly not acne it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is due to a multitude of different things we actually don't know exactly why you get it we do believe there is a genetic predisposition when you think of Rosa you think of a white person who gets really red but do not assume that darker skin tones can't have rosacea either it is just harder to detect and see but they can absolutely have rosacea too and it's usually due to a multitude of different factors from genetics chronic heat UV exposure a broken Skin Barrier little tiny mites like these called Demodex mites that are just going rampid on your skin we all have them some of us have them a little bit more than others and when they wake up and they're alive they tend to just mess up but deodex mites an overabundance of reactivity in terms of flushing etc etc etc and when you have a little bit of everything The Perfect Storm can show up on your face when you're nervous when you're stressed when you're hot when you're eating spicy foods when you're on a date you name it but there are really if you want to take a step back four main types of rosacea starting with the most common emodal ectatic rosacea Arial means red tantic means blood vessels rosesa is rosesa so when you have somebody who's red with a lot of broken blood vessels all over their face they have one of the most common forms known as the athematic type then you have the one that I think people get confused by that they confuse with adult acne papulo pular rosacea papules and P little red bumps and little tiny bumps all over your face usually along the cheeks the nose maybe a little bit here can sometimes happen along the chin interesting tip and this one's a good one you do not have blackheads in rosacea and with rosacea the nasal labial folds this area is spared so if you're having all of a sudden a breakout right here around your mouth it's probably not rosacea if it affects your nasal laal folds then you have the the third type which is like your old white uncle that you just can't or maybe you love or you just don't really like I don't know maybe I'm projecting but you have Fus rosacea where when you have chronic inflammation right and enlarged sweat glands the skin can appear thicker and your pores can look enlarged and your nose starts to get really distended and honestly deformed over time it can happen to your nose it can happen to your chin it can happen to your forehead that's the Fus type then the fourth type is ocular rosacea which people often Overlook completely but the eyes are usually affected in 50% of rosacea sufferers and what do you get with that you get blefaritis so inflammation along the eyelid margins you can get redness of the white part of your eye you have to take an eye hygiene into consideration but also when your eyes are affected and they're chronically inflamed especially the lid margins you want to calm that inflammation down so you don't f up your eyeballs in the process and have scratches on your corneil so that's usually an oral medication and that's why you shouldn't be scared of going on systemic medications but you should probably also see an opthalmologist and let them know about it so how can you then help yourself first without going into any sort of over-the-counter products or even prescription medications or in office treatments there's lifestyle and the things associated with lifestyle you're not going to like but this is the hard truth hot showers no steam no all of you weirdos love Hot Yoga that Take 5 hours to go in and out to actually do I tried doing it one year and I died no we don't do hot yoga spicy food I mean everything in moderation okay every once in a while it's fine but if you're going to eat like chili peppers with every meal you're going to mess up your Rosa alcohol caffeine chocolate a lot of chocolate can affect stress yes we need to start meditating in the morning certain medications the list goes on and on and on so you really do have to start listening to your skin and understanding how you're reacting to certain triggers whether it is sitting out in the sun or going into a hot yoga room or doing a steam or a sauna etc etc cooking maybe it's a perfect excuse for you not to cook and so you guys get the gist right make it work to your benefit so what are then the top ingredients that we can incorporate into our routine if we have rosacea and we're trying to help ourselves and I'm going to look for things that are calming and soothing that are going to help restore our Skin Barrier that are going to reduce inflam and that are basically Beyond The Gentle basic skin care that we think of when we think of basic sensitive skin like Cal oatmeal panol Etc glycerin we want to look for ingredients that are going to actively help reduce the look of that is the correct way of saying it if you are in the industry because you can't claim that it's reducing inflammation it's helping reduce the look of inflammation and redness number one and this is probably the most popular one on the market that I think a lot of Ros of people know about and look for directly Santella atica Santella atica is known for redness reducing properties anti-inflammatory properties it has atico sdes medas aides and aziatic acid in it which all have anti-inflammatory effects and it reduces the look of inflammation it has been shown also just side note to promote collagen production so and it also has certain antioxidants that can protect the skin from the damage caused by free radicals obviously full disclosure my brand the depuffer why do I love this product if you have rosacea because it is loaded in centella asiatica but it also has arnica and arnica is not one that is traditionally thought of for rosacea but it works like a charm because it helps reduce the redness and calms the inflammation in a synergistic way that your skin looks def flushed within a couple of minutes when done correctly at the right concentration arnica is tricky though because when you guys look for arnica products more often than not they're diluted in a homeopathic fashion this one is purely Brown because it is pure arnica the color that you guys see here this golden hue is due to the high concentration of arnica in this formulation then you have one that a lot of people with rosacea know about Dr jart Dr jart has his tiger grass which is another name for cantella asiatica color correcting treatment it's a mineral sunscreen with zinc and titanium and it has a green tint to it and a more opaque fashion versus this that is going to help neutralize the look of redness because when you're red you want green to block the red we're not going to go into the art of it take an art course that's not my jam although I do like painting number two we have sulfur I hinted at sulfur at the beginning of this video sulfur is going to be marketed as an acne treatment I.E like on this when you see eradicate daily foaming cleanser acne treatment because it has 3% sulfur but it's not really just an acne treatment it's a rosacea treatment why because sulfur helps to minimize inflammation it regulates seen production a lot of people with rosacea have a lot of overproduced seim think of the nose think of the chin and it also helps to minimize inflammation as well it has antimicrobial properties which is helpful right but not the main reason of why it works and it has mild exfoliating properties but it's not going to over strip you and Break Your Skin Barrier worse making your rosacea flare up in the process there's another product by pieter Thomas Roth they have a 10% sulfur clay mask which is much more potent than the cleanser form and then you have one available at your local drugstore called Dela Cruz where you can literally spend a couple of bucks smell like a rotten egg and improve your skin in the process so those are the sulfur products that are high up at number two when it comes to ingredients number three is AAL acid AAL acid is an ingredient that I have a honestly more of a love love relationship with a little bit of a hate because it's not elegant it pills and it messes up a formula when you mix it with other actives at the right% and in order to use aoic acid if you have rosacea you really want to be at 10% or above but above that is prescription and prescription is 15% which is sweet spot and I don't know how the prescription is formulated but it's so elegant finaa is so elegant and I do not get paid by that drug company whatsoever um but it's a 15% prescription on to over the- counter though we have paa choice this is a 10% AIC acid booster I believe um it has a little bit of licorice it does have salicylic acid I don't know the percent of Sal acid in this if you're sensitive or you think your barrier is inflamed beware don't go for it because the Sal acid might mess you up but AIC acid like I said regul Ates your anti-inflammatory properties and antibacterial properties and it helps as an antioxidant as well Dr Sam bunting across the pond in the UK has her Flawless nightly serum which is a 10% aoic acid serum as well it has 5% niacinamide it does have a Ester form of vitamin C at 2% so it's not going to be the active form of vitamin C but it might be a nice one if you are a rosacea sufferer trying to use vitamin see in the morning wanting to get away with some AIC acid I hear beautiful things I started looking into it because of you guys dming me about it so that is hers and then the ordinary this one's great at night when you have nowhere to go and you don't care who you're seeing it is a 10% a acid suspension you do kind of sometimes have to shake it I feel but it appears nice and elegant but it does pill after a while so do not be fooled by the first impression with this it's 11 bucks though so you not really go wrong and then like I said prescription number four hypochlorous acid you guys have started hearing about this all over Instagram Tik Tok YouTube I don't know what else you guys are on I can't keep up with the social media platforms but hypochlorous acid is one that has been used in medicine for decades I actually use it before every cosmetic procedure to clean my patients faces because it has antimicrobial effects and it is gentle so it's not going to over strip their skin like using plain oil isopropyl alcohol or an alcohol wipe it is now available in fancier forms at nicer stores but you can also get it at your local drugstore as a generic this is one that is available at Walgreens it is really not that expensive at all and you can use it every day on your face in the morning and at night if you're somebody who wears a mask for whatever reason at the height of the pandemic I used to spray my mask with hypoc chloris acid to minimize the breakout around the mouth area number five this is one that people don't often think of when they have rosacea a lot of people with rosacea think they have chronically dry skin over here it's always flaking but then when I ask my patients is your skin dry or oily they go it's more oily but it flakes okay it's not dry skin it's not flaking because it's dry it is a yeast living on your skin and you have dandruff of your face a lot of rosacea patients have dandruff of their face around their eyebrows right here in the corners of their nose or even along their eyelid margins and you can even see it sometimes in front of their ears and they need ketoconazol neral shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp that you can use a couple of times a week on your face to keep that yeast at Bay okay um it's an anti-fungal medicine that can help really help your face and I think when that is sort of subsided and you calm the subar dermatitis down you minimize the inflammation associated with it and your redness gets better in the long run so this is something that you're going to have to incorporate throughout the course of your life and you have to figure out the Cadence of how you want to incorporate it the shampoo is not necessarily the best as a face wash because it's not the ideal pH it might be a little bit stripping but if you use it several times periodically maybe twice a week maybe it's four times a week maybe it's once a week I don't know what the right Cadence is for you and you do it in the areas that are actually the worst letting it sit for a few minutes before washing it off you will see a huge difference in your skin in the long run also just side note I use the shampoo right here I've been using it right here when I wash my hair I let it sit for 5 minutes not because I have dandruff but because I have thinning hair there and I have noticed that my hair is starting to get thicker poor AI okay number six benzil peroxide and you're going to go wait wait wait wait wait is benzil peroxide and adne medication yes it is is it great for rosacea no it's not but if you have this little Mite called a Demodex Mite out of control on your face then benzil peroxide can be helpful for you now not all rosacea people have Demodex mites going crazy on their face but a lot of them do and the way I hear it described from my patients is that they feel like their skin is a little bit reactive and itchy not painful not irrit ated but just like this is probably the get your mind out of the gutter okay but this is probably the best action I can describe it as okay but benzil peroxide can help kill it now you don't need a 10% benzil peroxide wash stronger isn't better something like at 5% we have this in my office is great it's going to help kill that bacteria the little mites and keep it at Bay all right FYI because of the drug fact label benzil peroxide comes up as acne but this can be helpful for Demodex mites as well okay number seven my favorite zinc oxide no it's not sunscreen I'm talking about diaper rash cream Triple Paste zinc oxide is a beautiful ingredient it has anti-inflammatory effects when a kid has a rash down there you slap this all over their little tushies in a gentle way in order to minimize their rash to calm the inflammation down so they have less friction Etc on their privates when it comes to your face if you have an inflamed Skin Barrier and you're trying to restore your barrier zinc oxide can really help restore that barrier and when it comes in the form of a diaper rash cream when it's married to petrolatum it will help create an occlusive layer while calming any inflammation down and it works wonders as an overnight mask treatment especially in a dry climate or in a very cold climate or when the temperatures are changing not all diaper rash creams are created equal don't go for one with essential oils definitely don't and make sure there's no steroid in it cuz that can make things worse I was sponsored by this company after I spoke about them it was a very organic thing and that's why I took that sponsorship because I was like how funny Would it be that the one sponsorship I'm excited about is a buttpaste company but this is probably my favorite one not because of that sponsorship I have two kids who are six and four I wasn't sponsored then but this was the one that I used on my kids so that is the diaper rash cream k for that and then we're going to talk about options for quickly prescriptions but we're not going to waste too much time on this because you can't prescribe medications for yourselves at least not as of yet but who knows what the future holds but aik acid 15% that's great you want to incorporate that metronidazol is a topical antibiotic that you guys can use it's been very well studied for rosacea it is also beautiful and santra which is the trade name the generic name is itin is an antiparasitic that also kills Demodex I often times prescribe all three and I tell patients go plop ploop ploop put three dots mix mix mix apply to face twice a day and it really does help a lot with people with rosacea to help keep all of it at Bay and you can use this long term you can use aoic acid when you're pregnant you can use metronidazol when you're pregnant and last I checked you can use cilantro when you're pregnant in office we can take it up a notch and you guys can really help yourselves by reducing the Cosmetic look of redness by getting the beams vascular laser beams also pulse known as the pulse die laser which in my book is the gold standard you guys might get Groupon deals for ipls or bbls for rosacea it doesn't work as well an IPL and a BBL is a light it is not a laser you're going to need a lot more treatments and you better be going to somebody who is qualified because you might get burnt in the process because they are not as specific as a laser and you need to know what you're doing with them in order to treat your rosacea correctly and then if you have enlarged sweat glands on your nose or on your chin you can do electr surgery you can shave it down people actually use sandpaper believe it or not in conjunction with other devices and lasers to help minimize the look of that but you're probably not watching this video I am assuming if that is your case and you have timeus changes on your nose um because it's usually older white men who get that so I don't think they're watching this YouTube um but that is pretty much what we can do the bird ey view in office and the last thing I want to just say is rosacea might appear like a very benign chronic condition but it has a really deep psychological influence and psychosocial impact on people knowing that you're flushing when you're embarrassed makes you more embarrassed and makes it worse as somebody who has had 10 V beams in one year yes 10 why because I would go to the gym and I would get stopped on the street when I was working out and they would ask me do you need to go to the hospital are you okay cuz I looked like a beat I wasn't red I was like purple red and so I told myself let me just treat this with the vbm and I ended up doing 10 one year and I maintain it probably with one or two treatments a year now I treat my whole face it is really psychologically draining thinking oh my God are my emotions showing on my face and my ears so don't just down for rosacea awareness month and if you guys have any questions or comments as always leave them below but I hope you have a beautiful Saturday [Music]",

        "transcript": "How can lasers help Facial Rosacea? Welcome to Dr. Scheiner\u2019s Medical Minute. Today we\u2019re going to talk about ways to\nhelp treat Facial Rosacea. Rosacea is a very common skin condition. It starts with a tendency to flush more easily\nthat other individuals. It can then evolve into redness on the nose,\ncheeks, chin and forehead. Some patients get bumps on their face associated\nwith the rosacea and it can also affect the eyelids resulting in dry eye. The causes for rosacea are not known but it tends to\nrun in families with fair skin. It often flares with triggers such as exercise,\nsun exposure, hot weather, stress, spicy food, alcohol and hot baths. Treatments include low dose doxycycline and\ncertain skin creams. New lasers and light sources have the ability\nto close the abnormal vessels resulting in a cleaner complexion in patients with Rosacea. Broad based light and 1064 laser treatments\nare both effective in helping to close those vessels. But, while rosacea can be controlled and managed,\nit can not be cured currently. The vessels in rosacea are similar to a hedge\nthat grows in our yards. The hedges can be trimmed and over time they\nregrow. Rosacea acts in a similar way. It usually takes 2-4 initial treatments to\nget the dilated vessels under control. Then it would require retreatment every 3-4\nmonths to maintain that control. Take a look at these photos of patients who\nhad BBL and 1064 laser treatments to help their rosacea. Notice the improvement. If you or someone you know are suffering with\nrosacea consider seeking help by a surgeon who has these laser devices. I hope you found this interesting and I invite\nyou come back and watch again for our next medical minute. Goodbye for now and I wish each of you a beautiful\nday.",

        "transcript": "hi guys April is rosacea awareness month and if you have the skin condition you are in good company because Millions suffer from rosacea myself included I'll let you in on a little secret I did not film any videos last week because I was actually getting my treatment for rosacea which is something I do a few times a year it's a laser treatment called pulse Dye Laser also known as PDL and it can help with that flushing and redness that you get with rosacea I particularly get it on my nose and on my cheeks so it's not a particularly painful procedure but it's not comfortable either it's kind of like somebody sitting there snapping a rubber band in your face um for about you know three to five minutes here's a photo of me right after walking back to my car here's a pic at day one whoa swelling here's day two and here's day three here I am a week later most of the swelling has gone down there's some really slight erythema that mostly can be covered with makeup now usually it takes several weeks to actually notice a difference it takes a little bit for this to work oftentimes multiple treatments are necessary spaced at least a month apart and the results are not permanent so oftentimes you'll still need to get regular treatments every year in order to maintain the results so these type of lasers and other light treatments like IPL work relatively well for this particular type of rosacea called erythamato telangic tatic rosacea and that generally means you just have flushing maybe some enlarged blood vessels primarily nose cheeks maybe chin upper lip sometimes forehead in this video I'm going to discuss the different types of rosacea and different treatment options if you're just tuning in I'm Dr Abby Waldman I'm a dermatologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston so the exact cause of rosacea is unknown but is thought to be some component of environmental factors plus genetic factors there are several triggers that are known to cause flare-ups of rosacea those can include sunlight spicy food lots of caffeine intake stress exercise hot cold weather I know for me exercise and cold and hot weather are definitely triggers for my rosacea there are some recent studies that show a correlation between gastrointestinal diseases and rosacea so those who have common GI problems like Crohn's disease celiac disease ulcerative colitis IBS small intestinal bacterial overgrowth suggesting that there's some link between skin health and gut health but I definitely think more research is needed in this Arena identifying and avoiding the triggers can help reduce flares of your rosacea so I mentioned that I suffer from erythematodectatic rosacea which is just a tendency to flush and have enlarged blood vessels another type of rosacea is popular pustular type which tends to have pimples and pustules on the the nose and cheeks primarily and it can even mimic acne vulgaris the typical acne that you think of you could have a type of rosacea called ocular rosacea which involves drying of the eyes redness itching and even forming lots of little styes little bumps on the lower eyelid 5 minutes rosacea is a form where there's a body part that actually gets big and swollen especially as you get older and older the primary form is rhinophyma where your nose becomes enlarged and the tissue kind of becomes spongy granulomatous rosacea is a really severe form of rosacea there's no cure for rosacea but there are lots of medications available that can help with symptoms in addition to the laser and light treatments I mentioned for the flushing there are several topical medications that can help with flushing including brimonidine and oxymetozoline those are temporary measures they reduce redness by vasoconstricting the blood vessels and so they're a good way like before going to an event to reduce redness but they're not going to be a long-term solution other topical medications that can be prescribed or metronidazole azelaic acid and Ivermectin oral antibiotics can be prescribed to reduce inflammation oftentimes these are prescribed at low doses for really long periods of time in addition to medication you want to be super diligent about Sun Sun is a common trigger and really makes this worse if you're sensitive to sunscreen which sometimes can be the case if you have rosacea then you want to find something really gentle oftentimes you will tolerate a mineral based sunscreen more than chemical based sunscreens but really just finding one that works for you and being able to use it consistently is going to help quite a bit and then when you're really out in the sun you want to wear big broad rimmed hat you want to stay out of the direct sunlight with a cover and you want to wear protective clothing you want to avoid using harsh irritating ingredients in your skin care that being said I do know that oftentimes people really can tolerate a retinoid or a retinol but you just might have to go Go real real slow to introduce that and you want to wait until after any flare is gone and then start it once your skin is all clear and then really really slowly introduce a retinoid it actually has been shown that it could help um minimize the flares of the rosacea but if you use it while you're having a flare oftentimes it can just be a little bit too much a little bit too irritating going through it myself I know that it can be really frustrating managing rosacea there are several treatment options available and you want to seek advice from your dermatologist if

        "transcript": "nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city and welcome to my youtube channel where literally every week we debunk a skincare myth we do a deep dive into an ingredient story we try to understand different skin conditions and how you can help yourself at home but what's very interesting is i have received a lot of questions from you guys in the comments section about what are in-office procedures that could be helpful to us especially when it is surrounding skin redness fine lines and hyperpigmentation so i thought to myself that we would do something a little bit different today and we would actually go into an exam room and into a treatment room and actually treat a patient together trying to tackle all of the above in one so without further ado let's dive in so the main skin concerns that you guys always ask me about are fine lines pigmentation and redness and we have spoken at length about how you guys can help yourselves at home but the truth is skin care can only do so much at a certain point you might need a boost or you might need a needle or you might need an extra laser treatment in order to get to the end result that you want and that's okay as long as you recognize that you are doing your part and really working with your skin in order to achieve your goal so in office my goal is to try to help you guys get there to jump start it or to finesse what you guys have already achieved through your skincare product use i'm not here to tell you guys that you need laser procedures in office but i'm here to say that laser treatments in office are a perfect adjunct to really intensify the results that you guys are getting from your skin care at home which was funny because there was one comment once from a person saying oh idris just basically promotes skin care and acts like she doesn't do anything in office when that's absolutely not true i've always said that the complement of the two is the perfect marriage because what you can't get from skin care you get from a boost from an office laser treatment but laser treatments alone are never going to give you long-term results if you're not doing your part at home with skincare so it really is the perfect ying to the yang now in office you guys are asking me about those three components fine lines redness and pigmentation so i was thinking of to myself what do i offer here in my practice that can target all three of those different components in a single treatment session because there are lasers that address each one of those specific skin concerns but how can we target all three of them at once it is through the use of two treatment modalities and before i jump into those two treatment modalities let's take a quick step back so lasers are a broad term that everybody uses but is often used incorrectly a laser is technically a single wavelength of light that targets an endpoint and usually the endpoint is one of three things red blood cells for redness pigmentation for brown spots and water for collagen production they are extremely specific and light and ipl also known as intense pulsed light is not a laser it's a light treatment and an ipl is interesting because it can hit various wavelengths at once targeting one of the three two of the three or all three of the three at once the downside of the ipl is that it's not as specific as the laser but you can get a little bit of everything in one and that's like washing a wall before you paint it and third is heat energy based devices utilizing either radio frequency or ultrasound energy heat in order to contract and tighten which can help with the crinkling the crepiness and the fine line production so now that you have a basic overview when you're trying to target redness brown spots and fine lines a laser alone is not going to hit all three of those things so marrying an ipl to a heat energy based device can help you target all three of those in order to boost your at-home skincare regimen and in my practice i offer what i call a smooth glow treatment in which i combine a treatment an ipl treatment with radio frequency through micro needling so you are both evening out your skin tone and tightening your collagen at once so i'm going to jump in and share with you guys various clips of a patient that has allowed me to record one of her three sessions we have done on this patient now three sessions over the last three months based one month apart of the smooth glow treatment and i recorded i believe this was probably my first or my second session with her and she has given me consent to utilize these videos for this video so without further ado this is an example of the patient receiving the first part of the smooth glow treatment as you can see her eyes are covered and she has a thin layer of gel protecting her face the gel is there not just to protect her face from the heat of the intense pulsed light but also to deliver a more even energy across her skin now ipl devices there are many different machines and devices on the market but they're not all equally effective and this is a very important point because unlike a laser an ipl is a multitude of wavelengths whereas a laser is a single wavelength and can be calibrated to that single wavelength and ipl is so many different wavelengths that it's very very important that the device is specific with the filters in delivering the specific wavelength of light to target one of the three end targets that we talked about pigmentation redness or collagen so personally my personal favorite device is this one by luminous that i just showed you guys it is one that i have used for over a decade to be very honest this is obviously the more the newer version on the market it is the luminous the m22 um and i love it because it is not only consistent in the results it is also patient safe because the biggest risk with an ipl is burning given the intensity of the pulsed light and if the wavelength is not specific with the filters and you use it on a darker skin tone the risk of pigmenting because of a burn gets higher so you have to be very very very very um picky as a consumer as to which ipl device you're you're seeking out and the one that i love for my patients is this one by luminous so that is the first part of the treatment you're going to feel i would best describe it if you are slightly you know claustrophobic that intensity can be a little bit intimidating and overwhelming once the light is pulsed and you do feel that heat but the gel is cooling and the tip of the ipl device is a piece of glass that actually cools as well so you're not actually burning it is a non-ablative non-invasive treatment once that treatment is done we wipe off the gel completely and then we go into the micro needling radio frequency portion of the treatment and this one i have in office also by luminous their legend produce fully understand how radiofrequency works and understanding of the skin structure is important and the most important thing here is collagen collagen is a protein molecule not only found in our skin but also found in our muscles in our bones and in our tendons but collagen is what gives our skin the structural support it needs to look firm and plump and give it that tighter looking appearance now it is found in the dermis of our skin the part underneath the epidermis so it's giving us that support as you can see in this video we are stamping the patient's face slowly over time and this is helping deliver control amounts of radio frequency energy into that top layer of the dermis and this form of energy produces heat and this heat penetrates your collagen to not only contract and tighten it but also to stimulate more collagen production over time but collagen takes time and so the results of these treatments do take up to six months for full effect now what is a patient to anticipate after each treatment you're going to be really red i think more pink from the microneedling portion of the treatment not so the ipl portion and you're going to feel a little bit bumpy and grainy but that is going to heal over the course of four to five days in order for the full results to be achieved you're gonna have to wait the full six months because like anything good in life good results take time but this is where you utilizing the right skin care as an adjunct is super important so what kind of post treatment tips do i recommend within that first week of healing when you're going to feel a little bit bumpy from the microneedling itself and you're going to be a little bit more red your whole goal is to soothe and calm your skin down you want to use very very gentle products so we're going to wash with a very very gentle cleanser i love the vana cream cleanser for this reason because it is extremely basic that being said this is not the time when you're going to be using major major makeup that you have to really use a stronger cleanser to get that makeup off so very very light makeup throughout the day so that vine cream can just be enough for you number two you want to use a very gentle moisturizer i love aveeno's calm and restore moisturizer for this reason i think it is extremely soothing and calming because it is loaded with colloidal oatmeal and it has panthenol in it and it is hydrating enough if you need something more then biafine is also a great one to add post procedurally to help with skin healing because we have created tiny wounds through the process of microneedling and third sunscreen sunscreen is paramount it is key you definitely need to be including a sunscreen in your skincare routine if you have very sensitive skin and i think just any time you're breaking the skin barrier a physical sunscreen with zinc or titanium is preferred over a mineral one i personally get very sensitive especially around my eyes with mineral sunscreens so i love the one by isdin there i'm going to butcher how i say this erie futona ageless ultra light tinted mineral spf because it doesn't look cakey especially that your skin is going to feel more textured post treatment in the first week so what do you need to avoid i would avoid exfoliating with a chemical exfoliant you're going to be burning and over tingling and you might irritate your skin more and i would definitely avoid a retinol in the first week post-treatment to avoid any sort of and to minimize any sort of irritation and to make your skin that would make your skin more inflamed so i would have definitely avoid those two and keep it just very simple and very basic with a wash a moisturizer and sunscreen like i said three treatments is usually what i recommend for patients so we really give them the full result but i say do three and then stop and see and stop and see at least for six months so we can see what you look like six months post treatment compared to when you started um this is also when your skin care game needs to be at its peak um post treatment to really give yourself the chance of getting the best results from the treatment itself so you want to focus it on not only hydrating and soothing ingredients but you also want to gear your treatment to evening out your pigmentation and we've done a full video on that prior but you guys can always scroll back to watch that and to how to build a stronger foundation so including retinols including growth factors including peptides to help your skin build a stronger foundation over time and the end results are really supposed to be a better more rested smoother and brighter looking you um and that can only happen with a combination of not just the laser treatment but also your efforts with your skin care products to recap here are pictures of the patient before during and after her treatments the series of three where you can see the clear difference in her skin so i hope you guys enjoyed this video where we kind of took it a little bit into the exam room to show you guys the full effect of what a laser quote-unquote treatment is utilizing a light device the ipl the one by luminous and the legend pro which is their micro needling and radio frequency combination so i hope you guys enjoyed it and if you guys want to know more about other treatments that i offer in office or you want to know more about other laser treatments that i may not offer in office but i'm happy to speak about please leave comments below and we will address in an upcoming video have a great saturday [Music] you",

        "transcript": "laser like PDL and light treatments like IPL can be effective in reducing redness and flushing with verace but which one should you choose IPL vers PDL I'm dermatologist Dr Abby Waldman from bring and Women's Hospital in Boston and I going to walk you through the two different treatments for rosacea and I even going to get these two treatments one on one side of my face and the other on the other side so that you can directly compare them so let's get to it so first things before we get the treatment you have to know that one neither treatment is going to be a oneandone cure after one treatment both are going to require several treatments usually somewhere between 3: and 4 with IPL it can be even more and then you may need one or two treatments every year for maintenance these treatments are typically spaced about 4 weeks apart two you cannot get any sun 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after and by any sun I mean if you are out in the sun you better have the widest Brim hat on you better be trying to stay out of the direct sunlight that's because any sunlight is going to increase redness so it's basically going to negate the treatment that you just got and even in some situations can lead to more complications more redness and more hyperpigmentation so just avoid the sun when you book it look at your calendar make sure you're not going anywhere Sunny these treatments are safe in all skin colors and skin types but do talk to your doctor or your provider who's doing the laser light treatment about any health concerns you might have any bleeding disorders so that you kind of know what to expect and then there are some autoimmune disorders that may be a relative contraindication for getting laser so make sure to bring up any sort of autoimmune disorders that you might have okay so first I am going to be getting PDL I'm going to get it on my left side of my face and what does PDL mean PDL is pulse Dye Laser it can also go by its brand name which is vbeam and these lasers emit a wavelength of 585 or 595 nanm and that targets blood vessels and redness but it's also shown to help with melasma and scars the settings your provider uses will really dictate where that laser is going to go how deep it's going to penetrate into the skin and what size vessels it can hit okay so I'm going to be getting the PDL laser on the left side of my face here and I'm going to be getting the IPL treatment on the right side of my face that way you can compare them directly so first your provider is going to remove any makeup any dirt any sunscreen that you have on usually with alcohol or a face cleanser you will wear protective eye goggles those glasses are key to protecting your eyes your provider will also wear their own type of filtered glasses which protect their eyes when using the laser because of any possible eye danger unless you're a young child you're unlikely going to be able to bring a family family member or friend into the room but if you do have someone enter the room just know that they will also need protective eyewear pulse Dy laser feels like somebody is snapping a rubber band in your face it's not exactly painful but it's not comfortable either you can actually see me winse every time I get a little pulse it's just surprises you a little bit because no one really likes having a rubber band snapped right in their face to do one side of my face it takes about several minutes a few minutes so to do the whole face expect it to take upwards of 10 minutes the discomfort is greatest usually in the underside of the nose and the upper lip it's least painful in the cheek area and the forehead ideally you should not get numbing medication beforehand because the numbing medication actually reduces flushing and redness and can thus reduce the effect of the laser the laser again is targeting just the redness and so the more you actually are red the better it's going to work you might even like flush up your skin a little bit like go on a jog right beforeand hand because the redder your skin is the more that laser has to Target so anything that makes it less red is going to make it less effective so I advise if you can tolerate the discomfort to do it without any numbing medication cuz you're just going to get a better effect you can bring like a squeezy ball to distract you you know hold on to the chair whatever you need to do in order to sort of distract yourself again it's over pretty quickly afterwards you can apply Vaseline for discomfort ice you can take Tylenol if you want so overall in terms of pain for PDL you know not the worst not exactly something you're going to want to do in your free time on the weekend so moving on to IPL so personally I'd actually never received IPL before this I have had rosacea for many many years I underwent treatment with PDL and now I usually do PDL once or twice a year just as maintenance especially as my Skin's getting I notice it getting like a little bit redder maybe flushing more then I'll do my once or twice a year PD so I'd actually never received IPL so what is IPL it is intense pulse light it also goes by the brand named BBL you may have heard it being called a photo facial IPL is not a laser so it is a light treatment meaning it's a broad wavelength of light and then your provider will put in a filter that filters through the wavelength that you want to use so for instance if you want to Target redness and flushing you're going to put in a filter that lets through a wavelength similar to the PDL that 585 595 so that that goes through and targets the redness but it's less focused than PDL a laser which has all the wavelengths coming at one spot all together at the same time so here I am getting IPL on the right side of my face you'll see you'll wear very similar goggles to protect your eyes you'll wash your skin the same way that you did before the PDL and likely your provider will be wearing ing some sort of protective eyewear as well so unlike the pulse D laser which felt kind of like a snapping I was actually surprised that the IPL hurt so much it feels like burning it was much worse on my forehead than it was on the rest of my face but I actually would consider even taking a Tylenol the day of if I got this again because I was surprised how much it hurt and of course it's over very quickly you know just doing one side of my face took a few minutes so certainly nothing to write home about but in comparison for the PDL and the IPL I'm going to go ahead and say that IPL was more painful of course pain is subjective right everyone's going to experience pain in a different way of course I knew what to expect with PDL having received many PDL treatments in the past and so that might have biased how I interpreted that pain I very much knew what to expect with the PDL and I didn't know what to expect with the IPL so what about redness and swelling after the procedure so here are some photos immediately after the procedure when I was just driving home or about to drive home this is 2 days after and this is 3 days after so if you look you notice significantly more swelling and redness on the left side of my face where I had the PDL when compared to the right side of my face where I had the IPL overall the swelling is quite mild really you're going to be the only one who really notices it I think I did every single event and activity I was planning on doing I went running I think I went to a dinner that night next day you know I went to work no one mentioned anything so it's certainly not anything that you're going to have downtime for I guess I wouldn't do it right before you have like a national TV you know appearance or you're getting married so I mean you're going to have some swelling of redness I guess I was surprised how little I had on the IPL side on the right side really very minimal maybe a little bit like underneath the eyes for a day and then that was it whereas the PDL side had a little bit of swelling and redness for up to 3 or 4 days after so in the post-procedure time I would definitely say that PDL had more redness and swelling compared to IPL what about other side effects so bruising is a side effect that's described for both I have never had bruising I think that's usually if you use very very targeted settings almost aimed at getting bruising the more bruising you have the more effect it has has that being said the bruising is very significant if you get it and it can last a long time so most of the time at least these days I find that providers don't use what are called peric settings meaning bruising settings because people don't really want that really significant bruising for several weeks how about other side effects you know I did notice with the PDL on the left side I had more of the rosacea pimples a week out um and I didn't have the them on the right side it's really hard to say if that was related to the laser I also sleep on the left side so that can be a confounding factor and they were all gone by 2 weeks so hard to say that it was related um one kind of surprising side effect I had from the IPL was that when I was getting the IPL she hit an area of hair right up in my hairline and it singed it it burned it which you can see here and that those little hairs actually fell out so now I have a teeny tiny little bald spot you can't even really see it from here you know I can notice it but the good thing is is that's unlikely to be permanent because that wavelength doesn't really Target the hair follicle so the hairs are likely to grow back also it's pretty small also that's totally a user dependent error meaning if no one hits your hairline that's not going to happen but it just goes to show how targeted the laser is opposed to the IPL which you're just using a filter and it might hit some other things on the way like a hair follicle so I guess for other side effects you know again there weren't much nothing that I'm really writing home about but I guess it was kind of annoying to have that little like singed area of hair so I would say IPL had a little more in terms of other side effects to consider but again those are going to be pretty user dependent so what about long-term results right that's why you're getting this you don't want redness you don't want swelling flushing so here I am at 6 weeks after and my skin looks great honestly I think I've had a lot less flushing a lot less redness here are some photos I really can't notice a big difference between the two sides the little pimples on my cheeks that I usually get here and there completely gone so I'd say 6 weeks out equivocal outcomes and that's been shown in studies where side-by-side comparison generally have pretty equivocal outcomes in terms of controlling redness for rosacea now there's some suggestion that the PDL may have more sustained effects meaning you might get like a longer term effect than the IPL which could suggest you might need more IPL treatments in order to sustain the same result obviously it's too early at 6 weeks for me to see side by side you know obviously it's 6 weeks they both look great but it's possible down the line that the redness would start coming back faster on one side than the other based on those studies so in terms of outcomes side by side I would say in terms of one week outcome probably the IPL had a slightly better onewe outcome again cuz I was still having like these little pimples on the PDL side hard to know if that was exactly really due to the PDL in terms of six weeks outcome I think they're equal and it's a tie but I will point out one thing that IPL PDL these are not video games these are not something that you can learn in a weekend course it is pretty complicated physics and there are preset settings on these machines but they are purposely very low risk and so if someone's doing your procedure and they're not really experienced in using these machines you're likely to get no effect and that's actually what I hear more often than having had side effects and complications from these procedures is actually having no reaction no effect from these procedures because someone did it who didn't really know what they were doing and so just be aware of that when you are looking for a provider you know really favor board-certified dermatologist plastic surgeon physician or other provider who really has extensive experience with these lasers and light treatments because although side effects are pretty rare it's actually more likely you're just going to kind of throw away money by having someone do it with too low settings settings that just aren't really going to do anything so really ask your provider like how often do you do it for redness and and rosacea you can also ask around friends on message boards you can go on the ASDS website which has lists of providers of procedural dermatologists in your area and you can call their offices to kind of get a sense of what they use all of this is to say that it's not a one- siiz fits-all and certainly like in a medy spa where the training might not be as good as like in a clinic setting you may not get the same results from even the same machine okay so the last thing we'll discuss is cost so what's the cost difference between these now obviously A lot's going to go into cost um it's going to be dependent on where you live you know in New York is going to be more expensive than Wyoming it's going to depend on what area you're treating if you're just treating your cheeks versus your whole face it's going to depend on the inflation it's going to depend on where you get your treatment so again the medic Spa is probably going to be cheaper than a clinic or hospital setting but the reason you're going to want to know about cost is it is very rare for insurance to cover this it's almost always an outof pocket cost of course I'm speaking from a United States Insurance view I don't know in other countries whether or not it's covered by insurance but I do know in the US it is extremely rare for it to be covered even though rosacea is a medical condition I guess they consider it just cosmetic so first for IPL so for IPL it's going to run you about $300 to $600 per treatment so looking at that first initial series of treatments you know you're looking at a few thousand also for PDL pretty similar but maybe a little more expensive at around 400 to800 approximately and again these are in Us doll so again kind of equivalent but PDL is going to set you back a little bit more now of course you know you really have to ask about the number of treatments that you think you'll need everyone is different you may need just a few you may need more so that's going to really come into play when you're kind of trying to calculate the cost so the winner is honestly it's really close and I think it's going to depend a lot on your priorities I think IPL was the clear winner in terms of immediate postprocedure side effects IPL had way less swelling way less redness honestly I barely noticed I had have anything done on that side it may be a little bit cheaper but on the other hand the PDL was slightly less painful or at least I'm used to that type of weird discomfort and it could be worth that little initial redness and swelling in the post-operative time frame if the results may be more prolonged as the studies say regardless of which you choose hopefully at least now you know what to expect you know what questions to ask your provider you know how to look for a provider who's going to give you great results check out this video If you're

actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big overview of rosacea what it is all the different types Medical Treatments that I recommend and then also a full AM and PM skincare routine please let me know if you have any questions let me know what you think of this video below please please don't forget to like And subscribe I do have a lot of stuff coming out for you soon and I'm always taking topic recommendations so if you want me to address

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and number two for working with us on this video as well as helping make this rosacea education and information possible but remember this is not medical information that's for your doctor to give you do remember to reapply your spf especially if you have rosacea and always remember to be youtiful both inside and out i love you beautiful butterflies and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye you",

        "published_at": "2023-04-22T14:00:35Z",
        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "hello to say it's been a hot minute is a drastic understatement but what I'm glad to report is that my skin is clear my rosacea people say it's incurable I don't care I never believed it I never wanted to believe it so I kept searching for me it's been since 2016 and it's now 2023. it's about time I would say and in this video I want to share with you uh the things that have really helped me have changed and revolutionized my skin I spent a long time believing that it was difficult to heal and that the more pain I put myself through the stretch of the regimen the more likely it was that I was doing the right thing and that I would get better that was never the case and I've had times where I feel like I've healed and then I've backtracked I got mold poisoning and everything came back even with a Vengeance I became you know having reactions to all types of food when I had made so much progress before and I just thought when is enough enough and it was actually last year in August when I got I was before August it was in June last year when I got covered and I got significantly worse again everything got re-triggered and activated and I was just fed up and you know in those moments where you go nut enough is enough what I'm doing is not working it has gotten me this far it's not getting me any further and you hit this like roadblock and it's so frustrating and you just want to cry and you're overwhelmed I hit that point back in June 2022 and I turned around and went I'm doing it differently so I met this friend through my blog in the raw and I had helped her with her rosacea journey and she came back around and swung back around and helped me with my rosacea Journey now her recommendation to me was to try particular products this is not a sponsored ad I have nothing to do with anything I would never do that um but I'm just going to share with you what worked because I think I owe it to you and I've I've recommended it to multiple different people and the results that they've had has just been amazing uh because it works and all of a sudden what I found in my health Journey was that it went from being super difficult to being very clear this is getting rid of the cause I don't have to like starve myself and worry about everything being just so otherwise I'm going to have this awful reaction which is what it was all of a sudden I'm getting better and better and I can eat I was so happy and it was such a relief because every day my skin is getting consistently better consistently better consistently better and it's just like for the first time it's not get a bit better get a little bit worse get a bit better get a little bit worse and just like this journey of just uncertainty and like is it this is it that enough you know we have to deal with enough things that we shouldn't be having to worry you know constantly about what we eat about changing our pillow every five minutes about worrying about touching our face and just all these like finicky things that we we obsess over when we have such severe issues we think oh if we do all these miniature things like then my skin will be okay as if it's your fault that your skin is not okay that you are doing something fundamentally wrong well sometimes it's about finding the root of how it occurred and allowing yourself to enjoy life and ease into the things that you want to ease into um so this is what these products did for me and oh I should probably show you what they are I didn't organize that very well this is a bit impromptu so the products that I started using were recommended by my friend who also had a severe formal rosacea very similar presentation to mine we have very different Journeys but very similar presentation and I was super skeptical at first I was I it actually she recommended to me nine months earlier and I kept thinking to myself I wish I tried this earlier uh but who cares it was perfect timing that's just the same it was perfect timing so I tie the products I but before I did I start going no like I just nosedive into all of this person's content he was originally a doctor dermatologist who got sick of the fact that the typical way that Dermatology functions the options are laser antibiotics or anti-inflammatories all of which can cause a lot of damage and for many of you I know because I speak to so many people around the world their rosacea got significantly worse after taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatories because it exacerbates the underlying cause now controversial thing to say but I'm going to say it so he started questioning that and started formulating uh and researching to what might work and rosacea is such a complex skin condition it seems to be one of the most difficult skin conditions and the one that doctors seem to believe cannot be eradicated cannot be reversed but I have reversed the vast majority of my allergies before I get to the solution I just want to share with you something so exciting for the past three weeks I have been eating gluten I've been eating all these things that I normally would be like I'm never eating that again it's so bad for you um and just enjoying food and just loving life um so uh and I still listen to my body anyway the point is let's get to the product so I started using and researching and deep diving into a product called as osmosis or a brand called osmosis I began with their rescue serum uh which helped with my dry painful red and flaky skin it was so painful and so red I'll show you before and afters um I mean you can see the after but the befores of when I start before I started using these products it's just crazy like the inflammation not just the redness and the bumps I had like a nose bump like this but also the puffiness of my eyes the swelling of my cheeks like I also had like a double chin um even though I'm the same size so I was just overall really inflamed and swollen and that's because it's autoimmune issues now I thought on the rescue and immediately I felt insane relief like previously I had been putting on so much Derma vigils like just slapping on the lipids just to try and almost like a Vaseline just like trying to cover my um my barrier so that it would not be leaking moisture all the time because it was so itchy and so sore I was applying it multiple times a day I couldn't go anywhere without it I would never ever dream of you know not cleansing my face or going through my routine if I woke up I immediately had to go to the bathroom and wash my face because I was in agony always when I wake up when I go to bed now sometimes I forget to wash my face I actually don't know who I am anymore I'm pretty good though like it's it's not a regular occurrence but that's the level I don't it it's not like an everyday Obsession because it's not painful it's it's livable I mean it's pretty good so okay rescue fantastic product it's a DNA Repair Serum it helps to heal scars does all these things for collagen look it up um I'll probably put some links below uh so that you can have a little bit of a look-see but Dr Ben Johnson has so much so many YouTube videos online I'll tell you all the other things that I also used as well so I started with rescue and I also started with regenerate which was a liver it's meant to help regenerate the liver and help the liver so Dr Ben's theory is that with rosacea it's either liver induced or it's candida introduced and he has things on the website to determine what that is you can also email him uh and I'll put his email down below you can email him personally and he will respond to you um for free so that's really generous um it's getting harder and harder for him to do it within you know a week or so but it's worth it regenerate he told me I needed to go on it for nine months I hit the nine month Mark I think a month ago um and now I'm off all the internal products and my skin stays consistently really good it's improving all the time every month and so regenerate was the second one I also after I started doing the regenerate I was making a lot of progress but I wasn't making it's like I was making progress in some areas of my skin and not in other areas and when I sent some photos to Dr Ben he said you also have candida rosacea so I went on his candida protocol as well as the liver protocol and I started as I was detoxing my skin that's why I started with the rescue because it helps detox as well detox and heal after I started with the rescue I started adding other elements into my regimen but if it was causing the detox to happen too strongly I would pair back and wait I think it took me three months before I could go on some of these other repair serums I went on stem factor which helps with like collagen and scarring and then I also wanted to try Catalyst Ace 11. once you start learning about all these incredible products and what they do for your skin it's like I want to try I want to try but you have to slow down and so I now have implemented I've got stem Factor rescue the um correct serum I started off with calm which is better for rosacea skin you start off with calm and then uh Catalyst ac11 every now and again um and that's really good for elasticity and it's just all of it helps with different things for the skin especially when you're doing repair like I've had almost what seven years of skin damage and breakage to make up for so my skin is loving it the first thing I realized when I put this topical stuff on my skin was oh it's fading my skin my my skin feels fed uh so that was really great and then um yeah so you can look up what his candida protocol is it's um something called uh you take these capsules called clarify it helps you clear out mucus which apparently is what candida different types of candida feeds off and then you take this like spray Elixir thing which helps reduce the population of the candida so I did that for three months and noticed significant effects and then I just continued to improve as I continue to take regenerate and I also took his fat supplement which I forget the name of at this point in time uh that one's really amazing as well I took that for three months because I in the past had really bad I just I just didn't have enough natural oils and lipids in my skin um that's also something that could help aid your skin as well as not having enough oils because I wasn't absorbing it because my liver wasn't functioning properly so I wasn't absorbing fat and I've noticed like I used to have a lot of pulling like my skin was pulling and tight because it didn't have enough lipids and fats and I've done you know a lot of skin scans now and the pulling is no longer there so my skin is now like having this vibrant lipid look the youthful look or whatever I know I'm younger whatever I did have like all these what appeared to be like all these Fine Lines because my skin was so dry I would highly recommend giving it a go emailing Dr Ben again this isn't sponsored but I just wanted to give you guys an update because I want more people to know about what works and at the end of the day it's all about having a better relationship with your body learning to love yourself more and living the most vibrant life you can so you can start giving to others one of the things that I struggle with the most and I think we do struggle with in self-esteem when your skin severely affects your life especially with more severe skin conditions or ones that are autoimmune related they really significantly can impact your life and it impacts your ability to contribute to the world to actualize yourself to Greater to Greater degrees it might affect travel it might affect the activities you participate in it may affect the you know the confidence level of you to be able to make contacts and friends and further yourself and your career it might reduce your ability to earn and therefore give back to society maybe you want to make more contributions to Charities causes all these things like it affects every area of your life and people don't realize the significant impact and so that's why I'm sharing this with you because I feel like the past nine months of my life 10 months I think it's 10 or 11 months now I can't even count anymore I've just lost track have been transformed because of this so let me know how you go let me know your thoughts let me know if you've tried it before and yeah I would love to see how it helps you and if you tried it as a result of watching this video

        "transcript": "knock knock hi guys I'm Dr Abby Waldman I'm a dermatologist at Harvard Medical School in Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston Massachusetts and today I'm talking about five natural rosacea treatments so what does natural mean really by natural I mean non-traditional so there are so many great treatments that dermatologists or Physicians can offer for rosacea and those can include topical antibiotics topical Ivermectin that can affect mites it can be oral antibiotics and can even be Accutane but there are lots of non-traditional treatments that work really well and some of these are lifestyle based meaning changing your diet changing things that you're coming into contact with your skin care routine and other treatments and if you've seen my other video on rosacea you'll know that I personally have rosacea in addition to being a dermatologist that treats rosacea and so I am a huge proponent of those traditional treatments as well but especially in the last month or two I've started really looking at other things so I do get PDL which is a type of pulse die laser I have even gotten oral antibiotics in the past um for really short periods of time that have helped quite a bit but I started recently really looking to see if there were any sort of more holistic or natural treatments that I could do that would help my flushing so here's a picture from two months ago and again this is just a n of one this is a random morning before I put makeup on but you can see how bad my flushing can get and that in the last month or two since incorporating some of these things in my routine that morning flushing sort of what I wake up with has drastically reduced now of course again I'm one person I did made a bunch of changes at once which is so unscientific right you really want to make one change and then sort of follow out and see what's due to one thing but pretty much I made a bunch of changes at once um related to diet related to things that I was putting on my skin and so it's really hard to say which one in particular made the most significant difference but definitely you know this was picture is from this morning and again you just have to trust me that this picture represents other mornings because otherwise you can be like well how do I know you didn't wake up super red three days ago and you don't but that this is pretty much how I've been waking up for the last month since I made some of these changes so the first thing that I did was I started using LED light full disclosure it was gifted to me this mask so I started using it actually more for the anti-aging effects and the pro collagen effects well one benefit is that I started to notice that my rosacea was improving my redness was improving and there there is pretty good data for that and so a lot of the data is more in acne but there's some suggestion that blue light can decrease bacteria on the skin and that red light can suppress a lot of the growth factors and inflammatory markers that can lead to the signs of rosacea so basically I try to do this every night but I don't do it every night okay I do this honestly as often as I meditate because I will put this on at night it really freaks my husband out it's this crazy mask my daughter actually saw it for the first time because she couldn't fall asleep and I saw I had it on and she came in and she's like Mom what is that on your face she doesn't sound like that but by the way so this is it on it has this red light and so I will actually like lie there and meditate using this app and I do that anyway again not every night I do it at maybe maybe five nights a week if I am like super good and on it but more it's like two to three times a week so I'll put this on it lasts about 10 minutes which is about how long the app uh does the meditation and turn it off now just so that but you can see it has this little on off it turns off automatically at 10 minutes and again even though this is gifted this is not sponsored so even just doing that a few times a week I really did notice like almost immediately I would see a reduction in the inflammation and redness so it was enough for me to like actually keep doing it almost more than for the anti-aging effects but that will be like an added bonus too I guess and so you know again I really think a lot more research is needed in this certainly there's a lot of research to suggest that light in general can help rosacea most of that has been in laser so you ask yourself what is the difference between LED so LED is light emitting diodes and the difference between light emitting diodes and Laser is that light emitting diodes are in the visible spectrum meaning they will emit a wavelength that is in the spectrum that you can see basically a visible light but more specifically around one color of light for instance this one has red light right so that is 630 nanometers to 700 nanometers and that wavelength can actually get through not just the top epidermal part of the skin but even into the dermis which is where the blood vessels are and the fibroblasts that make collagen those are all in that layer and so the red light can penetrate that deep the difference between let's say this red light diode and a laser such as like a pulse dilator is that a laser is emitting just one wavelength and those photons in that wavelength are are going all together so you get something that's like a beam where all of them are going the same speed all those photons the same speed and at the same rate and they're all kind of going together and so you get like a punch whereas the led the light emitting diode is emitting usually kind of a little more of a range of the color so like red obviously there's like a little range of red even like in you know trying to find some red things here I can't find any even across like there's different slightly different shades of red and those can kind of go across that 630 to 700 nanometers all kind of showing up it's a slightly different color run the other thing is that they are not all in that column all the photons are not going at the same speed they're not going at the same rate so they're kind of just like coming at you right it's like having tennis balls kind of throwing all across the room versus them all coming out of like one big gun all at once so that's really the difference between being a laser and these led so for that reason LED is much safer right you're not going to accidentally like get it in your eye because again you're just kind of getting like one Photon here and there whereas a laser is so like that's why they say it's like a laser right it's on point so you like if you get all that energy directed at your eye that can become problematic if you have like a deeper laser like let's say an ND yag or maybe one that just targets the top layer of the skin that targets the water like a CO2 laser and you you can get into trouble with that right because it's like having a gun you're like boom and it can really affect the epidermis whereas the LED it's much harder to get into trouble with it but it probably has less of effect as well so anyway I think a lot more research is needed that being said I've been impressed with the result thus far um to continue so take that so moving on to skin care so one natural way to cover up redness is to just use the color wheel so the opposite of red on the color wheel is green I think Christmas green and red so there are lots of different products out there the one I'm using right now is the Jane Iredale color correcting serum and you put on just a few pumps so this is my skin without any makeup foreign [Music] so then it can just provide like a little bit of hiding and blending the redness underneath your makeup another one I've used is this green primer by Maybelline which they sell just at the at CBS and Walgreens and certainly in the comments post other green makeups or green serums that you find kind of take the edge off the redness so over that I put on azelic acid which I have done for a very long time mix that with a moisturizer that is fragrance free so again A lot of times the best natural things you can do is not what you can add but what you can take away from your skincare and so going fragrance free both in your moisturizers and skin care as well as much overlooked but what you wash your clothes with so detergent should be fragrance free you shouldn't add any fragrance to your wash because you're sleeping on that all night long so dryer sheets are a huge culprit use the dryer balls instead the rollerballs and that'll pick up some lint and it won't add any fragrance to your clothes so I use this moisturizer by Ruddy it's made for patients with rosacea because it has no fragrance and it has a few other things that help with redness I just mix those together put it all over to another holistic way to address redness with rosacea and to prevent flares is sunscreen every day I know you're so sick of hearing me say that the main thing I hear from people who have rosacea is it is really hard to find a sunscreen that doesn't make their face break out so again the key things are you want to find fragrance free when you look at the ingredients list fragrance cannot begin on there not even at the very last thing the other thing most people do find that a mineral sunscreen Works a little bit better at not breaking out their skin or not causing flares that's not the case for everyone I love a tinted product because it blocks some of the visible light as well as Smooths over the redness and kind of hides it and then the other thing you want to look for but is not required are antioxidants antioxidants can help minimize the redness I tend to put on a vitamin C serum which is antioxidant in the morning that being said I always find it's an added bonus if your sunscreen includes antioxidants such as Vitamin C niacinamide coenzyme Q all of these can help reduce inflammation and redness which is a big issue with rosacea my product of choice currently what I'm using is La Roche passe tinted mineral 50 SPF again you just want to find a product that you are going to use every single day whether it's raining or it's cloudy out you want to use it every single day so you do have to find a product you like because this is a long-term commitment you want to put two fingers worth a first finger and middle finger that is enough for your face neck and ears [Music] foreign so you can see now these are all natural holistic things that I did just with my skincare to already reduce a lot of the redness and irregularities related to rosacea a little green color correcting serum a fragrance free moisturizer with some azelic acid and then a tinted mineral sunscreen no makeup on then my last tip for your all-natural skincare routine for rosacea is again not what you're adding but what you're taking away and again just like fragrance this last tip actually has to do with what you're taking away what you're not doing and that tip is to not put Vaseline or any other occlusive moisturizer over active ingredients and by active ingredients I mean your retinol other prescription retinoids your aha BHA your exfoliant your glycolic acid all of those basically what the Vaseline does is it kind of traps the moisture and the heat in and it also really makes those ingredients work extra extra hard and if you have rosacea that's just gonna probably be too much for your skin I love slugging to be honest I think like in the winter it is the best it's just like I like weirdly love putting Vaseline on my face especially at night right before I'm going to bed but that being said it just doesn't work for your skin with the rosacea if you have an active ingredient on underneath that so I'm not saying Vaseline is bad I'm not saying aquifer are bad I think they're awesome for wound healing and for skin moisturizing and all of those things but it's an ingredient you want to avoid if you have rosacea sensitive skin and you're using an active ingredient so so far we've gone over our natural skin care tips for rosacea including a tinted mineral sunscreen with antioxidants if possible what you need to avoid in your skin care which is fragrance and slugging and then third is using that color wheel that green Spectrum to really minimize the redness that you have so moving on to diet and nutrition there has been a lot of research recently showing that rosacea can be correlated to your gut essentially can be correlated to gluten sensitivities or to Crohn's disease or also colitis bacterial overgrowth and it's been long known that there are many different foods that can trigger rosacea the most common being alcohol caffeine which there's no amount of money you could give me to cut out caffeine I don't care if that was like the number one thing causing murder rosacea I'd probably still have two cups of coffee a day luckily I don't think caffeine really is triggering mine but I'm not willing to really try it spicy food is a common culprit and then other ones that I hear a lot are sugar some people find Dairy is a big trigger for their rosacea so one change that I made in the last month that I do think actually made a big difference was cut out a lot of high processed sugar I eat gluten free anyway because I have Celiac I don't tend to ingest a whole lot of dairy but I was curious to see if I could cut out some of the added sugar to my diet so that would include desserts and ketchup and jams and things that have added sugar and I do think it made a difference I'm certainly gonna still eat ice cream on my daughter's birthday um you know I'm not being too intense and hardcore about it but I think just really there's a lot of data more and more coming out that this Mediterranean diet like we're eating Whole Foods mostly vegetables a lot of fish minimal processed foods limiting sugar really really can help your health in a whole lot of ways including minimizing rosacea so that's one change that I've made but again everyone's different and so you may kind of play around cutting out something for maybe about two to three weeks to see if it makes any difference and then adding it back in if that's not the case again main foods are caffeine alcohol spicy food Dairy gluten sugar and please put in the comments if there's been some other food group or something that's really really helped your rosacea by minimizing that and so then going back to the Mediterranean diet another change that I have found been helpful has been adding on omega-3 fatty acid supplement I do tend to eat a lot of fish but that really depends on the season we actually get like a fish share where we get to pick up some fish from Gloucester my hometown which is in Massachusetts that increase the amount of omega-3 fatty acids but in general you can get your omega-3 fatty acids from food and it's not just wild caught fish but can include seeds and nuts cod liver oil is very high in omega-3 fatty acids flaxseed chia seed walnuts and certainly some vegetables eggs and meats can also have lower levels of Omega-3 that being said I still was interested in adding a high quality wild fish based fish oil and a thousand milligrams to 1200 milligrams a day is recommended overall for omega-3 fatty acids to help skin most of the research in this has been in related to acne because it has been shown to significantly improve acne that being said there are suggestions that it will also reduce inflammation related to rosacea and generally it's just good for skin nails hair and overall health some other natural and holistic remedies for rosacea that I personally don't use a whole lot but can be useful to people or simple things like using ice when you come back from a hot day and you're rosaceous flaring or sitting in front of a fan actually can reduce your redness and flushing quite a bit rose hip oil is one I hear a lot about there's a lot of talk about tea tree oil which I think can probably be too irritating if you have rosacea but rosehip oil applied when you are having a flare a lot of patients I know with rosacea swear by this and so I have not personally tried it as of yet you have tried it please write in the comments and tell us all about your experience with rosehip oil so hopefully this was helpful for you I'm Dr Abby Waldman be well",

journey i'm going to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 skin condition which i have been suffering from\u00a0\nlast 15 years which is called rojasia i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to divide this video into different categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there lastly\u00a0\nbefore i go i want to say please be kind to others\u00a0\u00a0 be considerate to people who are suffering from\u00a0\nskin condition before you ask someone about their\u00a0\u00a0 face please think how you would feel if you were\u00a0\nin their shoes i feel like social media is also\u00a0\u00a0 to blame so we are conditioned to think everybody\u00a0\nneeds to have a beautiful skin you always see\u00a0\u00a0 like edited pictures flawless skin clear skin\u00a0\nin real life we have pores we have breakouts\u00a0\u00a0 we have pigmentation nobody has that porcelain\u00a0\nskin or baby like skin still today even though\u00a0\u00a0 i have a clear skin i don't have like a perfect\u00a0\nskin i feel like it is so important to normalize\u00a0\u00a0 skin conditions we need to have open dialogue\u00a0\nand open conversation in social media that is\u00a0\u00a0 how i feel anybody suffering with skin\u00a0\ncondition acne pigmentation or any sort\u00a0\u00a0 of skin condition please be kind to yourself\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching this video once\u00a0\u00a0 again and i hope you found this video helpful\u00a0\nand i'll see you guys on my next video if you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't subscribed please do i love to have\u00a0\nyou on my channel till then take care bye guys",

        "transcript": "hi this is dr carmelli and today we're going to talk about the broken blood vessels that are on the nose and on the cheeks that is a component of rosacea rosacea comes in different flavors as we say and one of them is just these broken blood vessels that appears on the face it can also be on the chest and neck but most people have a few that are right on top of their nose and it can really show up in pictures or when people try to cover it with makeup it's really hard to cover there is actually a laser treatment that we can provide called the v-beam laser where you can actually target selectively the blood vessels and deliver the right amount of energy to be able to get these blood vessels to be reabsorbed by the body because of the intense amount of light that they absorb this laser was actually developed for children with port wine stains so it's quite safe even in use for children and anything that's red is a great target for our laser so i'm going to show you how quickly and effectively we can treat these now the most common side effect that we can see from that is that some people can get mild bruising that can last a few days but there's no cuts to the skin and it's pretty painless actually and with any laser it's so important that after the treatment you stay away from the light sun and to protect your face using good spf and just avoiding the sun for at least a week until the area has completely been healed over so i'm going to show you now what we're going to do so here we go with the treatment there's a little sound and it's a little jolting because you see this light there's a sound and a little bit of a cold spray to help make this more tolerable so most people get jolted not because of the paint but just because it has a little bit of a sound and light associated so we're now just done with the treatment and the little vessels are actually gone pretty instantaneously as you can see they're all gone and we actually have no bruising so she's ready to go home we're going to put some sunscreen on it and should be ready to go no more blood vessels you",

        "published_at": "2015-07-24T23:08:40Z",
        "transcript": "Rosacea is a very interesting condition. It essentially has no pathology\nor described ideology, or that means a pathological process that is well defined with the source and a cause that causes it. So rosacea is essentially\nan entire spectrum of different symptoms\nfrom simple rosy cheeks to major fulminate oozing pustular rosacea and it can be very\nsevere, very debilitating, and of course not only is it a process of the skin destroying\nitself, but it's also can be a hotbed of bacterial infestation because of all the seeping and oozing. The traditional way of treating rosacea by the average physician\nor dermatologist is to use creams on the\nface, usually steroids, that simply suppress inflammation. So they will suppress the rosacea symptoms but not deal with the underlying condition of the skin. So there are two things\nthat we need to do. One is to take care of\nthe vascularization at the surface so that\nthe rosacea looks much better and takes care of all the inflammation. But underneath that in the dermis, this is something that people\ndon't often talk about, the vascularization shouldn't be able to get up into the top\nlayers and to the epithelium. So just taking off or reducing or treating the top layers or all that redness and vascularization is not enough. We need to go down beneath that and strengthen the collagen matrix of the top layers of the dermis. Now lasers are very good at doing that and we have different types of lasers that do it in different\nways, stimulating different components of the physiological machinery of collagen production, and\nyou're gonna be seeing that in the laser rosacea procedure that's coming up. Dr. Pien is using more\nthan one kind of laser to get down underneath into the dermis and strengthen and regenerate\nand remodel new strong tight, lifted, toned collagen that will keep the vascularization in the\ndermis where it belongs and not allow it to get up where everybody can see it. Now as you can see from some of the before and after photographs, someone with severe rosacea can get it completely cleared up where their skin looks\ncompletely flesh tone and normal, and no broken capillaries or spider veins or massive redness or seeping or oozing, all of that is simply gone. And doing it the way we do it, by working both at the top layers and down deep in the\ndermis, this is truly a cure for rosacea that lasts for a very very long time. The rosacea may come back,\nbut it won't come back quickly as it didn't show up\noriginally quickly either. It took a long time for it to show up. So the question is can this be done in just one rosacea laser treatment? Well it depends on the\nseverity of the rosacea. In very light cases, one\nlaser rosacea treatment might be enough. In very severe cases,\nfirst there's a series of treatments that take\ncare of all the inflammation and the vascularization on the surface before we can get down underneath and take care of the collagen\nremodeling and strengthening. So for a severe case, it may take three to five laser rosacea treatments to\nreally clear this up. The results of course are\nto have natural looking, smooth looking, and feeling, it feels good to touch skin that's\nnot pustular and oozing, and it looks wonderful.",

        "transcript": "if you have ocular rosacea\u00a0\nor even just regular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 this video is for you. Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": "April is rosacea awareness a month and for those of you who know me in the channel you know that I've posted a lot about my struggles with rosacea some of the products that I've used to help overcome it and I say overcome it kind of loosely um I've come to terms with it I recognize what my triggers are I understand better how to maintain My Skin Barrier and most importantly focus on the treatments and medications that give me the best outcome for my skin I will say rosacea is definitely a marathon and not a Sprint as is most things with skin care there's rarely an overnight success or magic treatment that's gonna solve all your skin issues no matter what they are but certainly that's the case with rosacea at least that's been my experience while I have my rosacea pretty much under control I still have flare-ups I still have irritation I still kind of regress backwards so I just wanted to kind of sit back relax and do a little bit of an update video for you on how my rosacea my skin is doing now and what I attribute My Success to my skin in at its lowest point look like this but you can see now I specifically for today's video I'm not wearing any foundation BB cream CC cream I chose a tinted mineral sunscreen it's really new to me it was sent to me in PR it's naked Sunday's tinted mineral sunscreen I like the tinted mineral sunscreens of course because they offset the white cast overall my skin is just so much better than it was not to say that I don't still have flare-ups I do especially when I ignore my triggers which I know full well what they are red wine which sucks because I love red wine spicy foods also sucks I love spicy foods and my husband likes to cook spicy foods so yeah sometimes I have to suffer through the aftermath with my skin and the sun it's very hard to avoid the Sun but I do my best to mitigate that so I will wear a hat when I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time and I always always wear a daily sunscreen my view on sunscreen is honestly just find one you love and you use that speaking of setbacks recently I was traveling staying in a hotel room you know the air is different in the hotel room I was drinking red wine with dinner the climate was slightly different you can see on my face here how my rosacea flares and it's almost immediately so as much as I try to control my triggers and set the situation to be optimal for Success it still happens I'll tell you what I did in my story and hopefully you can just extrapolate from that something that may be useful for you of course you should be in consultation with a medical professional I'm not that I'm simply here to share with you my story and my experience so that hopefully it can arm you with some more information and help you along the way if nothing else to know you're not alone the Hallmarks on my rosacea is an impaired barrier Associated redness and flushing irritation inflammation and pimples back when it was at its worst this is what I did I stopped everything in my skincare routine basically put myself on a skincare diet I I went back to the very basics of cleansing and moisturizing my skin and when it comes to Cleansing just choose a cleanser that's very gentle and hydrating that's what worked for me I've used this Cetaphil Vana cream was one of my favorites uh this one by avino continues to be one of my favorites it's their common restore line and I wanted to call out this one this is the glucoside foaming cleanser and while this is a new launch from the ordinary I've been really enjoying this product for my skin my children have been using it too and they also have very sensitive skin it was tested on babies originally and it's just been a really lovely cleanser so back then when I was at my worst I wish I would have had something like this too I've also used cerave's hydrating cleanser it's really just about finding the one that works best for you within your price point I only cleanse my skin at night with a cleanser in the morning I use water only this is one of the ways I was able to keep my barrier intact the cleansing process just seemed to be too much for my skin if I was doing it morning and night so that was really a game changer for me for moisturizers I like to offer something that's rich in ceramides and that is a little bit occlusive to lock that moisture into the skin because one of the Hallmarks of rosacea is a damaged Skin Barrier it has trouble holding and retaining that moisture into the skin so if you can do that with your moisturizer you're ahead of the game so cerave's moisturizing lotion is a great one love regimen Labs cream this is their second iteration of this particular product they've actually improved the consistency and the applicability of this on the skin it's far less thick and more spreadable I'd say on the skin and this one's fabulous because it has ceramides as does the CeraVe one it's a higher price point for this but I just really love this brand for a gel type moisturizer going back to Aveeno this common restore line has just been really good for my skin I love this it's drugstore so it's readily accessible and great for my combination skin sometimes I don't want a thick Rich moisturizer this can be great in the morning and a thicker richer cream in the evening is sometimes what I opt for but another new launch from the ordinary they've improved or added to their natural moisturizing factors line and this one is their natural moisturizing factors plus phytoceramides so again just adding more ceramides into the formulation making this a really good moisturizer for rosacea in my opinion and also for those of you with dry skin when it comes to daily sunscreen my opinion just find one that works for you whether it's chemical mineral hybrid whatever it is tinted non-tinted cheap expensive if you're gonna put it on your face every day go with that one I'm being facetious because sometimes sunscreen can be irritating to some and you want to find the one that best suits your skin I've actually created a shop my which really lists the products that are my favorites by category those are affiliate links so you don't have to purchase through through those just look at what the products are and then you can Google and purchase on your own because otherwise I make a very small commission if you purchase from those links so if you want to great and thank you if you don't totally fine as well but the point is to be able to share with you what my favorites are by genre so I'll link my favorites below for my sunscreen category so you can take a look through there ask me specific questions in the comments if you have about any particular product all of the ones that are listed there are ones that have worked for my skin so I hope you find that helpful I did want to call it this product that came to me in PR this is by Dr jard it's your secret pair tiger grass Camp drops they're really neat and it's green looks kind of gross but if you know the color wheel green offsets or neutralizes red now this is an SPF 35 but I actually use this kind of more like makeup and then it's just giving me that additional sun protection so I apply whatever sunscreen I'm wearing wearing for the day and then I put a few drops of this over top and it really neutralizes the red so I'm kind of almost using it like makeup as opposed to sunscreen but definitely impressed with this product for me Beyond getting a basic skincare routine in place and focusing on restoring and repairing My Skin Barrier without adding in any active ingredients like retinoids and vitamin Cs and acids and all that stuff just keeping it to the basics I also needed medical intervention so at the time I was prescribed this which is metrogel this is an antibiotic gel often used for people who struggle with rosacea I can say that this was definitely responsible for getting my rosacea under control in that kind of acute flare-up phase that I was in once My Skin Barrier was intact and things were calmed down settled down that's when I could reintroduce the active ingredients into my skincare routine such as my vitamin C retinoids Etc so just because I have rosacea doesn't mean that I can't capitalize on those things it's just sometimes I have to opt for versions that are more sensitive skin friendly and when I have a flare-up I kind of revert back to the basics again just to be sure my Skin's under control before I reintroduce those active ingredients in my skincare routines the next thing and it's no surprise for those of you who have watched my channel for a while it's the thing that I actually attribute my kind of ongoing success with my rosacea is azelic acid I feel like it is really responsible for keeping my rosacea obey and maintaining My Skin Barrier overall I have used over-the-counter acelaic acid serums for years and I can say some of my favorites are Paula's Choice 10 azoleic acid booster and this one by theramid it's their acid or azid I'm not sure how it's pronounced but this one's at 15 azaleaic acid I was impressed with this one because it's actually the same percentage of azelic acid as my prescription and strength osoletic acid and I fairly recently started this prescription phenacea finessia tomato tomato I'm not sure but it's a 15 prescription only here in Canada as oleic acid now the different approach I've had with this one versus the other ones is that I was normally using those once a day generally in my morning skincare routine paired with my vitamin C but I've been using this one now for about six weeks twice a day morning and evening skincare routine it's another reason I love this as a product azelic acid it pairs well with so many other things it really doesn't have conflicts you don't have to worry about it I use it in my evening skincare routine paired with my retinoid in my morning skincare routine pair with my vitamin C the only thing I don't do is I don't put it in the same routine as my acid day when I use my aha or Alpha hydroxy acid it's once a week and I just focus on the acid and hydrating skin care products to surround that routine I'm only six weeks into this sort of regime so I will definitely do an update for you later on but already I am reaping the benefits of this overall I can feel that my skin is just more calm and healthy azelic acid has so many health benefits for the skin especially for rosacea it works to decrease the swelling the associated redness but is really effective at targeting the bacteria that's in the pores that can also contribute to the pimples associated with rosacea making this also a great product or great ingredient for those of you with acne prone skin of course there can be Associated side effects I think primarily those are tingling stinging and even drawing of the skin I personally haven't had that experience so I'd love to hear from those of you who perhaps have had that experience you can share that in the comments section below but certainly if you're using a prescription nasolic acid you'd be in consultation with a medical professional and of course they'd be able to talk to you more about that but if you're using OTC or over-the-counter azoleic acids just be aware you're experiencing that as well I will continue to monitor my rosacea with you and I'll do more updates as we go along and just see how my journey goes because I'm hoping it's helping you to understand more about the disease and spreading awareness which is what the April rosacea awareness month is all about I'll drop some information on that in particular below I would really really love it if you would share your thoughts experiences comments in the comments section below if you haven't watched them already be sure to watch these videos up on screen and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "Hi, this is Dr. Kormeili    and today we're going to\u00a0talk about the broken blood vessels that are on\u00a0the nose and on the cheeks  that is the component\u00a0of Rosacea   Rosacea comes in different flavors as we say \u00a0\u00a0 and one of them is just these broken blood\u00a0\nvessels that appear on the face  it can also be on the chest and neck\u00a0\u00a0  but most people have a\u00a0\nfew that are right on top of their nose and it\u00a0can really show up in pictures  or when people\u00a0try to cover it with makeup  it's really hard\u00a0to cover.  \u00a0 There is actually a laser treatment\u00a0 that we can provide called the V beam laser\u00a0\u00a0 where you can actually target selectively  the\u00a0blood vessels and deliver the right amount of\u00a0energy to be able to get these blood vessels\u00a0 to be reabsorbed by the body  because of the\u00a0intense amount of light that they absorb \u00a0 This\u00a0laser was actually developed for children with\u00a0\u00a0 port-wine stains so it's quite \u00a0 safe even in use\u00a0for children  and anything that's red is a great\u00a0target for our laser  So I'm going to show you how\u00a0\nquickly and effectively  we can treat these now.\u00a0\u00a0 The most common side effect  that we can see from\u00a0that is  that some people can get wild bruising,  that can last a few days,\u00a0\u00a0  but there are no cuts to\u00a0the skin \u00a0 and it's pretty painless actually\u00a0 And with any laser,  it's so important  that after\u00a0the treatment you stay away from the light\u00a0\u00a0 Sun and to protect your face using good SPF  and\u00a0just avoiding the Sun for at least a week\u00a0\u00a0 until the area has completely been healed over  so I'm\u00a0going to show you now what we're going to do. So here we go with the treatment, there is a little zap A little jolting because you see this light\u00a0 there's sound and a little bit of a cold\u00a0spray\u00a0 to help make this more tolerable\u00a0  so\u00a0most people do get jolted \u00a0 not because of the pain  just because it has a little\u00a0\nbit of a sound and light Association So we're now just done with the treatment and the little vessels are actually gone pretty instantaneously \u00a0\u00a0 see they're all\u00a0gone and we actually have no bruising\u00a0\u00a0 go home we're going to put some\u00a0\nsunscreen on and she'll be ready to go home  no more blood vessels",

        "transcript": "i have rosacea and one of my biggest concerns is facial redness over the years i have tried using oral and topical medicine but the redness will still show up another concern that i have is pigmentation on my face especially on the cheeks and on the nose after speaking to dr trump about my concerns a yellow laser treatment seem to be the best treatment i can do as it effectively treats rosacea as well as pigmentation rosacea is actually a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that vexes and veins comes and goes and has many different triggers to it there are actually four different types of rosacea most commonly type 1 and type 2 rosacea is manifested by central phase readiness as well as many small breakouts that might be mistaken for acne or pimples rosacea that's actually still not very well understood it's under the there's some genetic links to the disease it's also more prevalent in those who are more fair skinned there are certain triggers lysine that can bring on the condition rosacea is manifested by aberrant blood vessels on the surface emits a laser beam at the 577 wavelength that is very well absorbed by blood it actually coagulates the blood vessels closes them up and then helps at the root of the problem by removing the blood vessels so hence patients normally see a session by session improvement of their condition when the patients first come in for a consultation usually they are very unsure of what they want or what they need and in a consultation apart from analyzing their skin condition it's also important to analyze their skin type the reason why we use uh various modalities to treat skin is really because of these two factors condition and type different types of conditions need different lasers and different types of skin are more suitable for certain treatments rather than others and after analyzing these factors then we i then go ahead to explain to them as simply as possible what the possible strategies there might be to manage the particular skin condition being one of the only lasers that also help with an anti-inflammatory effect increasing the population of people who have a sensitive skin and a sensitive skin problems we find that is being more and more commonly recommended in the treatment regime of every patient the heat generated from the laser felt like quick needle like pulses though it can feel a bit prickly the treatment is really bearable and there is actually no pain at all the laser is really comfortable and what i love most is that there is no downtime at all after a few sessions my facial awareness have improved tremendously and it is now kept under control yellow laser has also helped to improve the pigmentation on on my face especially the nose and the cheek area revealing a clearer and brighter complexion",

Amer how are you were in West Hollywood and one of my beautiful long-term change was about the ceiling but it's annoying condition that everybody knows up in the rosacea were different flushing and some residents on her skin that really starts to bother her we've been to being aggressive with getting treatment done to blue first skin that we're doing right now what's called a full side laser treatment or jeebies now this laser has been tried as true laser but remain a gold standard treatment for rosacea for many many years because as you can see it's literally targeting the blood vessels and even though rosacea can come and go we need to stretch those blood vessels to keep their symptoms of beige if she doesn't get a long-term dilated blood vessels or painting in these areas so we're really focusing on all her problem areas of where the rotations now in well recent tasks we figured out that the recent history church the right a little bit we have figured out there's her on this side we figured out that combining this but not ablative lasers light ones like clear brilliant or superficial radiofrequency nano fractional RF such as the Venus b1 has very useful for people that have long-term redness on the skin because inflammation goes down when these energies it's a little shocking for not a disturbance of liquors trips yeah but we're focusing on all the areas she has redness and cleaning on the beard all this out doing her noise what's the lessor cold again this one's called a beam and you guys could see to look over there there's the bezel prima which is the newest TVs that were using on the market for rosacea rosacea one of the teams that is that you have symptoms and there's all different types of rosacea vitamist rosacea when people have a very large family the notices and big big it's skin we try and avoid that from occurring by using this later lasers earlier on and when people notice it but there's also athletes back we spend rosacea where people have questionable we call PCP or cocktail partially rosacea which looks like acne so it's really important if you do have redness and bumps you come in and get that tree because sometimes that needs a key change or for very aggressive speech but this type of education which is bump the key teach pocket or arredondo totally note attic type this is where we focus on really true the implications what's that smoke that are dilated Tufts redness on the skin so I'm gonna show you guys switch the setting we focused on the diffuse areas commerce which the Senate really needs to treat the actual violated small blood vessels is this street man available in New York yes whenever I'm in New York we can do this treatment too there's also a newer laser that's a competitor called the excel beat that also can be used as well so now we're going to focus on treating some of her blood vessels or recalibrating the system and she's singing that her nose was really bothering her where these blood vessels are dilated let me show you guys you can see we look here do you see like right there there's a dilated blood vessel right over here and the corners of her nose over there top of the nose right here and actually a lot of them inferior that first treatment that first one asks no that's good we're gonna focus on this is cool I'll show you guys take a look looks like a UFO see it's like a UFO so I'm gonna test out my arm on two three balls perfect because this is in the shape of where the blood vessels are as a little a little wormy to eat that we can get those muscles turn a little to the right a little more targeted and it allows them because the energy is very focused and linear rather than a circular pattern small babies how how often would you suggest this treatment well here's the thing when you have a very severe inflator you need to do treatments every three to four three to six weeks for about two or three tires then we maintain at least every quarter is why we tell people if the unless it continues to flare but this should calm it down very very quickly but we haven't really actually done a full treatment probably since November so that's a very long time that's why it's a little more clear now and we're being a little more aggressive attina so they're targeting turn all the way back [Music] targeting some of the smaller vessels that she has and what would the dumb town look like well the Dow pepper miss isn't really much is just a little bit of redness today and then it slowly starts to fade over the next few days you guys with importance this isn't an ablative laser is a focused targeted vascular laser what that means is all you're going to see is redness but nothing on the surface that's in a harbor so that is the dhih beam treatment tuberose Asia we're going to go to the second component in a second",

going to i just don't feel confused a day today i feel so depressed [Music] my nose is changing shape day by day [Music] and the blood vessels i can feel them burst in pain is chronic [Music] it's like i've got no face left it's just all nose [Music] i just hate everything about myself at the moment [Music] hello i don't want me coming around because i've just been worried about you come in come in just recently i've met a really lovely group of friends oh i can't wait to hear what this is all about i think i'm going to lose those friends though because i'm making so many excuses it's really affecting my life and i've not told them why they must just think i'm being well she don't want to know anymore i don't feel very lazy like especially when they say more men get this oh right i just feel like a free can when she stopped coming out at all and really even stopped phoning i couldn't really work it out so it's quite a worry really hello i'm here to see dr emma i'm hoping today that dr emily is going to be able to tell me that she's going to be able to help me it would give me my life back it'd give me my confidence back i wouldn't feel so ugly and just please god she can hi is it trish yes hello come with me thank you come on in patricia thank you how are you um a bit depressed today as you can see the redness i feel like my nose is just growing and growing all over my face like a clown and how long have you had this problem for her i would say at least 11 years okay but just in the last 18 months it's this redness that's causing my nose to swell is it painful i'm getting blood vessels breaking and they kill you it just you the pain is excruciating i don't like the way i feel i'm usually i like to go out i like to meet my friends but i i don't want to do that at the moment yeah and it is it's it's really destroying me inside yeah i'm sorry it's having such a horrible impact on you it's just destroying my life i know we kind of need to fix that a little bit too it's more than just the skin on your face that we need to fix it's kind of how you're viewing yourself isn't it okay right well i'm gonna get a magnifying glass so i can get close in there and have a good look is that okay okay keep those eyes closed for me [Music] your nose is hard as a rock isn't it yeah but it feels a little bit more like a swelling and you've a beautiful sloop to the nose here but then i can see a little bit more bulk coming at this part and then we can see really clearly all of these lines of the vessels okay trish so this most definitely is uh rosacea and rosacea kind of manifests itself in different ways on the skin the main problem for you which is the rhinophyma which just means a thickening change of the nose and becoming redder in color and as well as the rhinophyma has changed you've also got the kind of papules and pustules on the cheeks it's almost a bit like a vicious cycle you've got the redness which is the inflammation and you've got the vessels and then that makes more vessels and more inflammation so it's it's just repeating itself now my treatment program for rosacea for your skin does involve you being quite diligent with it and you can pretty much do it in a couple of minutes and in the morning and a couple of minutes at night time nine you cannot deviate from this the skin treatment no okay no the next thing is is that the tablet themselves will start to gradually and slowly bring down the bulk and start to switch this process off and then reverse the process and then the last thing i need to do is use my lasers on you to get rid of the vessels and the background rareness which is the most satisfying thing that morty and i just we dream of doing this is just wonderful is that okay thank you so much trish you know she was so upset at how this was affecting her and what's really been happening is is the rosacea that she has has been becoming more out of control and she's now developed quite an obvious rhinophyma i'll get back to my life again yeah i know i want to get back to your life so first of all to try and calm the skin as much as possible i need to give her some cream to try and control things but creams are just not going to be enough to cut this and you need to have something by mouth and then i need to give her some laser treatment because the only way to get rid of the redness and the only way to get rid of the vessels is to use a pulsed dye laser [Music] now i've come out of a different person because i've got hope and i'm just over the moon it's just like a miracle [Music] i've now got my cream for my face so i first met trish and diagnosed her with rhinophyma which is a form of rosacea this is just to take um the redness down so she's been started on a medication to try and help regain the symmetry and make it a bit smaller one two three well done and then also i'm using some intense pulsed light to complement it that's the vessel wall just destroyed i just had two sessions of that [Music] so things are doing really well yeah that one's definitely dead at that side i'm a bit swollen at the moment where i've just had the procedure but um i'm gaining a lot more confidence um every day [Music] hi i'm here to see dr emma it's trish i'm really excited to show dr emma today because um it's been a few weeks now and she'll see the difference herself i can't wait for it to sit hi youtube hi nice to see you oh lovely to see you new dress new hair yes new dress new houses the catwalk more confident come on have a seat just up on the bed okay so first of all trish do you have any makeup on no makeup on at all i would have come out with that makeup on it's amazing it is it was mouth yeah it was it was most and the shape was really odd yeah and i just felt like i didn't want to go anywhere or do anything and now that modeness is gone yeah and i just i just feel like a different person let's have a little look wow you've actually got the shape of your nose back look at your cheeks that is just fantastic what i think is really most striking is the um profile of the news returned again whereas this was all bulky out at the side i i need to see for probably about another two or three laser treatments okay where i'm going to be completely happy with it you're using the right creams you've got the right medicines yes and then hopefully this is never going to come back and bother you again honestly you look brilliant it's absolutely brilliant i feel great [Music] you",

        "transcript": "hi everyone Samia was dr. Umar's office we're ending our night with some great treatments here we are going to be doing a combination of laser Genesis and clear brilliant so what we want to target is some of the redness of his skin he's a little bit red a little extra pink down here but this is from the numbing cream but he does have regularly is a little bit of this redness right here on the anterior portion of his cheeks this is very common for patients I'm going to turn you a tiny low back to have some broken blood vessels in here and you can kind of see they go away when you push on them essentially we're pushing the the blood out of these little blood vessels so these little broken capillaries they can be kind of around the nose on the cheeks a lot of times on the chin and sometimes they're bothersome to patients for women they can be hard to cover up so we can use vascular lasers to minimize the appearance and take those broken capillaries away from the surface of the skin to where they're not quite as visible so with this we start in one little area so I always start on the forehead for the patient this is very comfortable if he feels it it's gonna feel like warm water and we get started and what we do is we just go over this entire area and we're going to build up some heat in the skin and that heat is going to collapse or shrink those blood vessels that's going to in turn minimize the redness so we're gonna go full face this is something that's not going to have any downtime you may be a little bit pink right after the treatment because of the flushing that we induce in the skin after that goes away all you're left with is a real nice blow you've stimulated collagen and you can you know do this before a big event or just weekly it's something that's really great to control acne and then kind of slow down the aging process just bring out your healthiest cells can you repeat with those treatments cool this is laser Genesis it's a vascular laser it's very comfortable just great for all skin types with no downtime and whether your concern is anti-aging or redness or acne this treatment can really benefit you and it can be done on a weekly basis or a monthly basis depending on the severity of the condition and what the results is that you're looking to achieve how many treatments would you recommend one so with this treatment I always tell patients that when you're trying to correct an issue you're treating with more frequency than if you were just maintaining or preventing so if we were looking to relieve reduce or eliminate redness I would say hey come in weekly for the next four to eight weeks and let's really reduce that and after that you can come in every two weeks every four weeks and just space it out from that point but initially it would be a weekly treatment until we get to our desired goal and then we could start spacing it out a little bit more go ahead turn your head slightly perfect you might feel some little pops this would go over the hair follicles what else would you like to know any other questions what's up take your photos good question so as far as aftercare goes for laser Genesis it's really easy he can go back and resume his regular skincare when we incorporate the second part of his treatment which is clear brilliant then we start to take into consideration aftercare products that are going to soothe and heal some of the micro trauma that we've induced into the skin essentially with without getting low hot no problem we'll move over so with clear and brilliant what you are getting is kind of a micro fractional laser treatment and you want to work on soothing and repairing the cells that were causing to turn over go ahead and doing this way perfect so we incorporate growth factors we incorporate vitamin C's non hydroquinone brighteners dermal work dermal repair moisturizers that's pretty much it those are some of the mainstays of our treatments those are all the questions it's awesome well I'm gonna finish up here we're going to build up the temperature to about 44 degrees and once we've hit all those temperatures and that in all the different areas we're going to move on to the next treatment so stay tuned I'll see you back in the field",

        "transcript": "[Music] hi everyone my name is katarina marie and today i'm going to be talking about my ipl photo facial review so my skin's always been pretty red um it can be caused from like being too hot too cold running up the stairs too fast basically anything my face just gets really red especially like around my cheek area so it's quarantine time it's time for self improvement and i'm just over it i want to have like clear skin without waking up and having to put foundation on it so it looks like a normal color um i can kind of like tell because if i like compare my neck skin to my face skin my neck skin looks totally normal same with like my arm if i put it next to it i can kind of see my cheeks are just like unnaturally red so i did some research in real self ipl has pretty good reviews so i found a local place it's willing to let me film my experience and i'm pretty excited i hope my skin ends up being like at least a relatively normal color after this i'm not expecting it to be like perfectly the same as the rest of my body but at least if it could be a little less red because the ipl laser is supposed to work by targeting the tiny little veins in your skin and just causing them to like die essentially with my understanding of it so basically the laser is just gonna shrink all those little veins and once the little veins are gone should be also less redness especially because my skin's really thin so i feel like any little vein any little anything underneath my skin it just shows through immediately so if i can just get rid of them entirely hopefully my skin will be clear and a normal color okay i'm gonna try and get really close so you can actually see how red it is so if i hold up my arm with like normal color skin to my face you can see in comparison it's actually really red um the same within comparison to my neck pretty much it's just pretty much all over like all back here so i don't have anything on right now other than a little bit of eyebrow filler mascara and moisturizer on my face but i don't have anything on my actual facial skin so you can see it's like really red and yeah i'm just over it i want to just go to wake up put on mascara do my brows and then call it a day i don't want to have to like always have on at the minimum a layer of sheer foundation or something to feel comfortable going out so that's the dream fingers crossed ipl works hey oh [Applause] hi everyone i'm back again i did my first ibl treatment and i actually really like it um it's been about three weeks since i did it so i feel like my skin's had enough time to heal and like close off the veins and i can actually see a difference which i'm pretty surprised because i know you're supposed to do like multiple treatments i think a minimum of three ipl treatments to actually see a really significant difference but even after one i can already see it and like again like comparing my face to my neck obviously it's still a bit more red like it's not perfect but it's a lot better and i by no means had like severe rosacea but definitely still enough to kind of like have a noticeable difference in my everyday life so i'm really happy i did it in the end it wasn't too painful it actually hurt less than i thought because i was like really nervous going into it and she was like no don't worry it's not gonna hurt you don't even need numbing creams i'm like okay so yeah after the first like little zap i was like oh this is like nothing to be scared of um when i checked the reviews some people said it was like super painful they had numbing cream and it still hurts i'm not really sure why it wasn't that bad for me but maybe it's just like a different strength setting or something like that that's my guess but yeah so i especially on this side of my face had like a lot of those teeny little veins just from like squeezing my blackheads too hard or like genetics i'm not sure why they are there but ipl is also supposed to be good for getting rid of that um i think they're called spider veins so i had like a teeny bit of those around my nose and like one in my cheek somewhere and actually those are reduced too which i was surprised it's like not even the reason i went in but they're like definitely reduced and i know some people they go to get ipl like only for the purpose of getting rid of spider veins so that's like another cool thing that you can go for um pretty much i'm really happy with it i'm going to get closer so you can see it better but you can already tell like the difference between my neck or my arm to my face it's so much less red so i'm so happy and yeah so it's it's been gradually getting less and less red since i first did it three weeks ago and maybe it'll continue to get even better i'm not sure my skin's like still healing or not but yeah i can see such a big difference and i'll probably end up doing like a second treatment maybe another two months from now or so so yeah another thing i wanted to say is along with like not really having much pain during it i also didn't have a lot of things that like some people report after like some people say that where they have like freckles or like hyperpigmentation turned really really dark after ipl and then like disappeared i never had any of that i think they call it coffee grounds like because it looks like coffee grounds are on your skin i never experienced that but i also don't really have freckles anymore um and i don't really have any hyperpigmentation because i think my skin's just not really prone to it it's more prone to redness instead of like darkness so that never happened to me um but it's probably for the best because um basically like immediately after my face was definitely pretty red but i didn't even have peeling like i didn't really have any issues um i basically kind of just looked like normal like maybe even just three hours afterwards so yeah it was um easy breezy i definitely i recommend it um i'm gonna probably do it another time to give my like full review but at least this is part one and you can see that i'm very happy with it so far so yes ipl definitely recommended [Music] you",

        "published_at": "2017-12-11T16:02:20Z",
        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments
