        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

        "published_at": "2023-02-03T17:00:28Z",
        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

think you have it [Music] rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that a lot of people associate with redness on the face but it can actually present itself in many different ways so let's get into that a little bit more so there's four different things that I kind of talk about my patience with and people can have any variation of that first trigger-based flushing so hotter spicy food red wine changes of emotion changes of temperature I hate to use the word both hormonal flushing and the face gets a little bit pink in the cheeks and then the flushing goes back down second is textural changes on the skin so acne bumps enlarged pores dryness easily irritated any of those things where the texture of your skin is noticeably different may actually be a component of rosacea and what's interesting is you actually may see these textural changes which kind of look like pimples around your chin nose and eyes third you may see broken capillaries little tiny broken blood vessels in the skin that actually leave the skin looking a little bit pink and red and somebody may think for example you've been sunburned or have a little blush on when actually you don't and then lastly ocular rosacea or rosacea around the eye that leaves the eye watery feeling a little bit gritty like you want to dig something out of there each one of these components of rosacea has a nuance treatment that your dermatologist may talk to you about that being said anyone with rosacea really should consider using a very gentle skin care routine on a daily basis [Music] when I talk to patients about what they should be using on their face in the context of rosacea the first would start with a very gentle hydrating cleanser no harsh soaps nothing that's foaming nothing that's drying because what that's gonna do is it's just gonna stoke the fire creating more redness second when it comes to exfoliation I recommend using a beta hydroxy acid like salicylic acid instead of an alpha hydroxy acid like glycolic acid why because it's a little less irritating and also it can help minimize the enlarged pores which often come along with the textural changes of rosacea moisturization is essential because patients with rosacea may note that they have particularly dry skin so I recommend looking for creams and lotions that have components like ceramides glycerin and hyaluronic acid lastly and probably most importantly is sun protection and ultraviolet protection because we know that UV light and heat can be a very big trigger for rosacea flares so I recommend to my patients that they never leave the house before applying a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher if you're interested in collagen building or fading down fine lines here are some of the ingredients that I like the Cuchillo is a plant-based ingredient that's been used in many other parts of the world to bring out radiance and glow and increase collagen production and it's extremely gentle on the skin also I really like a vitamin a derivative called ret and aldehyde which helps to build collagen but is a lot less inflammatory than other retinoids [Music] so here are some of the things that I recommend avoiding when you're applying makeup I wouldn't use the harsh bristly brushes this is a great place for the makeup sponge to blend in your foundation or to put on your concealer because they're a lot less irritating to the skin and may not bring out that redness that can be triggered by irritation on the skin I also recommend avoiding mechanical cleansing brushes and mechanical exfoliants because they can actually make you have more broken capillaries on the skin so I would just steer clear of those altogether and then the last thing I would say is just be overall very careful of what you're putting on the skin it kind of takes some examination before you buy a product just because it says natural or organic or plant-based doesn't mean it's great for the skin and it actually may be pro-inflammatory [Music] so here are some specific product lines that I like for rosacea for sunscreen I like the elta MD line they have a wonderful product called Alta clear that you can put on each morning before you leave the house and as the clear and the name connotes it blends in easily with any skin routine but it also has this little magic gem of niacinamide in it that helps to reduce inflammation so that's one of my fan favorites when it comes to rosacea products I also like this line called a vent which is in general which is very gentle on the skin for those of you interested in collagen production and decreasing fine line this product here which is active ingredient is retinaldehyde is a gem just use a pea-sized amount over the entire face to get your desired result now one of the tips and tricks I tell my patients is actually just to apply it to the periphery of the face not the central face because the outside of your face is where you'll have the least amount of inflammation from rosacea but most of those pesky little lines another product line I love which is from Spain is called isdon't you can find it locally here in the US and this in particular this line in particular called mell atonic is infused with the coochie all that plant-based derivative that we talked about and it's very gentle I really love this because it's a serum base and I can and I like that it's clear as you can see and I like that I could use it in the morning or at night giving me a little bit more flexibility in my routine so I actually use this on a regular basis because I myself had of a smidge of rosacea that's trigger based for my feet so when I get out of the shower my face is a little flushed and I just put on my mellow tonic [Music] now that you have the general skincare routine for rosacea let's talk about the specific treatments that I may recommend to my patients so first for trigger-based flushing and I know this is SuperDuper annoying what I usually recommend to avoid the triggers the second component of rosacea that we talked about which is the textural changes or the acne bumps that may occur around the mouth the nose or the eyes eye there are a lot of options for this there could be topical or oral antibiotics that can come in the form of creams or pills and those can significantly help to reduce those irritated inflamed papules that occur and many times that is what causes the most anxiety in cases of patients who have rosacea third for the broken capillaries on the face thank God for lasers because they really help to reduce and get rid of those little teeny-weeny capillaries that are creating the red and pink hue to the cheeks and lastly ocular rosacea which actually can be the trickiest one to treat and can come on and off for years your dermatologist may give you an oral antibiotic to subside some of the inflammation or even recommend gentle cleansers to place along the eyelid to get rid of some aback grit so I hope from this episode that you learned that there are different components to rosacea but also a lot of different treatment options so definitely get in to your dermatologist and definitely check out some of the products we recommended today thank you so much for watching this episode of dear derm don't forget to subscribe to well and good and leave any comments below you",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds I'm Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to Pillow Talk durm where we meet every Saturday morning to expand your brain and mind in the process if you have no idea who I am subscribe so you know what's good for you but I am a board certified dermatologist and today we are going to be focusing on rosacea because it is the last weekend of rosacea awareness month and I've taken pity on you flushed red human beings out there so we're going to focus on how to better identify your rosacea and help yourself but before I do that make sure you head on over to d r ris.com because I am starting a new newsletter that's going out every week that is purely educational focused from Dr eris.com so we'll be recapping some of the YouTubes we'll be focusing on new topics if you guys have questions make sure to email us at hello.com and we will make sure to incorporate those questions into that newsletter every week so head on over there I will link it below on the screen so back to rosacea what is it what causes it how do you identify it we're going to get in right now rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition it is not acne and I have to start off by saying this because as a Derm I get so annoyed when I see the marketing around ingredients for rosacea as acne but I understand why they do this and I'm going to let you guys in on something take for example sulfur which we're going to talk about in this video in order to get a drug fact label on a sulfur product so you can have a quote unquote medical indication for that ingredient you have to abide by what the FDA sees that ingredient fit for sulfur has traditionally been approved by the FDA for acne so they often write for example on sulfur purpose acne treatment and that's huge for a brand that they can actually say that so they're going to go ahead and run with it but sulfur is traditionally great for rosacea and not necessarily acne so I think in the process the public has gotten confused and started confusing the two and treating rosacea like acne but that is probably the worst thing you can do because it can disrupt your Skin Barrier more and it can inflame your rosacea worse in the process but I wanted you guys to understand this very nuanced thing so that you know as a person that rosacea is truly not acne it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is due to a multitude of different things we actually don't know exactly why you get it we do believe there is a genetic predisposition when you think of Rosa you think of a white person who gets really red but do not assume that darker skin tones can't have rosacea either it is just harder to detect and see but they can absolutely have rosacea too and it's usually due to a multitude of different factors from genetics chronic heat UV exposure a broken Skin Barrier little tiny mites like these called Demodex mites that are just going rampid on your skin we all have them some of us have them a little bit more than others and when they wake up and they're alive they tend to just mess up but deodex mites an overabundance of reactivity in terms of flushing etc etc etc and when you have a little bit of everything The Perfect Storm can show up on your face when you're nervous when you're stressed when you're hot when you're eating spicy foods when you're on a date you name it but there are really if you want to take a step back four main types of rosacea starting with the most common emodal ectatic rosacea Arial means red tantic means blood vessels rosesa is rosesa so when you have somebody who's red with a lot of broken blood vessels all over their face they have one of the most common forms known as the athematic type then you have the one that I think people get confused by that they confuse with adult acne papulo pular rosacea papules and P little red bumps and little tiny bumps all over your face usually along the cheeks the nose maybe a little bit here can sometimes happen along the chin interesting tip and this one's a good one you do not have blackheads in rosacea and with rosacea the nasal labial folds this area is spared so if you're having all of a sudden a breakout right here around your mouth it's probably not rosacea if it affects your nasal laal folds then you have the the third type which is like your old white uncle that you just can't or maybe you love or you just don't really like I don't know maybe I'm projecting but you have Fus rosacea where when you have chronic inflammation right and enlarged sweat glands the skin can appear thicker and your pores can look enlarged and your nose starts to get really distended and honestly deformed over time it can happen to your nose it can happen to your chin it can happen to your forehead that's the Fus type then the fourth type is ocular rosacea which people often Overlook completely but the eyes are usually affected in 50% of rosacea sufferers and what do you get with that you get blefaritis so inflammation along the eyelid margins you can get redness of the white part of your eye you have to take an eye hygiene into consideration but also when your eyes are affected and they're chronically inflamed especially the lid margins you want to calm that inflammation down so you don't f up your eyeballs in the process and have scratches on your corneil so that's usually an oral medication and that's why you shouldn't be scared of going on systemic medications but you should probably also see an opthalmologist and let them know about it so how can you then help yourself first without going into any sort of over-the-counter products or even prescription medications or in office treatments there's lifestyle and the things associated with lifestyle you're not going to like but this is the hard truth hot showers no steam no all of you weirdos love Hot Yoga that Take 5 hours to go in and out to actually do I tried doing it one year and I died no we don't do hot yoga spicy food I mean everything in moderation okay every once in a while it's fine but if you're going to eat like chili peppers with every meal you're going to mess up your Rosa alcohol caffeine chocolate a lot of chocolate can affect stress yes we need to start meditating in the morning certain medications the list goes on and on and on so you really do have to start listening to your skin and understanding how you're reacting to certain triggers whether it is sitting out in the sun or going into a hot yoga room or doing a steam or a sauna etc etc cooking maybe it's a perfect excuse for you not to cook and so you guys get the gist right make it work to your benefit so what are then the top ingredients that we can incorporate into our routine if we have rosacea and we're trying to help ourselves and I'm going to look for things that are calming and soothing that are going to help restore our Skin Barrier that are going to reduce inflam and that are basically Beyond The Gentle basic skin care that we think of when we think of basic sensitive skin like Cal oatmeal panol Etc glycerin we want to look for ingredients that are going to actively help reduce the look of that is the correct way of saying it if you are in the industry because you can't claim that it's reducing inflammation it's helping reduce the look of inflammation and redness number one and this is probably the most popular one on the market that I think a lot of Ros of people know about and look for directly Santella atica Santella atica is known for redness reducing properties anti-inflammatory properties it has atico sdes medas aides and aziatic acid in it which all have anti-inflammatory effects and it reduces the look of inflammation it has been shown also just side note to promote collagen production so and it also has certain antioxidants that can protect the skin from the damage caused by free radicals obviously full disclosure my brand the depuffer why do I love this product if you have rosacea because it is loaded in centella asiatica but it also has arnica and arnica is not one that is traditionally thought of for rosacea but it works like a charm because it helps reduce the redness and calms the inflammation in a synergistic way that your skin looks def flushed within a couple of minutes when done correctly at the right concentration arnica is tricky though because when you guys look for arnica products more often than not they're diluted in a homeopathic fashion this one is purely Brown because it is pure arnica the color that you guys see here this golden hue is due to the high concentration of arnica in this formulation then you have one that a lot of people with rosacea know about Dr jart Dr jart has his tiger grass which is another name for cantella asiatica color correcting treatment it's a mineral sunscreen with zinc and titanium and it has a green tint to it and a more opaque fashion versus this that is going to help neutralize the look of redness because when you're red you want green to block the red we're not going to go into the art of it take an art course that's not my jam although I do like painting number two we have sulfur I hinted at sulfur at the beginning of this video sulfur is going to be marketed as an acne treatment I.E like on this when you see eradicate daily foaming cleanser acne treatment because it has 3% sulfur but it's not really just an acne treatment it's a rosacea treatment why because sulfur helps to minimize inflammation it regulates seen production a lot of people with rosacea have a lot of overproduced seim think of the nose think of the chin and it also helps to minimize inflammation as well it has antimicrobial properties which is helpful right but not the main reason of why it works and it has mild exfoliating properties but it's not going to over strip you and Break Your Skin Barrier worse making your rosacea flare up in the process there's another product by pieter Thomas Roth they have a 10% sulfur clay mask which is much more potent than the cleanser form and then you have one available at your local drugstore called Dela Cruz where you can literally spend a couple of bucks smell like a rotten egg and improve your skin in the process so those are the sulfur products that are high up at number two when it comes to ingredients number three is AAL acid AAL acid is an ingredient that I have a honestly more of a love love relationship with a little bit of a hate because it's not elegant it pills and it messes up a formula when you mix it with other actives at the right% and in order to use aoic acid if you have rosacea you really want to be at 10% or above but above that is prescription and prescription is 15% which is sweet spot and I don't know how the prescription is formulated but it's so elegant finaa is so elegant and I do not get paid by that drug company whatsoever um but it's a 15% prescription on to over the- counter though we have paa choice this is a 10% AIC acid booster I believe um it has a little bit of licorice it does have salicylic acid I don't know the percent of Sal acid in this if you're sensitive or you think your barrier is inflamed beware don't go for it because the Sal acid might mess you up but AIC acid like I said regul Ates your anti-inflammatory properties and antibacterial properties and it helps as an antioxidant as well Dr Sam bunting across the pond in the UK has her Flawless nightly serum which is a 10% aoic acid serum as well it has 5% niacinamide it does have a Ester form of vitamin C at 2% so it's not going to be the active form of vitamin C but it might be a nice one if you are a rosacea sufferer trying to use vitamin see in the morning wanting to get away with some AIC acid I hear beautiful things I started looking into it because of you guys dming me about it so that is hers and then the ordinary this one's great at night when you have nowhere to go and you don't care who you're seeing it is a 10% a acid suspension you do kind of sometimes have to shake it I feel but it appears nice and elegant but it does pill after a while so do not be fooled by the first impression with this it's 11 bucks though so you not really go wrong and then like I said prescription number four hypochlorous acid you guys have started hearing about this all over Instagram Tik Tok YouTube I don't know what else you guys are on I can't keep up with the social media platforms but hypochlorous acid is one that has been used in medicine for decades I actually use it before every cosmetic procedure to clean my patients faces because it has antimicrobial effects and it is gentle so it's not going to over strip their skin like using plain oil isopropyl alcohol or an alcohol wipe it is now available in fancier forms at nicer stores but you can also get it at your local drugstore as a generic this is one that is available at Walgreens it is really not that expensive at all and you can use it every day on your face in the morning and at night if you're somebody who wears a mask for whatever reason at the height of the pandemic I used to spray my mask with hypoc chloris acid to minimize the breakout around the mouth area number five this is one that people don't often think of when they have rosacea a lot of people with rosacea think they have chronically dry skin over here it's always flaking but then when I ask my patients is your skin dry or oily they go it's more oily but it flakes okay it's not dry skin it's not flaking because it's dry it is a yeast living on your skin and you have dandruff of your face a lot of rosacea patients have dandruff of their face around their eyebrows right here in the corners of their nose or even along their eyelid margins and you can even see it sometimes in front of their ears and they need ketoconazol neral shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp that you can use a couple of times a week on your face to keep that yeast at Bay okay um it's an anti-fungal medicine that can help really help your face and I think when that is sort of subsided and you calm the subar dermatitis down you minimize the inflammation associated with it and your redness gets better in the long run so this is something that you're going to have to incorporate throughout the course of your life and you have to figure out the Cadence of how you want to incorporate it the shampoo is not necessarily the best as a face wash because it's not the ideal pH it might be a little bit stripping but if you use it several times periodically maybe twice a week maybe it's four times a week maybe it's once a week I don't know what the right Cadence is for you and you do it in the areas that are actually the worst letting it sit for a few minutes before washing it off you will see a huge difference in your skin in the long run also just side note I use the shampoo right here I've been using it right here when I wash my hair I let it sit for 5 minutes not because I have dandruff but because I have thinning hair there and I have noticed that my hair is starting to get thicker poor AI okay number six benzil peroxide and you're going to go wait wait wait wait wait is benzil peroxide and adne medication yes it is is it great for rosacea no it's not but if you have this little Mite called a Demodex Mite out of control on your face then benzil peroxide can be helpful for you now not all rosacea people have Demodex mites going crazy on their face but a lot of them do and the way I hear it described from my patients is that they feel like their skin is a little bit reactive and itchy not painful not irrit ated but just like this is probably the get your mind out of the gutter okay but this is probably the best action I can describe it as okay but benzil peroxide can help kill it now you don't need a 10% benzil peroxide wash stronger isn't better something like at 5% we have this in my office is great it's going to help kill that bacteria the little mites and keep it at Bay all right FYI because of the drug fact label benzil peroxide comes up as acne but this can be helpful for Demodex mites as well okay number seven my favorite zinc oxide no it's not sunscreen I'm talking about diaper rash cream Triple Paste zinc oxide is a beautiful ingredient it has anti-inflammatory effects when a kid has a rash down there you slap this all over their little tushies in a gentle way in order to minimize their rash to calm the inflammation down so they have less friction Etc on their privates when it comes to your face if you have an inflamed Skin Barrier and you're trying to restore your barrier zinc oxide can really help restore that barrier and when it comes in the form of a diaper rash cream when it's married to petrolatum it will help create an occlusive layer while calming any inflammation down and it works wonders as an overnight mask treatment especially in a dry climate or in a very cold climate or when the temperatures are changing not all diaper rash creams are created equal don't go for one with essential oils definitely don't and make sure there's no steroid in it cuz that can make things worse I was sponsored by this company after I spoke about them it was a very organic thing and that's why I took that sponsorship because I was like how funny Would it be that the one sponsorship I'm excited about is a buttpaste company but this is probably my favorite one not because of that sponsorship I have two kids who are six and four I wasn't sponsored then but this was the one that I used on my kids so that is the diaper rash cream k for that and then we're going to talk about options for quickly prescriptions but we're not going to waste too much time on this because you can't prescribe medications for yourselves at least not as of yet but who knows what the future holds but aik acid 15% that's great you want to incorporate that metronidazol is a topical antibiotic that you guys can use it's been very well studied for rosacea it is also beautiful and santra which is the trade name the generic name is itin is an antiparasitic that also kills Demodex I often times prescribe all three and I tell patients go plop ploop ploop put three dots mix mix mix apply to face twice a day and it really does help a lot with people with rosacea to help keep all of it at Bay and you can use this long term you can use aoic acid when you're pregnant you can use metronidazol when you're pregnant and last I checked you can use cilantro when you're pregnant in office we can take it up a notch and you guys can really help yourselves by reducing the Cosmetic look of redness by getting the beams vascular laser beams also pulse known as the pulse die laser which in my book is the gold standard you guys might get Groupon deals for ipls or bbls for rosacea it doesn't work as well an IPL and a BBL is a light it is not a laser you're going to need a lot more treatments and you better be going to somebody who is qualified because you might get burnt in the process because they are not as specific as a laser and you need to know what you're doing with them in order to treat your rosacea correctly and then if you have enlarged sweat glands on your nose or on your chin you can do electr surgery you can shave it down people actually use sandpaper believe it or not in conjunction with other devices and lasers to help minimize the look of that but you're probably not watching this video I am assuming if that is your case and you have timeus changes on your nose um because it's usually older white men who get that so I don't think they're watching this YouTube um but that is pretty much what we can do the bird ey view in office and the last thing I want to just say is rosacea might appear like a very benign chronic condition but it has a really deep psychological influence and psychosocial impact on people knowing that you're flushing when you're embarrassed makes you more embarrassed and makes it worse as somebody who has had 10 V beams in one year yes 10 why because I would go to the gym and I would get stopped on the street when I was working out and they would ask me do you need to go to the hospital are you okay cuz I looked like a beat I wasn't red I was like purple red and so I told myself let me just treat this with the vbm and I ended up doing 10 one year and I maintain it probably with one or two treatments a year now I treat my whole face it is really psychologically draining thinking oh my God are my emotions showing on my face and my ears so don't just down for rosacea awareness month and if you guys have any questions or comments as always leave them below but I hope you have a beautiful Saturday [Music]",

        "transcript": "hey guys it's rosacea awareness month so I thought it would be a great time to share what I'm doing with my skin over the course of a day given that I have a tendency to rosacea just like one in 10 of those of us who live in northern Europe now that means for me that I have a tendency to flush certainly if the room is too hot or I have a glass of red one which I do on occasion um or have particularly spicy food or even just fiddling with my skin a lot my skin will tend to become pink um I don't tend to get spots so much in the center of my face which is quite characteristic of papular pastation I'm more prone to the arotic type you might just kind of recognize your skin as being redness prone um so it's about knowing where you are on this kind of Continuum I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle it's definitely there I can see the little broken capillaries and every so often I'll have a little bit of laser with Dr ores to try to reduce those but I'm not too obsessive about it I think really for me what's important is that consistent daily skin care routine that manages that tendency in my skin I'm also aware of my tendency to break out I'm prone to blemishes in my lower face although a bit less now than I probably was um 5 or 10 years ago but I still consciously manag my skincare routine to reduce the risk of breaking out and then finally I'm concerned about fine lines and wrinkles you know especially around the eyes maybe a little bit of Less tness in the lower face so considering all those three things I have to be quite fussy with my skincare routine so I'm going to share with you what I do in a typical day as I do my morning routine so let's get into this we want to talk about cleansing activating hydrating and protecting but first a big no no from my skin is anything with fragrance my skin simply hates it and I put it down to probably years of testing products when judging Beauty Awards when you will have boxes upon boxes arrive at your doorstep and you have to get through a lot of product in a short space of time so that means if I want a more sensorial experience I have to scent the air so I am currently loving this newco water therapy which is actually a really gorgeous blend of Sandalwood one of my most favorite favorite ingredients um for scent comb Ed with Marine elements and sage and fur and it's a really lovely kind of nuzzy smell um so I will sprit the air away from my face and that just creates that feeling of something more luxurious my routine without putting my skin at risk right so first step cleanse I firmly believe if you get cleansing wrong you cannot get skin care right and that is doubly true if not more so for redness prone skin I am going to talk about Dr Sam's products in the video today and that is not because this is a blatant sales video this is because this is actually what I use on my skin and as a Founder if I didn't use my own products there might be a bit of an issue so don't come from me in the comments All right so Flawless cleans is the perfect cleanser for redness prone skin and blemish prone skin I formulated it specifically to meet those needs because those needs are terribly terribly common so that means no fragrance of course no skin clogging ingredients no essential oils nothing that doesn't need to be there to ensure that I cleanse my skin effectively but preserve that all important barrier function so I'm going to do one pump because this is my morning routine but if it was night time I would do two pumps to make sure I get everything off my skin so I'm going to do one pump for me with redness prone skin we want nothing rougher than fingertips all right so we don't want flannels we don't want brushes we just want skin on skin and if that means taking a bit longer and I firmly believe in a 60-second cleanse so be it I actually practice something called the physiological sigh which sounds a bit dramatic but it's an Andrew hubman technique that's thought to be the most calming kind of breath work that you can do which involves a deep breath in and a second little one which fully inflates all the lungs alv giving you essential oxygen important for skin and everything else and then a big long exhale which is very calming to the nervous system because it activates the Vegas no so I'm going to rinse that off with tepid not hot water hat skin dry don't rub now one thing I would just say is if my skin is very very sensitive or you're having an active flare up and you're getting maybe an outbreak of papules and postals and your barrias feels really dry you might want to try a cream cleanser in which case I would use the Lage p\u00e9 tarian Domo cleanser super gentle no fragrance kind of almost nothing so next step is to activate or in the case of red and spone skin I guess it's more of an anti-inflammatory thing so for me I use AIC acid in the morning so I do use brightly Serum with 10% AIC acid but what's nice about this formula is that because it's got four different actives it's quite multitasking very multitasking even so it's got puchol which is anti-inflammatory but also good for keeping pores clear calming breakouts improving pigmentation and fine mindes and wrinkles it really does almost everything that a retinoid that you're using at night will do but you can also use it in the daytime and you can use it on top of your retinoid as well for a supplementary effect it's got some es scorable glucoside in here now for me that is amazing because my skin has become quite intolerant to aloric acid which if you know a bit about product chemistry has to be formulated a low PH around 3.5 which is way below the Skin's 4.5 to 5 pH level still slightly acidic but alisic acid makes be very acidic and that can be irritating so for me it just makes me two pink two red and the scoro glucoside which is an Esther which becomes converted into aloric acid in his skin very easily is a g option and suits me better and then we have niacinamide barrier boosting pigmentation improving blemish calming which again really suits my skin so that concoction of actives together really does wonders to my redness prone aging concerned complexion now I'm going to do one pump and I'm going to do the 13 dot technique you really want the benefits all over not just on your trouble zones now of course alternatives to that include Fina on prescription which is 15% aalc acid you could use a more straightforward AIC acid from say the ordinary or polar's Choice um choose your aalc product according to your needs but for me I want as much bound for my buckers I can get I work that in everywhere I don't do that in my eye area because AIC acid doesn't really have a role in Fine Lines it doesn't have any impact on collagen that we know of now worth a quick mention I do use neutralizing gel from time to time I sometimes use it in my T-Zone particularly in the week before my period my Skin's a bit oily and I like the salicylic acid in here it's 2% for the occasional blemish and I find that whether it's a kind of more race typ bump I don't get them very often but it would tend to be more here and I have had one here recently it's quite a rare thing for me to get spot but if I do I find this works better for me um even than say benzil peroxide which can just be that bit more drying but does work well equally for some others so you kind of have to find your blemish Buster of choice so it might be Benzel peroxide and 2 and 1 half% is about as strong as you need to go or you might go 2% salicylic acid a little bit to the barrier and this is really moisturizing which means I don't get that dry cornflake patch after I've applied it so I can put concealer on the spot too but for nighttime all I would do is swap in AIC acid for something that's retinoid based now that's allowing my morning routine to take precedence in terms of the redness solution side of things whereas at nighttime I'm focusing more on the health and well-being of my dermal Matrix so that means a retinoid and if I'm a little more on the dry side I'll go nightly Pro and if I'm I don't know gearing up for something important maybe I'm filming in a week's time I'll go a little harder on the prescription side of things so this is a baji treso point not five I do think using a retinoid is really helpful because so many people who've got rosacea have also got evidence of premature aging I think retinoids at night just makes sense um but you have to calibrate it according to where your redness is at and if you're in an active flare up do not use a red oid stick to your anti-inflammatories so once my actives have fully absorbed in my skin is touched dry then I'll come on to moisturization and hydration so a fundamental step even for combination skin so 65% of us have combination skin it's normal for me usually it means just using a moisturizer according to how dry or not my cheeks are or whether or not I want in this case nide which is in Flawless moisturizer or saram which is moisturizer light now in my Oiler half of my cycle so after day 14 I tend to lean into moisturizer light um the camid are just lovely around the eyes but you know equally Flawless moisturizer I don't feel too strongly about it um this would probably give me a slightly better finished my makeup at the end of the day but i' would have to block my T-Zone a bit more so it's really swings and roundabouts using what you need when you need it and kind of becoming that expert of your own skin mastering your own skin skin knowing what it needs and when it needs it so today I'm going to do full fat Flawless Moisturizer in this luscious large size now and one pump is almost always enough for me we're just going to do you guessed it 13 dots I just find it such a helpful ritual and I almost default to it now it would never occur to me just to do that and put it all on without precision and you know I use my under my fourth finger for my my under eyee area and I really work it in cuz I want that nice smooth base with concealer application and then I'll just kind of lightly Glide it in elsewhere might do a little bit of massage it feels good get the knuckles in there and then you know work it around your upper lip just don't miss bits um and I find if you stick to doing one or two fingers with your application technique you get a more thorough layer of hydration to all the nooks and crannies and then when it comes to your makeup you just don't get those dry patches time care and consistency and I do the same amount on my neck direct my neck okay good final step is to protect and sunscreen is almost as important as your actives when it comes to managing redness prone skin and for me I'm a mineral sunscreen obsessive because it suits my skin so well and particularly with a little tint because it just helps mask redness so I've got a lot less to do with my Cosmetics so I'm going to go in with gosma tint one um good news on the gosma tint two front guys any day now it's only been 3 years so yeah and I'm going to be really generous with it and it's going to look a bit scary and then it'll look fine because that's what minimal sunscreen does all right so we're going to do two thin layers and I'm going to do a bit of flawless daily sunscreen on my neck which is untinted because life is too short to deal with tinted sunscreen on the neck and then I'm just going to do my neck a bit of flawless daily sunscreen in a pinch I can do without moisturizer on my neck and it's got some ni cinnamide in there which is such a great ingredient for my neck but it is just a great moisturizer as well so lovely shade that's face and neck protected and perfected so I just done my makeup of camera um I did film that so if you want to see it let me know in the comments and really I think you need to learn to master your skin I'm really passionate about that that kind of is the premise of the whole Dr Sam's brand is Know Thy skin know thyself Know Thy skin so I hope that seeing what I do to my skin in a typical day helps you build an effective skincare plan so you can enjoy the benefits of healthy glowing skin thanks for joining me guys see you again soon",

        "transcript": "the three best products from the ordinary for rosacea prone skin if you do have rosacea it can be very difficult to find products that work well rosacea naturally is much more sensitive than even dry skin or sensitive skin and there's a lot of different things that can trigger rosacea such as eating spicy foods drinking alcohol or even going out into the Sun rosacea is primarily a vascular condition meaning the little blood capillaries that are naturally in your face are at the root cause for why this flares up for some people and although it's normally this redness in the cheeks rosacea can have pimples it's not the same thing as acne but they can look like acne and it is possible to have both rosacea and acne together these are the three best products from an ingredient perspective that should be okay for rosacea prone skin and that have the actives that have the potential to help and the first one actually mimics what dermatologists prescribe this is the salic acid ten percent in silicone and as a liqu acid is a really cool ingredient you may be familiar with other skincare acids however this one is much more gentle and for rosacea prone skin it can help dermatologists actually prescribe a 15-percent as they like acid solution for some patients with rosacea you can't get that over the counter it's too high of a percentage to get without prescription but this is at 10% and you can find other solutions that have 5% etc this helps with the redness of rosacea but it also helps if you do get those little white pustules those pimple like looking things and azalea kasih does also help with acne in case you have both as the oleic acid can burn a little bit when being put on the skin so do be aware of that but it is one of the ingredients that once the skin builds up tolerance to it can actually help to protect your skin a little bit more over the long run meaning that rosacea prone skin is less likely to flare up from other ingredients being used somewhere down the line because this is an a dimethicone base it's really nice and smooth onto the skin kind of like a primer the only things that it can ball up if you go at it too aggressively so I would recommend starting by patting it on the other thing is that as a liqu acid can be used day and night no problem dr. Sam is a dermatologist that I love and admire and she has used azalea Cassatt on pregnant and nursing patients for those who are pregnant earners it's hard to find skincare that is safe for both you and your baby so it's nice that this is an option and the other thing is that it's fairly unreactive so it's generally okay to use with most other things in a routine because of its silicone base it does work best after your serums either as a step before your moisturizers are kind of in place of your moisturizer or before your sunscreen since it has that silicone butt next you do have to consider sunscreen yes sunscreen can be used to help combat rosacea and the reason why is because the Sun is one of the major flares we see rosacea being vascular can be triggered by a lot of things but most people who suffer from it say that sun exposure is a big one sunscreen and the prevention of the UV rays from damaging those delicate little capillaries inside of the skin is really important not only to prevent it from flaring but to actually keep it under control and down regulate the steps that are already happening in your skin this is a mineral sunscreen from the ordinary I really love this one a lot of people have sensitivities to some of the chemical ingredients in sunscreen a lot of those are things like a boban zone oxybenzone octinoxate Homo say late those are not necessarily bad things however for people with sensitive skin they can be stinging they can be irritating and especially for people with rosacea prone skin the skin is already hypersensitive so you don't want to offend it more this sunscreen is an SPF 30 it's a great option that you could put on in the morning and the other thing is that it does have some other ingredients in here such as urea and such as Alan toen we've spoken about these ingredients before on this channel but as a little reminder these are both very soothing to the skin specifically urea can be helpful and Alan toen has been known to be anti-inflammatory which if you're having a rosacea flare-up would be very useful because we're talking about redness you know that this includes a recommendation for the niacinamide and zinc 10% this is really one of the best solutions that the ordinary has when it comes to large pores oiliness and redness and seeing as rosacea is this redness condition this vascular condition this is a really great place to start niacin amide otherwise known as b3 is a water-soluble vitamin and it really can do amazing things for the skin in combination with the zinc it helps to not only stabilize this but really target the areas of the skin that are experiencing that redness it take a little bit of time and some people have noticed that their skin kind of purges which means it gets a little bit worse before it gets better on initial application of this but especially for those who are struggling from rosacea that has the little white pustules or if you have rosacea and acne in combination this can help to down-regulate your skin's natural oil production so bye-bye grease that could be contributing to some of that and on top of that down regulate the redness that is normally associated with those flushes and those flares total transparency if your rosacea is really bad none of these products are gonna work once you get past kind of a critical point you really do have to go see a dermatologist and get a prescription or make sure it is rosacea and it's not acne in disguise there are also other types of redness in the skin such as erythema that are different than rosacea and need to be approached differently but lucky for you we have a whole bunch of guides on how to use the ordinary products as well as deep dives into basic ingredients and different skin conditions so that you can understand how to be a conscious consumer how to turn and learn your ingredient labels figure out what's in there and work with your healthcare team in order to treat and overall embrace and understand your skin if you learn something here make sure that you that like button and don't forget to brush that's subscribe button if you haven't already more videos can be found right here and I cannot wait to see you beautiful bunch of lies in the next video love you guys bye",

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare product recommendations for persistent facial redness I know it's really frustrating to deal with I really hope this video was informative to you guys everything I mentioned will be linked in the description box if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "[Music] hello my name is dr sam ellis and i am a board certified dermatologist welcome to my bathroom in addition to practicing both medical and cosmetic dermatology in northern california i am also an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at uc davis and i'm a consultant for skin care companies and i help them develop products that are evidence-based tonight i am going to be taking you through my anti-aging skincare routine [Music] now a lot of people kind of bristle at the anti-aging term and what i mean is not that i don't want you to be getting older as a physician i i want to get older i want my patients to be getting older because the alternative is not great but you might not want your skin to look weathered or tired i want my skin to be plump and youthful and healthy and that is what this skincare routine is all about but in sort of a low maintenance streamlined way all right we've got the towel on the hair is back we are ready to rock and roll with a nighttime skincare routine a little bit of background about my skin is that it's not particularly oily it is not particularly dry it is somewhat sensitive because i have a skin condition called rosacea which makes me prone to redness and flushing especially with a glass of wine but i don't get the pimples that some people with rosacea do get which is really lucky for me but i do have to be mindful that some products do irritate my skin and that i'm a little bit more sun sensitive i also spent my whole life outside i'm from california i was a swimmer and i played water polo through college so i have a lot of sun damage that i have been working on for the past several years but that is also something that i'm trying to tackle in my nighttime skincare routine so the first step of any skincare routine in the evening is going to be cleansing your skin the whole point of this is to remove all of the junk and debris that have built up on your skin over the day maybe take off makeup or sunscreen not or sunscreen definitely sunscreen if you don't have sunscreen on your face we're gonna have a problem but you need something to take that all off because if that's just sitting on your skin while you sleep that's gonna clog your pores make you more prone to breakouts it's going to make your skin look dull so you need to cleanse that off and the other part of cleansing that's important is that it sets your skin up to absorb and interact with the next set of products that you're going to put on it i am a huge fan of the double cleanse and i feel like if you're watching this you probably know what a double cleanse is but for those who don't the double cleanse is basically a two-step cleansing process where you use a more oil-based cleanser to remove that top layer of debris that's on your skin and break up some of the product and then you use a second cleanser usually a water-based cleanser to wash that all away so today i am going to be using the clinique take the day off cleansing balm as my first cleansing step it's not waxy it's almost creamy but holds its shape and then as you put it into your hands you can see the warmth from the body just melts it all away but all that product is still sitting here and i'm going to massage it into my face and the whole point is to really just break up that product and you can start to see my tinted moisturizer coming off you can see that redness of my skin underneath but i like to see the redness because then i know that my makeup is getting removed so i usually will take this up onto my forehead in the eyebrows i usually grab a little bit more for my eyes i feel like breaking up the eye makeup is so important you don't want today's mascara to become tomorrow's eyeliner because if you've ever fallen asleep with your makeup on you know what i'm talking about and if you haven't then that probably made zero sense to you so i'm just massaging really gently and delicately around this i'm going over my eyelashes and really trying to press the product down and away in a second i'll peek and see what kind of scary mess i've created oh yeah that's good that's really good and so at this point everything's broken up i'm gonna get it wet i'll just get my fingers damp and then we do something called an emulsifying process where i add a little bit of water to the product and you can see it turns kind of white and creamy and that really helps with the cleansing that water grabs onto the product and the product grabs onto the dirt and oil and makeup and sunscreen and lotion that's on your face and now i'm going to dip down and cleanse see in a second got all of that cleansed off and now i'm ready for my second step of the double cleanse but you can see like i don't really have eye makeup on anymore you can start to see the texture and the color of my skin meaning that i feel confident that my makeup has been removed with that step for my second step i'm going to use the vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin i hope there's some still in here i use this a lot yeah we're good so this cleanser is sort of like a pearlescent gel i really like it i feel like i need a lather in my facial cleanser at least one of the steps i might have been brainwashed by the cosmetic industry i don't care to me this makes it feel like something is really happening i like this cleanser because it's sort of a no-nonsense it's not an exfoliating cleanser it's really just the purpose is to get your face clean so i just kind of massage it go down my neck normally i would do this stuff in the shower so usually i would do my cleansing balm emulsify it and then hop in the shower wash my face and body in the shower and then come back out and do the rest of my routine but if i take this into the shower this video is going to take on a whole nother life so this is all massaged in go over my eyelashes one more time make sure everything's really good drop back down it's going to rinse it off all right so the face has been cleansed and when i'm done cleansing my face i don't want it to feel dry or tight but i also don't want it to feel oily or particularly hydrated yet i just need it to feel ready to accept whatever i'm going to put on it next i feel like if your skin is feeling too dry or tight after you cleanse you might need to switch your cleanser either to one that has a lower ph so something in the five to six range sometimes a more basic cleanser that sits more at the seven to eight range and the ph can be more stripping for the skin and although some skin can handle that a lot of people can't and so that's one thing to look for in your cleanser if you're noticing you're feeling really dry the other thing is that you can look for ingredients like glycerin or shea butter in your cleanser because those are hydrating ingredients that can support your skin while you wash once i've cleansed i'm in the home stretch that is honestly the thing that takes the longest in my entire routine the next thing i'm going to do is put on my trusted tretinoin so this is a retinoid this is a prescription strength retinoid and you can see this tube is very well loved so well loved that i am worried about getting some out of the tube right now a little more all right we're good pea sized amount that's all you need it takes me a while to get through one of those tubes because that's all you need for your entire face so when i'm putting a retinoid on i do the dot method i think this is not new for any body but that helps me sort of distribute it but a little goes a really long way with this product i just put any extra that's on my fingertips kind of down my neck the neck skin is so much more sensitive than facial skin because it does not have the same density of hair and oil glands that the face has so it doesn't have the same repair abilities and so you have to be really careful with the neck because you go in with 0.05 tretinoin and you might be sorry the other thing i will sometimes use on my neck is like a retinol so a retinol is a not prescription strength retinoid it is something that's weaker than tretinoin because it has to be converted in the skin into retinoic acid it has to be converted into tretinoin and therefore in that conversion it gets weakened quite a bit and so sometimes i'll go in with that on my neck or even around my eyes i don't want to spend too much time talking about retinoids even though they are amazing because you could probably find a million excellent videos here that go into more detail but essentially retinoids are vitamin a derived compounds that are the best thing you can do to anti-age your skin in terms of product besides wearing sunscreen which is in a category and a class all on its own so retinoids which include things like retinol retinal adaptolene teseratine triferitine tretinoin they can be over the counter or prescription and they do it all they support collagen synthesis so they help you make new collagen which makes your skin bouncy and glowy and less saggy fewer fine lines fewer wrinkles they help break up pigmentation in the skin they support new vessel growth and a lot of people are like oh i don't want new vessels but deeper in the skin which can really make your skin glow the other thing that they can do is they can actually fight something called cellular atypia so as your body is exposed to more uv damage over your life the cells in your top layer of skin can start misbehaving and that's what leads to skin cancer so as part of a skin cancer prevention treatment i put a lot of my patients on a topical retinoid retinoids increase collagen synthesis so collagen is the protein in our skin that makes it look bouncy and glowy and in our mid-20s we lose one percent of our collagen in our skin per year which is devastating so how do we combat that using a retinoid is the best way and that is why it is a staple in my routine it will never leave my routine unless i was trying to get pregnant or if i was pregnant the reason for that is that these are vitamin a derived compounds and they have been shown when taken orally to cause birth defects so no anti-aging in the world is worth a birth defect a lot of people will caution about using retinoids when someone's breastfeeding i personally would have no problem using a retinoid while i'm breastfeeding i'm not worried about a birth defect at that point the baby is out so just don't put it on your nipples and you'll be fine so most nights i will use a retinoid maybe once or twice a week depending if i feel like my skin is looking dull or if i just want to like a little extra i will do an exfoliating step instead of my retinoid i never use a chemical exfoliator plus a retinoid in the same night that is too much and overkill but one of my favorite chemical exfoliants are these peel pads by skin better they are a combination of lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid and then their own proprietary retinoid blend but when you take one of these and you swipe it over your face you get the sting okay that's the sting that tells you something's going down on your skin in a positive way i would not recommend doing a retinoid and this in the routine unless you're used to it basically otherwise you're going to over exfoliate your skin you're going to over aggravate your skin but for me i've been using a retinoid for six or seven years at this point and i need another exfoliating agent to just get some of that dead skin cell layer off the top so i can have a true glow and doing a peel pad or some type of exfoliating step usually a chemical exfoliating step not a physical scrub is what i like to do in my routine to just give me a little glow next after my retinoid is on i go in with a moisturizer this is the la roche-posay tolerane ultra this is a super mild but very hydrating moisturizer this is like five pumps i want a lot okay this is super thick and creamy it's basically like a pumpable cream usually i tell patients creams come in jars they're thick like frosting this is just just below that it is the thickest lotion you can imagine and i i adore this now it's on the back well this is going to be really smooth tomorrow but i probably use four or five times more moisturizer than i do of a retinoid i want more of it oh it just feels so good i like this because it feels really nourishing and no matter how angry or upset or if my rosacea's flared or if i overdid it with my retinoid and my skin feeling temperamental this never ever stings and i really appreciate that about this product i also see a lot of patients in my clinic who have sensitive skin who have allergies to things like fragrance or certain preservatives and this product just doesn't have any of those so i always feel really confident recommending it to people with sensitive skin because i think they'll be successful the only time i might not use something this sick is someone who's really acne prone who has a ton of clogged pores because it does have a lot of moisturizing and occlusive ingredients in it but oh i love it feels so good all right so retinoid is on moisturizer is on that's it it's the one two punch i mean it's pretty darn simple i do use something called azelaic acid in the morning to help combat my rosacea and i use vitamin c and sunscreen but in the evening for anti-aging retinoid and moisturizer now i don't exclusively rely on my skin care to contribute to my anti-aging plan or goals i do use neuromodulators so botox in my face to help with fine lines and wrinkles and creasing that happens over time i also do a mild resurfacing laser a few times a year something called clear and brilliant which helps break up pigment in my skin and also supports collagen synthesis the last thing i do is something called pulse dye laser so pulse dye laser is a laser that targets redness and you're probably looking at me going well i can see redness in your face oh you you can't even imagine what it would look like without the laser okay uh these tools that we have in a dermatology office are not to help someone achieve true you know there's no such thing as perfect we're just trying to optimize make someone feel more confident you don't need to look like an instagram filter that's not even a realistic goal you just need to look like you and feel confident in your own skin and sometimes a little enhancement never hurts anybody but i just want to be totally just totally transparent and that i get support from in-office procedures and i don't exclusively rely on my skin care if you're someone that does bravo but if you're someone who doesn't bravo to round out my nighttime skincare routine we cannot neglect the lips oftentimes i'll actually put my moisturizer on over my lips as well just to start softening them and then i'll go in with something more occlusive so something with a more jelly like or vaseline texture to really lock everything in so i'm going to use my aquaphor oldie but a goodie as you can see that's like a pretty thick i mean it's 40 vaseline or petrolatum excuse me and so i'll just put that on my lips to get everything nice and hydrated the rest i rub on my cuticles so in a clinic day you know i see 20 to 35 patients in a day and i wash my hands probably a hundred times that's sadly not even an exaggeration and so my hands take a huge beating so part of my nighttime routine focuses on my hands so anytime i showed you any of these steps any leftover got rubbed down my neck on and onto the back of my hands and that's really important to me but now i've got my retinoid on my moisturizer on the skin has been properly cleansed the lips are feeling juicy i think i'm getting ready to go to bed that's it thank you so much for following along in my nighttime anti-aging low maintenance skincare routine i just wanted to show you that even as a dermatologist who has access to all of the things this is what i choose now just because that's what my routine is it doesn't mean that's what your routine has to be but you should know that you can work smarter not harder and that an effective skincare routine does not have to be extensive or expensive it can be if you want it to but it certainly doesn't have to be if you would like more skincare tips from me and just to follow me around the office see what the day in the life of a dermatologist is like hear me talk about dermatologic procedures and medical dermatology you should follow me on instagram my handle is super

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "kind of feel like I'm the poster child for the benefits of azoleic acid it literally has done for my skin what no other skincare ingredient or product has done and that is keeping my rosacea and inflammatory skin at Bay just look at how my skin has struggled with rosacea over the years and look at it now I have been using over-the-counter azoleic acid skin care products for the last few years and I've already done videos on some of my favorite products so I'll link those at the end of this video and also in the description box below I'm not really going to go into that today what I'm going to do is answer the question I get repeatedly asked here on YouTube over on Tick Tock and Instagram and that is how do I layer azelaic acid effectively in my skincare routine so just a very brief overview of azoleic acid and its benefits to the skin if you're new to this particular ingredient azelic acid is a naturally occurring and skin identical ingredient just meaning that it is already present in our skin so known terosinase inhibitor which is responsible for producing melanin in the skin skin which gives color to our skin which is why as an ingredient azelic acid is great to Target hyperpigmentation issues and also melasma it also has exfoliating properties it is not an aha or an alpha hydroxy so it doesn't perform exactly the same as glycolic acid or lactic acid but it can help to smooth out your skin tone and even out your texture basically a gentle option that can even suit sensitive skin types but the greatest benefit for me has been its antimicrobial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties this is what makes it ideal for rosacea and acne prone skin helping to calm and soothe and reduce the inflammation Associated redness and pimples this is why I turned to this ingredient in the first place because I have struggled for years with the side effects of rosacea my skin is combination it's sensitive from rosacea prone it also tends to be dehydrated and when my rosacea flares It's My Skin Barrier that is very much impaired some of my triggers I know and recognize and others I don't even know what they are overdoing things in my skincare routine is definitely a trigger because if I compromise my barrier by using too many active ingredients all at once or things that are too strong for my skin will set my rosacea on fire drinking red wine I hate that one because I actually like drinking red wine and the Sun is one of my biggest triggers so I try to mitigate those wrists as best I can I wear a sunscreen I focus on my skincare routine and really focus on maintaining My Skin Barrier and I limit the amount of red wine that I drink the regular use of azelaic acid just simply cannot be understated for me when I put together my morning and evening skincare routine I just follow a very simple philosophy and that is maintain and prioritize My Skin Barrier at all costs so that means being flexible with my routines if my skin is in a compromised State I will adjust my skincare routines to be simply hydrating and really focus on that barrier repair but if my skin skin is in good health like it is right now in the morning I like to prioritize a vitamin C because I want the well-aging benefits associated with it and in the evening I sort of revolve my routines around the regular use of a retinoid using acid exfoliation limited just because of my skin and hydrating skin care so how does azoleic acid fit into all of that it's quite simple really let's start with the morning azoleic acid and vitamin C actually do pair very well together I say that but that is also with a bit of a caveat vitamin C is an ingredient that lots of people are irritated with that sounds like I'm saying oh vitamin C you're pissing me off today A lot of people are irritated by vitamin C that doesn't even sound any better A lot of people have irritation on their skin when they use vitamin C I think that makes sense but if you use vitamin C regularly and love to gain the benefits from it then pairing an azaleaic acid with that works really well try it on its own to see that you have no issues with the product and then try pairing them together if you're good you're good for my morning routine I like to cleanse with water only it just works really well to maintain My Skin Barrier rather than using a cleanser I reserve that for my evening routine we'll talk about that in a moment I also like to tone my skin after cleansing and that's because toners these days are just packed full of nice hydrating ingredients and then I wait for my skin to dry before I apply my vitamin C serum then I apply my azoleic acid and then I apply a moisturizer and then a sunscreen and that is my morning routine I tend to follow the philosophy of thinnest consistency of products to thickest consistency of products but I do make exceptions the azaleaic acid that I'm currently using is a prescription strength this is a 15 azaleaic acid it does have a creamy texture so in terms of texture it sort of sits well in my skincare routine at that point this is a 15 azaleaic acid most over-the-counter products are going to be under 15 and can range anywhere from three up to 10 percent is normally what I see just showing you the texture here it really sinks into the skin quite nicely but don't always believe that more equals more over-the-counter options have shown to be very efficacious as well even in a range from three to five percent I've seen lots of people say that azelic acid does better after some of your active ingredients in your skincare routine but if the azelaic acid you're using is a much thinner consistency you could put it earlier in your routine if you wish I don't really know that there is a true hard and fast rule on that but I've been doing it this way for a couple of years and it seems to be really working for my skin so there's your anecdotal evidence at least from me I love that vitamin C and azelic acid pair so well together because I can really combine all the well-aging benefits that I'm also trying to Target in my skin combined with what I need to support my rosacea azelic acid can have some side effects for some people including dryness and flaky skin some people find that it tingles or stings a bit upon application I haven't had that experience and perhaps it's because I did a slow introduction when I introduced it initially when I started using over-the-counter osceolaic acids I was only using it once per day in my skincare routine when I moved up to the prescription strength my doctor recommended that I use it twice in my skincare routine so both morning and evening that's particular to my needs so of course if you're using a prescription strength azolacic acid you'll be in consultation with your medical professional moving into my evening routines I'm just going to explain a few of the routines that I sprinkle throughout the week starting with a hydrating skincare routine I usually do a routine like this every other day that I'm not using a retinoid or an alpha hydroxy acid it gives my skin the chance to repair itself and I find it's a really good strategy for my rosacea skin and prioritizing my skin barrier as much as I want the benefits of well-aging products and retinoids in particular throughout the week in my skin skincare routine for me it just doesn't work so well that way because my skin will get easily compromised and then I'm back to square one let me know in the comments if you're able to use a retinoid every day or if you're kind of like me and have to balance it out with other routines just to be sure that you're not damaging Your Skin Barrier if I'm doing a simple hydrating skincare routine I would double cleanse my skin that's using an oil cleansing balm or a micellar water to remove all the dirt oil makeup sunscreen debris from my face followed up with a water-based cleanser again I would apply a toner to my damp skin after cleansing then I would follow up with my hydrating serum or serums I like to use face oils and then a moisturizer on the evenings that I use an alpha hydroxy acid I do not use a nasolic acid in the same routine Alpha hydroxy acids for me are already borderline irritating for my skin that routine I need to hold kind of sacred and be very very careful because overdoing it with an acid can easily set my rosacea on fire so when I do that skincare routine for me it's once a week and I get great results from doing it that way so I really don't need to do it every single day but I know some people like to and can double cleanse apply my toner apply my Alpha hydroxy to dry skin and then follow up with a face oil and moisturizer and that's it as for a BHA or a beta hydroxy acid I do the same thing I typically use a BHA on its own once per week and so I keep my azulaic acid out of that routine however when acelic acid is formulated with a BHA salicylic acid then it's no problem and this one is really great from Paula's choices they're 10 azoleic acid booster formulated together with salicylic acid a lot of the times people get hung up on what can and cannot be paired together when it's formulated together all of those things are taken into consideration it's when you're layering products yourself acting like a little cosmetic chemist in your bathroom which I love to do that is when you can be at risk or an increased risk of irritation because there's no formulation in there helping those two ingredients to work synergistically together and reducing the level of irritation but could you layer them together yes if your skin can tolerate it you can that's the beauty of azelic acid it fits in well with other skin care products very effectively for my retinoid night I have found no issue with layering azelic acid in my retinoid together I typically use a retinaldehyde and if you don't know what that is or anything about the retinoid family don't worry I've done a video explaining everything there is to know about retinoids because I was so confused when I first started using them I'll link that at the end of this video and in the description box below for you as well so for that routine I would double cleanse tone my skin apply my retinol to dry skin apply my osceolaic acid face oil and moisturizer I hope this video has helped you understand how I put together my skincare routines using azoleic acid and for me prioritizing it in both my evening and morning skincare routines be sure to drop your azelic acid questions comments and experiences in the comments section below if you haven't already watched these videos be sure to watch them next and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "foreign board certified dermatologist welcome to my channel thank you so much for your support thank you for your support on Tick Tock as well we're nearing 1 million friends there thank you for the top doctor Awards Seattle met magazine and Castle Connolly it's been a great year and so I'm really excited to see what 2023 has for all of us and cheers to more fun thank you guys and today is going to be a video I might say rosacea on the title or on the thumbnail but really this is for all of those people out there with sensitive skin including myself during the winter my skin tend to be more sensitive I wouldn't say in general I have sensitive skin but skin types do flip around with the weather you know there's normal oily dry combination sensitive skin types sensitive skin though I definitely do find is something they can flip around based on the weather and definitely in the winter time where we have cold weather you have the heaters on overnight you can wake up with really dry chapped lips and I get irritation around my cheekbones where it gets pretty red and noticeable during the day and how do we hide redness what products do we reach for when we have irritated skin so it's not just for rosacea today it's for those with sensitive skin and when we have irritation a lot of times we panic and we reach for whatever's on our bathroom counter we kind of overdo it and we get into this whole vicious cycle of the redness worsening and so we're gonna go over some gentle products today that you can consider now rosacea let's talk about rosacea if you have rosacea I see this on a daily basis in clinic and it's a chronic inflammatory skin condition where you get redness on your face flushing and you can also get acne rosacea where you get these acneoform red papules or bumps on your face usually around the nose inner cheeks the chin and it flares with stress alcohol sunlight for sure heat so a hot shower taking something hot out of the oven getting that blast of hot air in your face can really trigger whether it's redness and flushing or red bumps and there are different types of rosacea like postula rosacea rhinophymodus rosacea where you get the red nose with bulbous like changes where you have really enlarged oil glands that can be tough to treat and also deep rosacea called granulomatous rosacea so they're different types of rosacea but in general when you have rosacea you're already put into the ultra sensitive bucket in 2020 I saw a lot of people with rosacea having flares of the rosacea because they were on Tick Tock and they saw a popular Korean sheet mask and so people were using it and they got really bad irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from using a sheet mask so be very careful with your new products always start one product at a time about two weeks apart and if you want to spot test on your neck or a small area of your face first I'm all for that if you have rosacea and a lot of people with rosacea can't do those anti-aging skin care ingredients we talk about including vitamin C or ascorbic acid so I always say 10 is kind of like what you're looking for for ascorbic acid going to 15 or more will really increase your risk of irritation La Roche Posay has a lower than 10 percent ascorbic acid they're C cream this is the one that has five percent ascorbic acid metal Castle side and also neurosensing which is soothing as well well especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin and the other ingredient that's notorious for causing acne rosacea flares or rosacea flares would be retinol or retinoids things I prescribed especially the stronger stuff tretino and tazeratine can irritate rosacea and a lot of my patients or rosacea we can't do chemical peels on them because their skin is so sensitive chemical peel what the acids could bring on a flare if you want to use a retinoid I would recommend an over-the-counter retinol that is less potent than the stuff I would prescribe and what can we use for that one good product I like to talk about a lot on this channel is Olay retinol retinol 24 is a nice formulation because it has glycerin it has niacinamide and I like niacinamide combined with my sunscreens cleansers moisturizers and retinol that is anti-inflammatory great for those with acne or rosacea prone skin because it also regulates sebum production and helps with inflammation so it won't clog you up and cause a flare this is a very gentle retinol I would recommend either the max or the retinol 24 plus peptide OG one without the max the max is 20 percent more of their High hydration complex which means maybe more glycerin more niacinamide I don't think it has more retinol I can't tell by the labeling on the website and they don't disclose their retinol percentage either other one that's a little bit more pricey than this because Costco has the OG in a two pack for a great price go for something more expensive like Keels I like this brand a lot this is their micro dose retinol whereas their fast relief is a higher percentage this one here is 0.2 percent and much lower strength so if you're a beginner this is a great one but you also get some additional anti-aging benefits from the peptide in this topical peptides are great because they're self-signaling and they help increase collagen production through cell signaling so I like this one a lot one pump gives you that yellow retinol pea sides amount and you just use that to your entire face so that's a really nice retinol that's gentle now if you can't tolerate any retinol another thing you can consider that's anti-aging would be Heparin sulfate containing product like sente this is nice because this also has cell signaling capabilities increase College gent this is very gentle nice for those with rosacea and they can't use a retinol this is a good option but also an expensive brand but I say worth the price very gentle one pump gives you what you need for your face it comes out as a nice moisturizing cream a little thicker texture there soothing and also effective as well so I like that brand a lot they also came out with a new pigment correction kind of a mask you leave on for 15 minutes I have to review and I'm gonna try to get my hands on to that one but that one's also like 150 bucks for that I know some of you have asked to review that when I release my melasma video so I'm going to look into the brand sentence pigment corrector mask okay now going on to daily routine besides anti-aging what can you do I say have a gentle cleanser you don't have to go crazy with exfoliants lhas ahas bhas and your cleansers I think something gentle like vanic cream vanicream's a king when it comes to sensitive skin care and so their cleanser is great I love their daily facial moisturizers awesome so affordable you can find that Target your local drugstore or online on Amazon and so it's a great brand so reliable I even use that for my kids I use that as like a body wash for my kids and you can use this as a body wash as well their facial cleansers CeraVe is a good one they're hydrating facial cleanser and the winter time is also a great pick lasts forever get the big value size at Target or online and it lasts forever now if you wanted to talk about anti-aging and moisturizers and you can't do the retinol peptide moisturizers topical peptides like we talked about have self-signaling and so we mentioned that with the Keels retinol has peptide and also I forgot to mention Olay has the pomatoil pentapeptide four peptide complex which is also anti-aging the peptide moisturizer by the inkulus just do a little pump there and you can dispense the cream skin fix is another nice brand you can get at Sephora this is their triple lipid peptide cream which is also nice that I've used quite a bit also dispense by pushing on this and gets the cream out very good for sensitive skin now if you have irritation like myself around the cheekbones and you want to sue that I'm all about petrolatum based ointments and this is a small cute mini version of what you get as a tube CeraVe healing ointment and you just put just a small amount around your cheekbones at bedtime so that you don't wake up with a red face or redness on the cheekbones and that's my routine at night but right before I go to sleep get a good fresh layer of ointment over it whether it's Vaseline Aquaphor CeraVe healing ointment I love them all if you have a lanolin alcohol sensitivity or allergy stick with Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment Aquaphor has lanolin in it but it's quite a rare sensitivity or allergy so most people tolerate Aquaphor just fine another thing you can consider would be La Roche Posay secoplast bomb B5 this one has a B5 plus because I got this in Europe when I was in Paris but this is a great product you can get at your store but it has been selling out people on Tick Tock are using this on their acne lesions because it helps with wound healing but the ingredients in this don't actively fight acne it's more for healing has glycerin panthenol shea butter very soothing doesn't irritate my skin comes out as this paste you can put a small amount around your your cheekbones here you can layer it with your Aquaphor you can put this on first in Aquaphor Vaseline or CeraVe healing women over it but you see how it comes out as like this white paste but it does rub in well and then you get this kind of dewy finish here so totally fine to plan your face not comedogenic at all I like this one a lot this is a staple in my household ever since I discovered this let's talk about the most important thing sunscreen because sunlight will trigger acne rosacea flares and it's not good for those with sensitive skin because UV radiation will break your Skin Barrier up and make you more susceptible to allergens irritants and such I've talked about ltmd UV clear quite a bit on the channel this is nice because it has niacinamide in it and I like niacinamide containing sunscreens for those with rosacea and acne prone skin because it helps with the sebum but also inflammation comes in the tinted and non-tinted form tinted is great if you have hyperpigmentation as well this has zinc oxide and oxanoxate this is about 36 to 40 bucks though for 1.7 fluid ounces if you want a dupe something cheaper there's Dermatology this brand I've also talked about on the channel this is a Universal tinted moisturizer which is the dupe of the tinted Delta MD they're both SPF 46 they both have niacinamide this one though is a little over 20 bucks so much cheaper than this one and also 1.7 fluid ounces and comes out very nice lightweight one of my favorite sunscreens out so I'll just put a little bit here just to show you that it's a lighter tint very lightweight that it won't stain the inside of your mask as readily as the other tinted sunscreens out there very soothing good for sensitive skin moisturizing as well has some hyaluronic acid to help hydrate so I like this one a lot now in terms of other sunscreens besides tint you want to hide redness because this can help how you redness pretty well these lighter tinted sunscreens you can go for a Green Tinted sunscreen like Dr jar Dr jart sico pearline they have the color correcting cream with SPF or their tiger grass camel drops with SPF 44 this one's really nice almost looks like a matcha colored sunscreen here guess I'm running out but it's a nice one it's good to have Green Tinted products when you have rosacea because the green will help mask your read very well and you don't look green you don't look like the Hulk after it rubs in really well and hides so if you get a little redness around your nose you can put that sunscreen there Dr jard is a little bit more expensive but I say it's totally worth the price you got the zika in it which is soothing anti-inflammatory zika's really taken off recently and this is like K Beauty brand especially in the K Beauty World cintella asiatica has really taken off and it's very soothing so great for those with rosacea I'd say wear your sunscreen every day reapply especially if you're Outdoors reapply every couple hours if you're gonna get sweaty or exercise jump in the pool any kind of water activity you want to reapply every 40 to 60 minutes because your sunscreen will wash off pretty readily even if it's water resistant you got to reapply quite frequently if you're indoors and you're not by any window just wear your sunscreen in the morning before leaving the household and that should last you for the day if you are by a window glass though you should be technically reapplying every couple of hours because UVA will still come through the window glass and deactivate your sunscreen within a couple of hours okay so I hope this video helpful I had a lot of fun talking to you guys again about skin care and things you can do at home before you see me because a lot of times we have to prescribe prescription topical medicines or even oral medications for acne rosacea or rosacea and sometimes even do v-beam or pulse die laser for the redness the broken blood vessels we call pelandictasias see your dermatologist to talk about how to layer your prescription medicines and what medicines could work with your skin care products because we want them to interact and cause irritation as you know like we talked about it's a chronic condition without a cure so it's an ongoing battle and sometimes it's trial and error and azelic acid might work for one person and it might not work for the other patient so taking things slow trial and error being patient and not adding too many things at once taking things one step at a time okay so please hit the like button please subscribe to the Channel please share with your friends with sensitive skin and I'll see you guys for the next video guys okay take care peace foreign",

        "transcript": "rosacea is a condition i commonly see in clinics so in this video we're going to talk about what is rosacea how to best treat it and i'm going to offer some of my skincare tips for those of you who suffer from rosacea hi my name is dr jenny liu i'm a board certified dermatologist in minneapolis and welcome to my youtube channel so what is rosacea rosaceae is a chronic and inflammatory skin condition often characterized by skin sensitivity along with a tendency to flush and look rosy and red but also may develop pimple like bumps especially along the central face so the cheeks the nose the chin and the forehead and that is a very big definition of rosacea because we know that rosacea have various different presentations in fact we even used to categorize rosacea into four subtypes we still do for more academic purposes but for when we are seeing a patient in clinic we don't use those subcategories to really treat the patient we treat based on the clinical findings and the symptoms because we know for most individuals with rosacea they'll often have kind of a collection of various different subtypes number one is called erythrometal tylangitatic and that is the redness the flushing that we often see like the cheeks the nose the chin sometimes it can be very severe and large broken visible blood vessels can be present sometimes awareness often will flare with certain triggers and those triggers are different for everyone but common things would be heat wind cold spicy food stress chocolate caffeine all the good stuff subtype two is papular pustular rosacea so this is more than kind of what they used to call adult acne even though it's not truly acne but often gets misdiagnosed or mistaken for acne will present it is these pink zit or pimple like bumps and sometimes even pustules often on the nose the cheeks and the chin the third time is called phymatis and this has to do with chronic inflammation and over growth of your oil glands essentially often will present as more like a bulbous skin bulbous nose and that's called rhinophyma with uneven surface and texture with dilated pore like appearance but that feminist change can also be seen of the forehead as well as the chin and lastly the fourth subtype of rosacea is ocular rosacea and yes you can definitely get rosacea in your eyes often these patients will have like a dry and gritty like sensation grading the sensation in the eye sometimes eyelid margins can get crusty they can get styes and the whiteness of their eye can look more red and injected as i mentioned earlier most individuals will have a spectrum of these conditions and well being having the type 1 and type 2 so the flushing the redness along with pimples being the most common presentation that we see so why does rosacea happen you know unfortunately we are still trying to elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea so we don't completely understand it however we do know that it is very common affects 60 million americans and we often see it in like in the late 20s and 30s not so much in their kids and teenagers tends to present in adulthood now genetics do play a role in rosacea we tend to see this running in families as far as what is happening underneath the skin we do know that there are certain things that we see in rosacea patients that we don't see in individuals who don't have rosacea so number one there is a defective skin barrier and that could be a reason why often rosacea patients will complain that their skin is more sensitive either to products or to the environmental triggers there is increased interest epidermal water loss so the inability of the skin to hold on to water and tend to be more dry flaky and dehydrated we also know that there is actually a decreased amount of lipid production of the stratum corneum in rosacea patients similar there tends to be a an immunogenic so pro-inflammatory response for some reason and the inflammation will generate a cascade of reactions leading to production of enzymes that will generate inflammation but also can degrade collagen and we think that inflammation in part is what's responsible for the redness and those pimples that we see in rosacea patients furthermore there is what we call a neurogenic dysregulation so hypersensitivity along with again that clinical presentation that we see of being more sensitive to certain triggers and lastly there tends to be a hyper reaction to an organism that lives in the oil glands so there is a mite called demodex mite that we see in six percent of the normal healthy population there are these little bugs that you can actually even scrape out of the skin and put on a slide and clinic sometimes we'll do this and you can see these little prolly little critters and it's like i can't believe this just came out of my skin but in rosacea patients we found that there tends to be a higher density but not only is it the presence of these mites but we think in abnormal response to these mites is what is associated with the more popular and postular variant of rosacea now as mentioned earlier there can be common triggers for individual rosacea but one of the biggest risk factors is ultraviolet radiation we know that uv radiation is pro-inflammatory damages dna generates inflammatory response reactive estrogen cdc's and also upregulates all these inflammatory cytokines that already are pre-existing in rosacea patients that will often make that worse which is why it is super important to be doing thorough and diligent sun protection on a regular basis furthermore we know that in individuals who are more red and have dilated and broken blood vessels the sun often will make that worse so how we treat rosacea really depends on the presentation so if it's redness often lasers avoiding triggers certain prescription topicals can be helpful at temporarily reducing the amount of redness and obviously camouflaging is helpful when it comes to the papules or the pustules acne like bumps often prescription topicals and sometimes even oral medications are necessary for really severe cases i mentioned earlier oral antibiotics and sometimes even oral retinoids are used for severe cases but those overgrowth of sebaceous glands laser and certain type of procedures can be helpful next i'm going to offer some tips for general skin care and some of my personal favorite skin care products that i recommend for my rosacea patients the most important thing is if you do have rosacea is to see your dermatologist because like i said often prescription medications are really going to be helpful to help your rosacea get under control but nevertheless proper skincare is still going to be really really important and really the foundation as always you want to test out any products before using them and when it comes to skincare gentle is the way to go and less is more i recommend just a good gentle cleanser once or twice a day from cerave their hydrating cleanser vana cream facial cleanser is another really good one just find one that is going to be effective but not over strip your skin's natural oil now moisturizers are really going to be the key at helping to hydrate moisturize prevent trans epidermal water loss and really help to repair your skin barrier one of my favorite products is the one from cetaphil their redness relief night moisturizer this is very calming and soothing it contains ceramides niacinamide and shea butter and it's just a really good moisturizer and this is one of you that i have found that when my skin is like say recovering from a chemical peel and tends to be more sensitive it will not burn and has never burned my skin similarly another one that i personally love and use all the time is the two layering ultra moisturizing cream from la roche posay this is a thicker moisturizer contains glycerin thermal spring water shea butter and the neurosensing which is a peptide that they've actually done clinical studies on using this product on rosacea patients and has been found to have an anti-inflammatory and calming effects so this is one that i also really love one more moisturizer that i like especially to spot trace certain really irritated areas is the event sickle fades restorative cream and this is a zinc based zinc is really helpful for repairing skin it's used a lot in healing this is definitely kind of more white and pasty thick enough to even use on chapped lips if you need again something that can be really helpful soothing to the skin pretty thick so probably would use as needed to spot treat definitely can use it all over your face but i find that to be too a little bit too sick and heavy been occlusive and for those who want a lighter moisturizer either to use in the morning or if you have more oily skin the two that i've always recommended to my patients are one from cerave their pm facial moisturizer this is great i mean it says pm but it's lightweight it's oil free great to use under sunscreen in the morning in fact i do that sometimes as well as the laura's procedure and double facial moisturizer both of these are really helpful they're both oil free fast absorbing both contain ceramides and nice cinnamon that's gonna be helping to repair skin barrier and soothing so it's really just like a toss up i honestly love both and kind of will rotate through both of them depending on my mood now one last product that i have really been liking when my skin is just super sensitive is using an overnight sleeping mask one that i found to be really soothing and calming is the one from skin fix the redness relief overnight sleeping mask and this contains honey peptides and other calming ingredients and you wear it like a sleeping mask so you would wear it over your moisturizer and you will sleep in that it really helps to hydrate the skin repair the skin barrier and it's just very soothing and it really feels really good when you put it on your skin and it's kind of formulated for those with more sensitive red and rosacea prone skin so i would love to know if you've tried this please comment below and let me know what you think now i cannot finish off a rosacea video without talking and stressing the importance of wearing sunscreen i've talked about various types of my favorite sunscreens in my previous video and i will link some of my favorites that i think are well suited for rosacea prone skin down below in the description box but sunscreen is one of those no products that the best one is the one that you like enough that works well for your skin that you will remember and want to wear on a daily basis in general rosacea patients tend to tolerate mineral based sunscreen a little bit better just because often with this chemical sunscreen it can be more irritating and can burn but i have found a handful of mario's tissue patients including my skin that tends to be sensitive can tolerate certain types of chemical sunscreens it really all depends on the formulation here is where you have to try you want to make sure you're putting on enough most people under apply so at least a teaspoon for your head and neck reapply it throughout the day and this is really important because we do know that ultraviolet radiation come through windows and most of us because we under apply and your sunscreen gets rubbed off throughout the day that is going to make a huge difference when it comes to protecting your skin so really make sure that you are reapplying using the proper amount so those are some of my favorite skincare recommendations i hope you guys found this video helpful and let me know if you have rosacea if you have tried any of these products that i've recommended i'd love to hear what you think about them similarly if you have a holy grail product that i did not mention today comment below because i would love to try them out myself and hopefully recommend them to my patients as well if you enjoy watching this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel again you can follow me on my various social media accounts until next time thanks

        "transcript": "well hey everybody welcome back to skincare with Chris Gibson if you're new I'm Chris I am your skincare expert I'm here to help you get your best skin ever and on this channel we talked about skin care products skin care routines skin care problems and today we're talking about rosacea and what products you can use to help combat that problem so if that's your thing please hit the subscribe button and the little notification bell so that you get notified when my new videos are up okay so finding skin care products actually will work when you have rosacea is a really tough go especially when you're talking about face washes and sunscreens anything that has chemical components because and I know you know this or you wouldn't have clicked on this video rosacea gives you a very sensitive skin most people think it's just redness but it's very very sensitive skin so it's my goal that by the end of this video you have some products that you can choose from and trust that will help you calm and reduce and soothe rosacea outbreaks or episodes all of the products I'm going to talk about today are in the video description box below and they are dermatologist approved and they can really really help now just like acne which I talked about on this channel incessantly I know since I have such a personal history with that rosacea is along with eczema and flama Torrey disease of the skin a lot of the same things that can trigger acne actually trigger rosacea and eczema so things like food things like skin care ingredients things like stress all can make these episodes and flare-ups happen so having the right skin care products and routine in place can really go a long way to keep flare-ups at bay and the really good news is that the products I'm going to talk about today they are so inexpensive okay first up at any routine of course is cleanser it's very very important that you use a cleanser that is not over drying and irritating Aveeno has an ultra calming face wash that's very good for rosacea it's a very mild formulation it's water based and it's infused with a botanical feverfew which has been shown to reduce redness and inflammation so it's a very calming face wash the other great thing is that it's fragrance free which is really really important when you have any kind of skin condition because fragrance can read really irritate your skin so this one is water-based fragrance free and will not strip your skin of the natural oil that it needs to be healthy it's also great at removing makeup for those of you who wear it so this makes an excellent choice for a cleanser for rosacea next up is moisturizer of course and moisturizer can really be a troublesome thing when you have rosacea because a lot of the common ingredients in skincare products are very irritating to this condition la roche-posay has a really wonderful moisturizers are called tolerate double repair face moisturizer it is also water and glycerin based it also has niacinamide which is really good for reducing inflammation and redness it also has ceramides which help your skin rebuild its actual structure and help it hold in moisture now if you're someone who has a lot of redness with your rosacea you really going to love this next product a Veen brand has an anti bred day soothing cream this is a really great light product formulation that also has a tint of green to it so that it automatically erases the red tones that rosacea produces now one of the best times to treat rosacea is at night when your skin is in its natural repair cycle and for a night moisturizer different brand which you've probably heard of before because they are the ones that have the different gel for acne which is a deplane well they have a night restorative cream that you can use or a night moisturizer it has hyaluronic acid ceramides in a lantern to help improve your skin's texture overnight so again while your skin is in that sleep repair cycle this particular product is going to deeply moisturize and heal your skin and just so we know how this all works ceramides are really important ingredient in that they are lipids that attach themselves to the skin help repair the skin structure retain moisture without irritation hyaluronic acid is a really important ingredient because it's part of your skin's natural structure abduct your skin already produces it it's super super hydrating and it really does help with cellular turnover and a lanten sounds like I'm saying Aladdin but it is kind of a magical ingredient it's made from the root of comfrey you've probably heard of comfrey tea as an herb it is able to soothe irritated skin and it actually helps the skin produce new tissue so again this Euler formulation for a night cream is a really superb choice now a lot of folks with rosacea have a very difficult time tolerating any kind of a serum because of the concentrated nature of the ingredients now la roche-posay has a very light anti redness reducing serum which is a very very well formulated product in fact it is so light it's really more like an essence spray but it too has red tone reducing ingredients that will take the redness out of rosacea without irritating your skin now another product that is super hard for people with rosacea to find that will work for them is sunscreen Cetaphil has a specially formulated moisturizer with an SPF of 30 and the great thing about this moisturizer is that it's mineral based and not chemical because it's the chemicals in sunscreen that can really trigger rosacea flare-ups them you guys who have it know what I'm talking about so this particular moisturizer and it's very inexpensive can be used as a sunscreen so you're gonna be totally protected without irritating your skin and it has caffeine and a lanten in it as well that will help reduce redness while it protects your skin from the ultraviolet and UVB UVA rays all of that now all of these products together can give you a really superb skin care routine that's gonna allow you to use products that won't irritate or trigger an episode of your rosacea and yet let you get the really great benefits of good skin care now I hope this video today helps you figure out some products that can really help you out with your rosacea please in the comments below let me know what your top skincare concern is because if I haven't made a video on it I probably will thank you guys so much for watching and supporting the channel I can't tell you how much it means to me please stay well stay beautiful and I will see you guys over on the next video",

        "transcript": "if you struggle with sensitive skin and figuring out what products to use and how to incorporate them into your routine I have you covered I'm going to walk you through a simple effective nighttime skincare routine for sensitive [Music] skin if you're new here welcome I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified dermatologist in Northern California and I'm really here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if you enjoy that type of content give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel I wanted to take you through a sensitive skincare routine because it's just such a common issue that patients run into is having sensitive skin and not knowing like well what's safe for me to put on my skin what's going to cause me problems and one thing I tell my patients as a dermatologist is what sensitizes your skin and what your skin can't handle might be very different than what makes someone else's skin sensitive so these are General guidelines the products I've picked for you today are things that I think would get along with a wide variety of skin types but again you're always going to want to listen to your skin and if you try something that I recommend that does doesn't work for your skin get rid of it now two things I'll say before we delve in is one if you have insanely sensitive skin like everything you are putting on your skin is causing burning or itching or pain or a rash you need to see a dermatologist and if someone came into my clinic with those issues I would be trying to take their skincare routine essentially down to zero I call it putting you on a skincare diet where we are trying to eliminate all potential irritants and allergens from your routine and often times that routine is like a cleanser and maybe a moist moisturizer now with this routine it's a little more in-depth than that because I feel like people come to this channel because they want more than just like a cleanser and moisturizer in their routine you can certainly build off of that so I've picked some things that kind of honor an anti-aging routine that would be good for mature skin or skin that kind of breaks out so I have some other things in my routine that I'm offering up for you tonight but if you have truly super crazy sensitive skin like keep your routine minimal minimal minimal second thing is I have my own skincare brand prequel that is specifically designed with sensitive skin in mind I could make a whole bunch of different nighttime skincare routines for sensitive skin with prequel alone and I would be obsessed with them but I also think it's important to talk about other brands other products I am a skincare junkie I like things from more than just my brand and so I have tried to pick products that sort of venture outside of prequel for tonight's routine but if you do want a prequel only nighttime skincare routine let me know in the comments I will happily put that together for you all right enough chitchat I had a very long day in clinic today it's 10: p.m. and I have a long day in clinic tomorrow so let's do the nighttime skincare routine first step is we are going to cleanse we are going to take the day off I was in clinic all day it was a big surgery day for me so I was excising a lot of skin Cancers and I was wearing a mask and goggles most of the day so I don't have that much left on my face I have probably some tinted sunscreen left over from the morning some mascara but that's kind of all we're working with and one of my absolute favorite cleansers for sensitive skin and honestly just like favorite cleansers in general is the bioderma myell water I go through one of these bad boys probably once every four to 6 months and I just cracked open a new bottle like a week ago so she's fresh I particularly love this for sensitive skin because it has very few ingredients so very few things to potentially be sensitive to now if you have sensitive skin that doesn't mean you can't use products that have very long ingredient lists but if you're potentially trying to sus out if you have an allergy or an irritation reaction to something in one of your products if you're working with something that has you know 10 or fewer ingredients that does make that process a little easier iier this is also fragrance-free as will everything I talk about today be not that I want to demonize fragrance but there are a lot of people that have sensitivities to it or it can make you sensitive to other things in your products so why not just like take it out of the equation if you're not familiar with my Celler water I'm just shaking it up to make sure it's an even distribution you can kind of think of it like a makeup remover gentle cleanser all in one I like to put it on a cotton round so I will saturate a cotton round with it and then I will essentially just like gently swipe it over my face if you have sensitive skin you don't want to put a lot of pressure because even though this is gentle cotton like it still exfoliates your face it still has those rough fibers so you just want to be so gentle with how you handle your skin but I swipe this over my entire face I will also take this down my neck because I have sunscreen on my neck usually I'll be hopping in the shower for a body shower but that didn't lend itself well to this style of video then I even go down like into the cleav just like get it all off and then once I do a first pass you can see there's my tinted sunscreen left over I will do another round so I'm saturating another pad and this time I'm going to do my eye makeup a lot of times I get asked is my cellar water good enough to take off eye makeup and it really depends which one but this bioderma one is exceptional I like to kind of press it over my eyes like a pirate and I'll usually let that sit there for 10 or 15 seconds before I then swipe it away and start to take that off but you can already see like it's breaking down my makeup pretty quickly same thing on this side I like to let it marinate for a good 10 15 seconds that allows the mellar water to start breaking down the product and that way you're not putting as much friction or irritation around your eyes oh wow this is when my husband chooses to run the dishwasher great great great and then I just do like one last check around the periphery of my face I find so many people are bad about cleansing the periphery of their face especially if they do it in the shower like if you're not washing your hair and your shower cap is of like AB budding this area it gets poorly cleansed so I just do like one extra pass to make sure we are really working with clean refreshed skin and now here's the cool thing about my cellar water you don't have to rinse it off and that can be your only cleanse like I feel very confident that that has taken off all of the stuff I had on my face out of habit and probably just out of like compulsion I am going to Splash a little bit of water on my face but you really can just leave it on your skin now if you have really sensitive skin it's not going to hurt to do a little rinse afterward but you can also think of my cellar water as like the most dilute gentle cleanser ever so it truly doesn't need to be washed off but alas I can't help myself I am just going to put a little water on I will gently Pat my face dry and then we can move on I just realized I do have a prequel product in this routine okay but just one I gosh I like couldn't help myself um this is the prequel Universal skin solution it is hypochlorous acid if you don't know what hypoc chlorus acid is I have an entire YouTube video about it that you can watch but it's like a very gentle refresher for the skin it's antimicrobial it's anti-inflammatory it's what I use every day in my own Clinic to prepare my patient skin for procedures so it helps cleanse the skin and what I found is sometimes people who have very sensitive skin have like lowgrade irritation going on from their environment or they have an unusual microbiome so the bacteria and fungi and viruses that sit on their skin sensitize it and so using something like hypoc chloris acid in your routine can be so helpful I love this one in particular because the Mist is just so beautifully fine I often will use this after I work out but it's also so gorgeous in a nighttime skincare routine and it's so refreshing we launched this product over a year ago now and since then so many of my patients have come in and said that this like truly saved their skin whether they were dealing with like perioral dermatitis or a little eczema patch people put this on bug bites and just like random rashes I don't know if you've ever seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding where like Windex is the Cur all the number of patients who have made that analogy to the prequel hypoc chlorus acid is actually hilarious now my cleanse is officially over I could just go in with a moisturizer here and be done but I also wanted to pick out a couple of things that I think are really nice for anti-aging and just sort of like smoothing out the skin that can be nice things to use if you have sensitive skin now anytime you're using any Anti-aging products in your nighttime skincare routine we generally refer to these as actives because they are actively asking your skin to do something or signaling your skin to do something in theory any of these could cause irritation but one thing I like to do before I apply those and what I recommend to my patients who have sensitive skin is I have them apply a little bit of a buffer onto their skin before they go in so that often is in the form of plain old Vaseline on the lips of course you can use other things on the lips as well but Vaseline is one ingredient so if you have very sensitive skin or you find that your lips are always chapped or peeled you're not going to be sensitive to Vaseline and I'm going to talk about two different anti-aging skin resurfacing products tonight and I wouldn't use these in the same routine I'm going to do half on one side of my face and half on the other obviously not what I would recommend to you but I want to show you the textures of both of these one of these is a retinoid product so retinoids are things like prescription tretinoin retinol retin aldhy they are vitamin A derived molecules that have been shown to help with things like lines and wrinkles they stimulate collagen they help even out pigment they are just such great anti-aging ingredients to have Incorporated and it's one of the things I recommend to basically all of my patients if they care about that stuff however retinoids are notoriously irritating to the skin and can cause a lot of dryness and peeling and that often doesn't last forever but it can be quite a long acclimation period somewhere between like weeks and several months so the one I'm sharing tonight is just exceptional because I find that you can acclimate to it quite quickly but it's also very very effective and that is the medicate Crystal retinal one so it is a retinal deide product so that's a step up in potency and efficacy from retinol which most people are familiar with but it's level one and this goes all the way up to level 20 and that's something I really like about medicate is that they create their retinoids in sort of gradients so you can start with something less potent if you have sensitive skin or you're a beginner and then you can work your way up as you tolerate it also retin alahh is traditionally kind of tricky to formulate with it's hard to keep it stable and effective but medicate has a great technology approach to this and their products with Ral theide are wonderful I'm just going to put this on half my face cuz I'm going to show you the other one on the other half of my face but it's nice and creamy you just need like really thin layer I would say one pump for your entire face but I also really like this because you can use it on your neck a lot of people can't use prescription retinoids on their neck cuz it's too irritating but this one's fantastic so I'm going to take that all the way down down even on the chest on the hands too why not let's go crazy once someone with sensitive skin is able to tolerate this every single night on their skin without issues then they could go up to the next strength aside from aroid I'm also going to show you an exfoliant that I really like for sensitive skin I would certainly not apply a retinoid and an exfoliant in the same nighttime skincare routine but a lot of people like to do a retinoid most nights of the week and then maybe incorporate an exfoliant on one to two nights just to kind of help clear the skin a little bit faster if you're blemish prone acne prone sometimes that can really help with texture and often times exfoliating acids work a bit faster than retinoids so it can be a nice thing to incorporate into your routine once in a while if you have sensitive skin I would consider exfoliants like a nice to have but not a must have if I had to prioritize retinoids versus exfoliants to Me retinoids overall do more for your skin so if you can only tolerate one of those things in your routine go with the retinoid and an exfoliant I really like for sensitive skin this is actually my second bottle is from peels it has a long name though it's clearly corrective daily retexturizing triple acid peel and it has daily in the title I personally would not use this daily but I think that's probably why it's great for sensitive skin it's because it's gentle they've designed it to be used daily for some skin types I think if you have sensitive skin one to two nights a week would be perfect I'll show you the texture of this on the other half of my face what a sacrifice I would never use these in the same routine like I said I'm just want to repeat that I'm using it on the side of my face that I did not put the retin alides but it's very liquidy and this has salicylic acid glycolic acid and lactic acid so a gentle blend of alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids and I'd probably do maybe like five to six drops for the full face I wanted to give this option because not everyone can use retinoid so for example if you're pregnant or you're trying to conceive you shouldn't use a retinoid but I personally am completely fine with my patients using exfoliating acids during that period in their life um and the thing I love about this is there's no sting sometimes you put an acid on you're like oh dang that's spicy there's no spice to this and I actually really like that exfoliating acids are really nice for adding a little bit of glow to the skin they can help with hyperpigmentation and they can help fade dark spots faster they can also help with congested pores so lots of good benefits to exfoliants but again if you have sensitive skin sometimes it's hard to find one that works but I really like this one so at this point we've cleansed our face we've protected our lips we've applied our active the last step in this sensitive skincare nighttime routine is moisturizer and the moisturizer I am showing you guys tonight and I've never talked about this brand before on my channel I don't think is by vetted Derm lab it is their M2 Rich moisturizer so this is actually a skincare brand developed by some of my Dermatology colleagues and I think the whole point of their brand was to create products that don't have a lot of the common ingredients that people can be sensitive or allergic to so when I have a patient who I suspect has something called allergic cont dermatitis meaning I think their skin is coming in contact with something that is inducing a skin allergy and especially if I think it's something that's in their skincare I will recommend a product like this because it doesn't have a lot of the common things that people can be sensitive to and that's not to say this is perfect there are ingredients in here any product that has ingredients in theory could be sensitizing to some people but I find that this tends to be quite well tolerated and this is just like a really nice rich creamy moisturizer I think they have another one called M1 that's more of like a daytime lightweight but I find that a lot of my patients uh either have mature skin or they're like seeking out something with more hydration so this is really nice for that I have a little bit of a problem with how they Market uh their products because it's a lot of like talking about Clean Skin Care and that really doesn't mean anything but I also understand it from like a dermatologist perspective because people are going to be seeking out their types of products if there may be looking for non-toxic skincare or clean skincare which again like any skincare could be clean or non-toxic what they're really trying to communicate is that their products don't have stuff that a lot of people may be allergic to so it's really good for like allergenic skin that feels lovely I believe this vetted Derm lab also has a cleanser and a vitamin C and maybe a retinoid as well so if this kind of thing is kind of interesting to you or you find that you have a lot of skin allergies check them out and of course everything I talked about and used in today's

        "transcript": "good morning good morning welcome back to the Vlog today I am GNA of course start my skincare routine and I was thinking about those of you out there with Rosa you deal with burning stinging symptoms of sensitivity when you use your skincare products with rosacea people develop redness on the cheeks little bumps that are red and filled with pus but in people who have deeper skin tones those skin signs sometimes are missed um or are not as obvious especially to the untrained eye and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up getting misdiagnosed and they have rosacea so talking about symptoms with your doctor is one of the most helpful pieces of information for guiding the diagnosis of Ros but symptoms include burning stinging itch sensations of warmth in the face that come and go as well as discomfort in the eyes and of course problems with skin care products and cosmetics if you have rosacea cleansing can be a really delicate tricky balance because definitely can burn and sting and can wear away at your already kind of weaken Skin Barrier to make those symptoms of sensitivity worse a lot of cleansers burn and sting so use a really gentle mild creamy cleanser if you're feeling really sensitive use lukewarm water and try just washing your face once a day cleansing oils and cleansing balms are a great option to remove um dirt oil and Cosmetics first because they're less likely to burn and sting got to get the drips off all right I'm coming in with the healthy renew face serum I've really been enjoying this now this would be a good option for a lightweight hydrating serum if you have sensitive skin because this whole product line is meant for people with sensitive skin and it's moisturizing to help minimize the symptoms of sensitivity but it's this particular Serum is not heavy sometimes heavy moisturizers for people with rosacea can actually elicit a flush not everyone but some people so the face cream in this line I really like but it is very rich so if you are sensitive to really heavy moisturizers and you want something more lightweight go with the serum for my sunscreen today I'm going to use a cavey hydrating sheer sunscreen I reviewed this a while ago it's a hybrid sunscreen it's water resistant um it's all right um but I want to use it up you know I buy these products to try out and review and then I want to make sure I finish them so they don't go to waste this hybrid sunscreen is more the consistency is more of a almost a fluid it kind of is like a cross between a fluid and a cream hybrid sunscreen just means zinc plus some organic AKA chemical filters so the cast in I find is a lot less noticeable in comparison to an all mineral but I also find that these hybrid sunscreens are a lot less likely to sting in comparison to the organic AKA chemical sunscreens so if you find that organic sunscreens chemical sunscreens burn sting but you're put off by the heavy white cast of an all mineral sunscreen try a hybrid sunscreen it's a nice balance it's not a zero cast though if you have a deeper skin tone it will show up but it is a lot less noticeable and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up using the hybrid sunscreens and they say you know after a while it just kind of Blends in and it's not so bad it all depends on your background skin tone though I wish these Brands would provide samples that way you know how it's going to look on your skin before you buy the bottle because while I like to think my reviews help you guys in deciding whether or not you're going to buy something or not you can't really tell just looking at how a product looks on my skin how it's necessarily going to look for you anytime somebody leaves a comment in any one of my videos like saying is this a good sunscreen for oily skin almost always either on a video or like a Tik Tok or something almost always there'll be someone who's like I've got oily skin I love this it's my Holy Grail then there'll be another P person who's like no stay away it's too greasy it's too oily so even those you know those kinds of things it's like you kind of just have to try it for yourself honestly um to see if it ends up working this one is a little bit shiny it's water resistant though which is nice like for humidity and sweat easy to tolerate around the eyes for me again that's another very individualized thing one thing too about sunscreen is that it also helps with the impaired skin barrier and helps reduce symptoms of sensitivity once you have it on there because it's you know helping to reduce water loss and limit penetration and irritance into the skin it's almost like a barrier cream in a sense depending on the consistency especially and sunscreens like this with zinc um are soothing you know zinc can be is anti-inflammatory although some zinc sunscreens are in my experience and yours cuz you guys have told me on the drawing side so I mentioned to you guys the other day that this like new thing that I've been enjoying doing is listening to my audio book which I'm still making my way through um it's called Uh Crossroads anyway so at night to unwind like when I'm making dinner I like to put my headphones on and just listen to the audiobook it kind of helps me tune out and like keeps me from you know Doom scrolling in my mind of just like things that I need to do and it just helps me inwind anyway but you know something about that like you've got to wash behind your ears is the point I'm trying to make like it's a it's an area where a lot of people end up forgetting to wash but um especially if you're wearing headphones a lot because back here you can get a lot of oily buildup and CC dermatitis I actually like to use an anti-dandruff shampoo back here to to clean behind my ears this is an area where you know similar to dandruff on your scalp and SE dermatitis on your face you can get this oily flaky itchy inflame buildup so I like to do that and when you're wearing headphones a lot that creates a moist humid environment that's really more favorable for that little yees malesia so it can make you know this kind of problem behind the ears even more of an issue for you so stay on top of clean it behind your ears kids so I bought this blood pressure monitor cuff on Amazon I've been pretty happy with it because it will syn to an app on your phone so you can keep a log of your blood pressure and heart rate I find that is something that's really useful a useful metric like I'm not I try to not get too into like tracking all these Health metrics because it's sort of like what are you going to do with all that information then you just become like you know somebody who just writes down numbers all the time like how many steps you got in a day like how many hours of sleep and it just becomes like to what end you know what I mean but uh all that to say having a Rec of your blood pressure readings over a period of time it can be a very useful information uh to provide to your doctor because a lot of people um deal with what they call white coat hypertension meaning your blood pressure goes up in the doctor's office cuz maybe you're nervous stressed out um they call it white coat hypertension like because they attribute it to being nervous about the doctor but honestly it's gotten to a point where the amount of time you have to wait in a doctor's office is so frustrating that it gets your blood pressure up too so it should be like um you know waiting room waiting room hypertension like the stress of of having to wait anyway um so I got this and I've been really happy with it the cuff is um standard size and it it also will fit a large larger arm and it's been doing well so yeah it's it's useful and I I think you know like I said what what good are all these numbers well like if you go to the doctor's office and you have a higher a blood pressure reading on the higher end they're probably you know going to tell you to maybe check it again and you know it can kind of be a thing so having this and having a record to show them is really helpful because a lot of times your blood pressure will will run a certain way and it'll be very different in the office so that's handy to have I've got my little pumpkin back there I'm still burning the Tuscany trick-or treat candle the cupcake one it's not my favorite favorite scent I think I've complained about this already in multiple Vlogs and I have re I purchased a new another candle on their Halloween set that I'm I'm itching to buy I'm itching to to light into but I have this thing in my personality where like with the candle I'm going to burn it unless it's like really really foul which this is isn't it's just kind of like you know I know Tuscany can give a better candle profile um unless it's just really foul I'm going to burn that thing all the way and I'm not going to start a new candle until I finished it some people burn more than one candle at a time and let the the fragrances like mingle and I bet that's really nice if you get the right pairing but I'm always like on the fence about if I should do that or if it's going to be like weird and and and mess things up like I think one of my favorite to skinny candles is the Lemon sugar cookie and I really think that the lemon sugar cookie would be nice over like some of those more Berry scents I think that would be like a nice kind of way to blend those two but I don't know what would go good with cupcake maybe a cinnamon scented candle so it was a gorgeous day on this Sunday I had to get out I could not spend it inside as you can see the sky is really really blue and gorgeous I'm over by the River Oaks neighborhood where they're all these Mansions I love to drive by these houses and just Ogle them lot of them have these like massive walls in front of them so you can't really see them too well but over the holidays this neighborhood is really fun to come to because they go all out lighting up their mansions and they all look beautiful uh it's just something to see something to behold I wanted to go to Memorial Park um and so that's a bit of a drive but it kind of ended up to be a fail because actually I could not find a parking space uh because everybody wanted to get out which like I've said in other Vlogs I try and get outside as much as possible during the day it's actually really good for your sleep cycle for your mental health to get outside in during daylight hours and spend time Outdoors uh as much as possible like especially if you work swing shifts can really help set your clock back so because I couldn't find a place to park I ended up coming over to Rice Village uh area and they have that nice walking trail uh getting some Cloud footage here I just think it's so Zen but I used to walk around this uh Park a lot um in my older apartment but I I haven't been here in a while it's always a fun time let me know in the comments I think some of you went to Rice so hopefully this footage brings back fond memories of your own stomping grounds but uh I love the pretty oak trees that line This walking path I did not know that this existed this Garden back here it's for the students but I had to come and check it out they have all sorts of beautiful flowers the garden was actually closed but you can it is open to the I guess open to the public um during certain hours yeah here's a little sign I guess um some alumni donated money for this garden and the idea is like to have a space for students to come and like learn about gardening so maybe one day they will have their own garden all right so I am going to show you guys some double cleansing in action here uh this particular night I decided I was going to use I've been using that DHC deep cleansing oil that I got from sty and I have rather been enjoying it it's very similar to the hot alabo cleansing oil um similar ingredients like olive oil but it has an aroma to it to it it has I think it has Rosemary in it so you can definitely smell that but it's a pleasant cleansing oil to use one of the reasons I love using cleansing oil so much is they're just a effective at removing Cosmetics like on this particular day I'm wearing uh that Lancome adol mascara I'm also wearing their waterproof eyeliner and this really does a good job getting in there dissolving it breaking it up I can't do makeup removers I always burn my eyes sting my skin if you have rosacea we were talking about this at the beginning of the Vlog but if you have rosacea um and you're looking for a way to remove makeup try cleansing oil or cleansing balm alternatively another good option is Cold Cream like the pwns cold cream is really a good option because it dissolves the makeup but it also is like very soothing um I don't you know they call it cold cream and it does kind of feel nice and chilled going on the skin but the oil is another option or a cleansing balm the main difference between like cleansing balm and cleansing oil it's just the balm is solid at room temperature I also started using the um isant yam root vegan milk cleanser oh my gosh those of you with sensitive skin rosacea consider this mild cleanser because it's such a pleasant experience it's free of fragrance it's very hydrating it has this like slippery texture to it which may be offputting for some but I really enjoy it it almost kind of cloaks your skin in a hug as it Glides across the surface of the skin and gently cleanses without disrupting the underlying Skin Barrier you see with the double cleanse approach the first step the oil cleanser is kind of just like getting in there and breaking up residue buildup on the skin surface the second step with the mild cleanser is actually getting in there and cleansing everything away so that's why I like doing it that way typically I do the second step in the shower but I decided to do it here so you guys could see this cleanser in action and as you can see it took everything off well hey guys I am all clean moisturized hydrated got my tread noan on but um one of the things I was thinking about you know on Sundays I do a Q&A over on my Instagram and I also post it to Facebook or basically I just you know post a still image of myself and I say hey drop any skincare related questions in the comments of this Instagram post or this Facebook post and I will usually answer you know a handful of them as many as I can and I post the question and the response to my Instagram stories and it's saved in a highlight bubble if you go to my Instagram profile anyway one of the questions I got today was like how do you deal with dry eyelids especially if you live in a cold dry climate and I got to tell you petroleum jelly is a game Cher for dry eyelids or eyelid eczema because it prevents water loss really well and it also um prevents penetration of irritance into the skin so it really is a is a great option plus it's free of common allergens and irritant I mean it's basically your immune system really doesn't care about Vaseline so that's a good thing it's just like an inert little barrier support there it's really underrated for all the things you can do it's also beneficial for cutting down on chafing wind bur if you live somewhere cold and windy um what a day y'all today was gorgeous like so nice when the weather is beautiful because you just want to be outside and so soaking it all in and such a mood boost I'm telling you summertime here can get a little like you know winter months get in other places because it's really just too hot to safely be outside for long stretches of time so you kind of get a little you know the a bit of the Blues in the summertime but that being said I really love summer and I find that you know I'm happy as can be throughout the summer cuz I like all of the summer festivities like the summer holidays and summer food summer fruits I really like summer and I love the beach so I don't know winter here I I don't mind because it's pretty mild but winter is not not where it's at for in my mind like no thanks uh I'm not I'm not Team Winter I do like winter when I don't have to go anywhere then it's fine you know it's like all cozy with a fireplace and my coffee and it's relaxing sure winter time sounds Divine but the realities of existing places that have strong you know intense Winters no thank you I don't want to be out there shoving now no thanks defrosting uh the windshield I hate doing that uh I hate driving in icy conditions cuz it's not fun although I got really good at driving in snow when I lived in Colorado like I had this little trick sometimes I get stuck in the snow like in a parking space like you'd park somewhere and then maybe you'd be parked there for a while and then we get a huge dumping of snow and you kind of have to dig your car out the car I had at the time I remember I would get in it and you know you kind of like try and dig some of the snow out as best you could heat up the car so it was somewhat def you know defrosted and then I remember I would like move it forward and back and forward and back and then I would like myself I would I could rock my own car and I could get it to rock out of the out of the space and float away I got good at that you know there's certain things that are really intimidating but once you learn how to do them and you just become comfortable and it becomes a necessity that you do it and do it efficiently then it's like not a big deal anymore like parallel parking is one of those things where you just put yourself in that situation and get uncomfortable a handful of times eventually it will just be like no big deal um that's that's a lot of things like if there's anything that you are intimidated about doing or you're like apprehensive you just kind of have to throw yourself in that situation and I mean provided it's not like hazardous to your health or something you know what I mean like within reason just throw yourself in that situation and be uncomfortable for a couple of times and eventually it just be such a non-issue that you'll start doing it all the time and you'll look back and be like why was I ever freaked out about doing this it's like non B deal all right y'all I am going to wrap this Vlog up I've had a great day I hope you have had a great day thank you so much for watching to the end if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and number two for working with us on this video as well as helping make this rosacea education and information possible but remember this is not medical information that's for your doctor to give you do remember to reapply your spf especially if you have rosacea and always remember to be youtiful both inside and out i love you beautiful butterflies and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye you",

        "transcript": "do you have sensitive skin today we're talking about what's up everyone I'm back we're back he's back I'm Dr Shaw Dr Maxfield Dr Shaw welcome back to our Channel Dr Lee where we talk about all things related to skin care and dermatology and today one of the biggest topics ever which is sensitive skin what is it who has it what causes it what products are best for it we're going to be talking about everything related to sensitive skincare and at the end we're going to be building you a routine with products that we recommend for sensitive skin all things sensitive skin here we go here we [Music] go so first question what on Earth is it mean does it mean to have sensitive skin the idea is that you would experience negative symptoms when the majority of other people wouldn't what that looks like is burning stinging itching irritation redness flushing after after exposure to something so that could be either just the subjective feeling of the products being uncomfortable on the skin or it can actually manifest as redness on the skin as well so why do we have sensitive skin why do some people have sensitive skin I think our poster children for this are those with eczema or atopic dermatitis and rosacea these two groups of people people who have these conditions they really struggle to use skinc care they usually struggle on a daily basis with just their Skin Barrier so this is caused by a combination of inflammation and Skin Barrier dysfunction so with atopic deritis they have a baseline levels of inflammation that are always there they have smoldering inflammation underneath the skin the Embers the coals are always hot and it just takes a little bit to push it over the edge and then it's on fire redness stinging itching the other side of it with a Skin Barrier same thing the atopic dermatitis you have decreased ceramides flagin natural moisturizing factor and so the Skin Barrier isn't healthy so not only is there always a fire but the barrier can't keep bad things out and it can't keep good things like moisture in and then you have the general population where you may not have a dedicated condition but there's probably some level of change regarding one of those two things and because a lot of it is subjective more than 50% of people think they have sensitive skin and in some studies up to 80% of people have sensitive skin it's not just hey I feel like I have sensitive skin but they've actually biopsied people's skin and looked at what changes they found in the skin so some people have thinner Skin Barrier some people have decreased ceramide and lipid contents some people have upregulation of different receptors like the tprv one receptor trpv trpv receptor this receptor is just one of many complicated neural connections that our cells talk and communicate with each other but interestingly this in particular is not only on skin cells it's on mass cells it's on multiple parts of our body and activation of this causes itch it's like really involved in the itch pathway but again it's actually also found in the rosacea pathway it's on our our C fibers our C nerve fibers which also transmit pain so this is just one cellular signaling molecule that has its little tendrils across sensitive skin everywhere and when we're looking at products that are meant for sensitive skin or to decrease that irritation or that discomfort that you feel with sensitive skin a lot of them are going to downregulate or calm down these receptors in the skin now when they've done these studies on people who have sensitive skin what they look at is basically stinging and burning when you apply lactic acid or stinging and burning in discomfort when you apply something like capsacin or even some of the more irritating surfactants like SLS right so what they look at this and see if people actually have a reaction to these that's also how they find out whether or not the products are helping to decrease that irritation inflammation and discomfort that you're feeling so if you normally feel irritation when applying lactic acid and then they apply this product and then they apply lactic acid and it decreases that irritation then that's a good sign that this product is helping with people that have sensitive skin basically like your retinol sandwich in a laboratory actually right so how do you take care of sensitive skin well there are a few things you can just simply avoid people with sensitive skin tend to react to these types of things so one would be fragrances two would be essential oils three would be drying alcohols and this is usually not causing barrier issues according to most studies but people with sensitive skin tend to react from a discomfort standpoint when they apply alcohol or drying alcohols to the skin I think I actually I know I more than he talk about products with fragrance in a positive light however my caveat is always this if you have a topic dermatitis rosacea or sensitive skin a product with fragrance is probably not for you uh my rule of thumb is it just doesn't like delete the product entirely it just you may not use it if you have sensitive skin so I think that the phrase is like say less but do less right so like you can actually do less to get an improvement in your skin with this category now when it comes to actives and sensitive skin you do have to be a little bit careful with these so you can use exfoliating acids you just need to really listen to your skin so mandelic acid larger molecule Alpha hydroxy acid may be a better exfoliator for you polyhydroxy acids like gluconolactone those are going to be better exfoliators for you but things that are smaller molecule like glycolic acid are going to tend to sting and burn in people who have sensitive skin so you may want to avoid those yeah you may not be able to use the most effective ingredient in your skincare routine retinoids included but you might be able to be consistent with a less effective one and still get great results now let's build you a routine for sensitive skin believe it or not there's actually an incredible amount of data on sensitive skin and products that help with sensitive skin so we did a deep dive on this and we actually looked for products that have these ingredients that tend to calm and Soo the skin and people who have that abnormal reaction to products so first starting out cleansers now cleansers are always going to be the most irritating part of your skincare routine they are removing dirt and debris from your skin at the same time they can be disrupting to your skin barriers so you want to look for gentle cleansers now your gentle hydr and cleansers tend to be good in this category cavey has one Cetaphil has one vany cream has one now Neutrogena has a gel foaming cleanser which is a larger molecule of surfactin in it and they've actually done studies on it that show that it decreases transepidermal water loss so if you like that foaming sensation then you can go with this Neutrogena gel foaming cleanser and still have that protected Skin Barrier I washed my face with this right before the video just because I have it right so he's like oh we got to get talk about this one it's like okay let's use it and yeah the subjective experience it was good didn't feel stripped I think Neutrogena Pink PHA cleanser um so that's a way to sneak in a light exfoliant polyhydroxy acids into your skincare routine while really minimizing the risk of irritation now again with cleansers you really just want to be gentle in this step you don't want to be taking one step forward and one step back with the rest of your products now you've picked your cleanser and you have to go onto the treatment phase now there's not a lot of good treatments for sensitive skin because you're really just trying to calm down the skin you're trying to avoid that irritation there are a few ingredients that we found while deep diving that actually do tend to offset that irritation in people that have upregulated trpv1 receptors so if you have this issue there are a few things you can do now as far as treatments and serums and moisturizers these kind of overlap into each other because a lot of the moisturizers are going to end up being treatments for people who have sensitive skin but serums that we do like would be things with the bifa ferment lysate in them now this is a probiotic um that you can find in a few products out there uh comes in serum form but has actually been shown to help with people that have sensitive skin yeah probiotics I did a huge Deep dive no one cared prob the most time I've ever done on a deep dive I cared he cared two people commented and cared but the uh nzen serum skin softening serum this is number three I was super excited that this came up I actually have fallen in love with this brand this year and last last year I actually did a live and I was like oh yeah there's this Korean skincare brand I love I don't know the name they're great this was what I was talking about but it's number three serum it has a extremely high concentration of this probiotic it's like the number one ingredient in the product list everything else is complimenting and soothing has a good amount of body subjectively I'm obsessed I think it's outstanding the poster child for this ingredient is actually the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum they're the ones that pretty much did all the studies on this ingredient showing that it helps to calm and sooe the skin and I wanted to hate that product because it it's one of those like Heritage products that's been on the market forever it's actually fragrance-free and I actually loved it when I used it the biggest Pitfall of this product is that it's super expensive it's closer to that $100 range so for me it's hard for me to always recommend it but it actually is a really nice product with actually a lot of data and they have a patented peptide that's part of this formula but but specifically it does this have this Bita of ferment extract that's been shown to be helpful for people with sensitive skin now you don't need to to use multiple serums honestly if you have sensitive skin less is more so just pick one of these another type of serum that you could look for is something with seea or cantella in it yeah the one that I've Loved this year is the seea serum from karx it is again it's the number one ingredient in multiple different forms sella Cella Cella and that's what you're wanting something very simple stripped down again for a serum has really good body I broke his rule I'm wearing both of the serums we've already talked about on my skin right now after I cleansed my face so excellent product I would even be new this year but one of my goats a high concentration of seea cantella maasti side this is going to be something that's definitely be calming and soothing for the skin now we're going to go on to just moisturizers after this but if you do want to use a hyaluronic acid serum there's good evidence to suggest that low molecular weight hyaluronic acid serums can be pro-inflammatory so they're not going to be great for people with sensitive skin you want to look for a high molecular weight hyaluronic acid product the vich mineral 89 is over 1,000 Kil adul and it's going to be the probably the best type of hyaluronic acid for sensitive skin now is this a necessary step in someone who has sensitive skin I would say no but if you did want one I would say the VC mineral 89 would be a good choice here now let's talk about my favorite category of products moisturizers when it comes to moisturizers you have different Vehicles right so like you have your gels your lotions your creams your ointments and there's now a lot of overlap so it can be difficult but what you're really wanting is something that is hydrating somewhat inclusive like whatever your preference is like some people hate the feel of something thick some people like something light that's fine just make it work another tip apply it to damp skin this is going to help lock in some more moisture it's going to help elevate your whole thing the other part of this is the individual ingredients in your moisturizers so we said no fragrance that's fine you can look for things like the sool panol dth con really is helpful but not as helpful as petrolatum and then you have individual ingredients like colloidal oatmeal and that's where I'm going to land right now this was a year of oats and it kind of I don't know if it went on noticed or not but a lot of Brands were coming out with oat products this year I was excited some of the best were aino has a good oat product it's it's actual oats it's not Cal oatmeal Cal oatmeal is regulated mad has an excellent oat balm so for someone who's looking for oats one of the most evidence-based plant ingredients in all of skincare mad balm is a great option for that sensitive skin right so this has that 5% collidal oatmeal which is actually approved for eczema proved to treat eczema it's approved as a skin protectant by the FDA so this is something that is actually clinically proven to be helpful for more of that eczema type skin now other ingredients and this is a part that I'm pretty excited about other ingredients that actually have been shown to help with sensitive skin that means the discomfort like they show people that get discomfort when they apply products and then they tried these ingredients on people to see if it actually helped with that discomfort now there are two in this category that you have probably never heard of because no one ever talks about them so first is 4T be cyclohexanol this has actually been shown to decrease sensitive skin and this is found in only a select few products but I found it in the userin redness relief line or their anti-redness line so we'll show the product here but this is super interesting this is of course a fragrance-free product but it has this ingredient that can really help Cal and suit the skin and next up is something that we talked about in our first product review ever so 3 years later we get to Circle back and talk about this product again of course this one is from L Ro POS which means that they've changed the name of it in the last three years because it wouldn't be L Ro POS if they didn't change the names on us so this used to be called the L Ro P tarian Ultra this is now called L Ro P tarian Derm allergo now this product was essentially formulated only for sensitive skin it contains an ingredient called neurosensine also known as acetal dipeptide 1 this product again has been shown to help with sensitive skin and what we love about this product and what some people hate about this product is that it's in a hermetically sealed packaging so this is airless hermetically sealed and it doesn't have any preservatives either so this is really formulated for people that get that burning stinging sensation when they apply products my wife's skin cartin is slowly coming out she has the most sensitive vascular arithat tangc ttic rosacea skin she tolerates nothing this is a staple in her routine but back when we couldn't afford this product we were like budgeting to buy this product because it was that good I remember how much it hurt to buy this product my one knock on this again name change yes also the pump I think there's been three times it just breaks like it just doesn't work and then we're left with popping it open and trying to get out what we can of this Liquid Gold um in my opinion it is a little expensive for a moisturizer for the volume um but again I think the value is there I think it's an incredibly incredibly gentle and novel unique facial moisturizer and this is a product that my wife actually uses as well she also has sensitive skin especially around her eyes lately believe it or not like me probably my fault somehow but she also loves this product so this product is incredible it's actually withed the test of time we're talking about it 3 years later which you know crazy consistency I would say we uh we keep it going so last we have to talk about sunscreen that's the protect step of your skincare routine in the morning critical cuz we do know that with sun exposure it upregulates vascular growth factors that make rosacea worse it makes sensitive skin worse it causes your barrier to be dysfunctional sunscreen critical step in your skincare routine in my patients I do find that your mineral sunscreens tend to be better for sensitive skin they cause less allergy and they cause less burning when you apply them yeah my experience as well like just because of my lifestyle sunscreens run in my eyes and I am always strictly looking for a zinc based sunscreen if I know that's going to be a problem for me right if not chemical sunscreens are fine by us a vany cream has a mineral sunscreen that is SPF 30 it's great product it Blends really really well some people might not love it but it's a great product we discovered it this year so we're actually pretty pumped about it other than that I would say if you're somebody who doesn't want to learn about all these ingredients doesn't want to learn about what to avoid just simply wants to know what skincare line do I buy if I have sensitive skin now I would say probably overall at all the brands that I looked at vany cream is probably the best formulated skincare line for sensitive skin they have the most strict ingredient guidelines when formulating products and they tend to be a safe bet I I don't think I found a vanny cream product that I don't like for sensitive skin and then second up I would say would be cavey a little less strict in their guidelines but I still also don't know of any products other than maybe their hyaluronic acid product that tends to not be great for sensitive skin yeah I think that's fair there's a reason I think dermatologists are hyper aware hyper sensitive to sensitive skin like it's the world we live in patients see us when things go wrong with their skin anytime there's a problem it's us and also there's a reason that vanac cream and cavey are always in a dermatologist pocket repertoire we can make generalizable recommendations people do need Simplicity life's crazy what's the one brand I can go look for at this store get Cy like get a Cy moisturizer you're probably going to be safe if I was not a dermatologist by training I don't know that I would know nearly anything about what to avoid in skincare products nor do I know that I would find a passion for it so so I I totally understand that people just want to know hey what do I buy I just want better skin and people want Simplicity we understand that we see it in our comments we see it in our patients um and so we totally understand the these are the two lines that I would look for again sunscreen is going to be critical to all of this the routine is going to be in the description so make sure that you download that routine people always give us really positive feedback on these handouts that we give so this is going to summarize the routine what products we recommend and what to avoid thank you all so much for tuning in please like comment and subscribe and we will see you in the next video we'll see you next time",

H: I try to think about it\u00a0\nlike does this ingredient\u00a0\u00a0 give back to my skin or does it take from it M: what are some of your\u00a0\nfavorites for calming down\u00a0\u00a0 irritated skin and supporting your skin barrier? H: panthenol glycerin and hyaluronic acid so\u00a0\nthose are hydrating panthenol's a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 soothing as well niacinamide everyone's fave\u00a0\nbut not too much like five percent not 10 or 20 and then there's barrier support so we\u00a0\nhave ceramides cholesterol or you might\u00a0\u00a0 see phytosphingosine so that's a lipid\u00a0\nyou find in the outer layer of your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and it helps to give back to your skin\u00a0\nthose lipids that it's mainly missing then we have soothing ingredients so my faves\u00a0\u00a0 are definitely oat and also centella so\u00a0\n\"cica\" madecassoside and copper peptide M: so moving on to specific products I don't know if I told you this but your\u00a0\nserum actually made me realize how there\u00a0\u00a0 were lots of actives for irritated skin because\u00a0\nI used your serum and it was lovely on my skin and then I looked at the ingredients\u00a0\nlist and there was so much stuff in there so side note I did not invite Hannah onto this\u00a0\nvideo because she's my friend and I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 plug her serum we are going to talk about other\u00a0\nproducts but this was like a revelation to me so the serum is water-based and most of the\u00a0\ntime water-based serums really sting when my\u00a0\u00a0 skin barrier is compromised and this did not\u00a0\nit just felt so lovely so my mind was blown H: I feel like the oat is doing\u00a0\na lot of the lifting there my skin was stressed out while we were\u00a0\nworking on it so it was good for me to\u00a0\u00a0 test but what I wanted was something\u00a0\nthat would feel calming on contact I definitely did feel like there was a gap\u00a0\nthat was not much you could get especially\u00a0\u00a0 in Australia that would hydrate calm and support\u00a0\nyour barrier that didn't feel like thick and balmy M: I really love how lightweight\u00a0\nit is and how well it layers and\u00a0\u00a0 like just the fact that there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market I've been using this a few times\u00a0\na week even when my skin isn't\u00a0\u00a0 that irritated because it just\u00a0\nfits into my routine so nicely M: what are your other favorite\u00a0\nproducts for when your skin's irritated? H: I really like the la roche\u00a0\nposay cicaplast sheet masks you\u00a0\u00a0 put it on your face and it just\u00a0\nfeels calm it's hydrated it's\u00a0\u00a0 the best even after treatments you\u00a0\nknow when your skin feels really hot M: so I personally just don't really enjoy sheet\u00a0\nmasks because I don't like the feeling of them\u00a0\u00a0 sliding down my face so I love the cicaplast baume\u00a0\nB5 which is getting reformulated to the B5 plus I picked up one up in Europe and so far\u00a0\nit seems to be pretty similar on my skin\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a little bit lighter but I have\u00a0\nheard different things from other people a lot of people have told me that they really\u00a0\u00a0 like the cicaplast serum as well but I\u00a0\nhaven't tried that enough to really say there are a lot of other centella products that\u00a0\nare formulated for this sort of skin recovery\u00a0\u00a0 phase as well from brands like bioderma\u00a0\nand there's quite a few in K Beauty too H: I quite like NIOD's copper\u00a0\npeptide but the lipid which is\u00a0\u00a0 a sort of gel it's great because\u00a0\nsort of a one and done PM routine Beauty Bay make this moisturizer that's oat\u00a0\u00a0 it's called Thirst Class it's kind of a\u00a0\nbit richer so I would use it in winter M: yeah I think oat is just really underrated I\u00a0\nused to make this DIY oat mask back in the day\u00a0\u00a0 that was just ground up oatmeal mixed with\u00a0\nwater and I would just slap it on my skin it has a lot of hydrating actives and\u00a0\navenanthramides which are really soothing H: if you're fancy the Cosmetics\u00a0\n27 baume 27 which is sort of like\u00a0\u00a0 a healing oil balm really beautiful it\u00a0\nhas essential oils but they're chamomile\u00a0\u00a0 calendula those calming ones not the\u00a0\nhectic lavender or anything like that laneige cream skin beautiful\u00a0\ndoesn't have many ingredients M: I really love that one too\u00a0\nit's really lightweight and\u00a0\u00a0 less ingredients just cuts down\u00a0\nthat chance of skin reactions along the same lines with less\u00a0\ningredients but a bit heavier\u00a0\u00a0 there's also Vaseline and Aquaphor\u00a0\nwhich is mostly just petroleum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 and they're water free so there's\u00a0\nlike a lot less chance of stinging there's also CeraVe healing ointment\u00a0\nand the QV sting free ointment which\u00a0\u00a0 is like the Australian version of that\u00a0\nand they both have ceramides in them too I also really like using face oils\u00a0\nwhen I have that compromised skin\u00a0\u00a0 barrier because of the lack of water\u00a0\nit just doesn't tend to sting as much H: the paula's choice advanced\u00a0\nreplenishing toner I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 reminds me of laneige cream skin only\u00a0\nit's packed with antioxidants as well\u00a0\u00a0 so it can almost be your am serum\u00a0\nif you want a bunch of antioxidants I quite like my LED mask as well so I\u00a0\nhave one that's red and near infrared I\u00a0\u00a0 find when I use it regularly my skin is just\u00a0\nmore resilient and can tolerate more things I get a little bit tired in\u00a0\nthe evening so you just put\u00a0\u00a0 it on and then you've done skincare\u00a0\nand it's one less layer on your face M: I mentioned before that you have to avoid\u00a0\nretinoids exfoliants and vitamin C but there\u00a0\u00a0 are gentler versions of those so what is your\u00a0\npolicy on using these when your skin's irritated? H: it really depends for me on how irritated my\u00a0\u00a0 skin is but but I do have some\u00a0\ngentler versions of my actives la roche C10 is an example that\u00a0\none has 10% vitamin C but also\u00a0\u00a0 their neurosensine peptide and a\u00a0\nbit of salicylic acid so I have\u00a0\u00a0 literally never had an issue with that\u00a0\nproduct and I have issues with vitamin C and if I wanted a retinoid the kiehls\u00a0\nmicrodose it's enough to have an effect\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not enough to cause any issues so\u00a0\nthat's also a perfect beginner retinoid in\u00a0\u00a0 general and it has ceramides to\u00a0\nreplenish your skin as it works M: I also really like using derivatives of\u00a0\nvitamin C and A where my skin's irritated\u00a0\u00a0 because while there is less evidence\u00a0\nfor them working they are a lot gentler which I guess could be because they're not working\u00a0\nas well but it is like a nice fallback option my favorite less irritating derivatives for\u00a0\nvitamin C are ascorbyl glucoside magnesium\u00a0\u00a0 ascorbyl phosphate and thda or\u00a0\natip which are the same thing and for vitamin A I like granactive retinoid for gentle chemical exfoliation I like\u00a0\nusing polyhydroxy acids although I do\u00a0\u00a0 also sometimes use a very small amount of\u00a0\nsalicylic acid since it can be soothing but\u00a0\u00a0 you do have to be pretty careful because\u00a0\na lot of the formulas are quite harsh M: so one question I get asked a lot is\u00a0\nhow long do you generally have to wait\u00a0\u00a0 for your barrier to fix itself before\u00a0\nyou can go back to your usual products H: I am getting pretty good at repairing mine\u00a0\u00a0 and recognizing the signs before I\u00a0\ntruly obliterate it so a week or two recently I had a facial where it was an enzyme\u00a0\nexfoliant and it was like a bit scrubby and\u00a0\u00a0 I felt a bit tingly around the mouth I\u00a0\nthought it would be fine it wasn't fine the next few days it was tingly and so I\u00a0\njust cut the actives for about two weeks previous times has taken me three months M: that is so long yeah I think it is just a lot easier to not\u00a0\nmess up your skin barrier in the first place the longest my skin has taken is probably a week\u00a0\u00a0 or two but it depends a lot\u00a0\non the type of irritation so with perioral dermatitis\u00a0\nusually that is maybe a day or two if my nose is peeling off after a cold\u00a0\nthen that will usually be over a week now with cleansers which ones\u00a0\ndo you like for irritated skin? H: I like to use fragrance free cleanses and\u00a0\nit's because if your barrier is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 compromised then things get in further and so\u00a0\nthey wouldn't normally irritate you but they can I like avene extremely gentle cleanser\u00a0\nI like biologique recherche lait u that\u00a0\u00a0 is the one that's for oily skin but it's a cream and I like a really soft washcloth so like\u00a0\nthat really flammable fluffy polyester M: I also like fragrance free\u00a0\ncleansers where my skin's irritated some of my favorites are from geek\u00a0\nand gorgeous hada labo and bondi sands all of those don't really strip\u00a0\nskin and like you said they have\u00a0\u00a0 moisturising ingredients\u00a0\nthat give back to the skin I also really like using bioderma micellar\u00a0\nwater with soft reusable cotton rounds the bioderma was specifically designed and tested\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin and reusable\u00a0\ncotton rounds are just really soft M: now we are Australians so of course\u00a0\nwe have to talk about sun protection what is your approach when your skin's irritated? H: there are a couple of sunscreens\u00a0\nI know not to use because I can feel\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit spicy on the cheeks if my\u00a0\nskin is irritated but generally I will\u00a0\u00a0 look for one that is formulated for sensitive skin I really like those European pharmacy\u00a0\nbrands ends that cater to this type of skin M: yeah I think there is this sort of\u00a0\nassumption that you have to use zinc\u00a0\u00a0 oxide if your skin's irritated but\u00a0\nsometimes that's not the best option\u00a0\u00a0 and newer sunscreen filters\u00a0\ncan be really non-irritating if you go into like a French pharmacy\u00a0\nyou'll see that all of their sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin sunscreens are actually all chemical\u00a0\nsunscreens they have those newer filters some people actually find zinc oxide\u00a0\nmore irritating because it is drying\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite irritating when you're\u00a0\nrubbing it in because it's so thick\u00a0\u00a0 and sticky and also just trying to\u00a0\nget it off with cleanser at the end on top of that they're not always truly free\u00a0\nfrom chemical sunscreens I've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this before but there are these SPF boosters\u00a0\nthat are in a lot of mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\u00a0 they have almost identical properties to a\u00a0\nlot of properly approved chemical sunscreens I've actually talked to quite a few\u00a0\npeople now who have told me that they\u00a0\u00a0 react to some mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\nnot others and then they checked and\u00a0\u00a0 they saw that the ones that they do\u00a0\nreact to have butyloctyl salicylate M: right what other tips and tricks\u00a0\ndo you have for irritated skin? H: I think a lot of people don't know\u00a0\nthat your skin it exfoliates itself right it's called desquamation and it does that\u00a0\nbetter when it is adequately hydrated so\u00a0\u00a0 I would always try to hydrate my\u00a0\nskin before I try to exfoliate it if it's flaking or something\u00a0\nlike that and you might find\u00a0\u00a0 that the flakes take care of themselves that way I also really like doing several\u00a0\nlayers of one toner putting several\u00a0\u00a0 layers of one product on is better\u00a0\nthan putting four or five different\u00a0\u00a0 products right less opportunity\u00a0\nto upset your skin freak it out M: I also find that with flaky skin\u00a0\nif I have to get rid of them before\u00a0\u00a0 putting on makeup then I will wet my\u00a0\nskin and use a peeling gel very very\u00a0\u00a0 carefully and just buff in tiny circles\u00a0\nand that seems to do the least damage but that is like a really emergency sort\u00a0\nof thing I wouldn't recommend doing that\u00a0\u00a0 regularly when your skin is compromised because\u00a0\nthe hydration technique is just so much safer M: you also gave me some really good tips for\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis which is a newer issue for me it's a red rash that comes up around\u00a0\nyour mouth and near the sides of your\u00a0\u00a0 nose and it's been coming up\u00a0\nmore because of mask wearing the extra humidity can lead to an impaired barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and imbalance microbes and that can\u00a0\ncontribute to perioral dermatitis so I've had to change a few things when it flares\u00a0\u00a0 up like adding a cleanser in the\u00a0\nmorning which I don't usually do when my skin is happy then extra\u00a0\ncleansing tends to mess it up more\u00a0\u00a0 and dehydrate my skin but when that\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis is flaring then\u00a0\u00a0 my skin's already messed up so cleansing\u00a0\nactually takes it back towards happy M: do you have any other tips? H: if you think it might be perioral\u00a0\ndermatitis never put steroids on it\u00a0\u00a0 that's a Dr Cara-ism it's my beloved dermatologist perioral dermatitis it's like imbalanced\u00a0\nmicrobiome but also it can happen from\u00a0\u00a0 steroid withdrawal because the steroids\u00a0\nput your immune system to sleep a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit your immune system was there sort\u00a0\nof keeping the microbiome in check M: speaking of microbiome I found that I\u00a0\nsometimes get very superficial folliculitis\u00a0\u00a0 on my body when my skin gets irritated\u00a0\nso like after exercising and I'm sweaty\u00a0\u00a0 and my clothes have been rubbing in my\u00a0\narmpits and in like my crotchal region and it's usually worse when I'm a bit\u00a0\nrun down from stress and lack of sleep basically this is when bacteria infect your hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles and you get red bumps with pus\u00a0\nthat look like shallow inflamed pimples for these I like to use a benzoyl\u00a0\nperoxide cleanser most of these are\u00a0\u00a0 meant for the face but dermatologists have been\u00a0\u00a0 recommending it for body folliculitis too\u00a0\nand it's been working really well for me I use it right after I exercise\u00a0\nand also when I'm having a flare\u00a0\u00a0 and just also not marinating\u00a0\nin sweaty clothes helps a lot but if it's really deep and painful\u00a0\nand not going away then definitely see\u00a0\u00a0 a doctor because you might need antibiotics or\u00a0\nsomething or it could be just not folliculitis M: now rosacea I get asked about this a lot and\u00a0\u00a0 it's a bit of a confusing condition\u00a0\nthat not a lot of people talk about so what is rosacea? H: rosacea is a chronic inflammatory\u00a0\nskin condition it's basically my\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist explained it to me as it's the blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels that are inflamed not the\u00a0\npores like you would have in acne you'll see visible blood vessels so those\u00a0\nlittle red ones are called telangiectasias\u00a0\u00a0 redness flushing so you'll see a symmetrical\u00a0\npattern of redness so mine comes and goes so you might get sort of a pimple like bump but it\u00a0\u00a0 won't be in the t-zone it will be around\u00a0\nthe cheeks and the nose in this pattern so it's like w zone not t-zone M: it gets confused a lot with acne and it\u00a0\ntends to show up from your late 20s onwards M: so how did you first\u00a0\nsuspect that you had rosacea? H: I was at an event and Dr Dennis\u00a0\nwas there and I said \"you know what\u00a0\u00a0 I'm always like flushing pink and red\u00a0\nthrough here sometimes through my cheeks what's going on? is that something I can treat?\" he's like \"well that's rosacea\" and I\u00a0\nwas like \"see ya\" I didn't want to know M: why should you actually\u00a0\nlook into managing rosacea? H: the thing about rosacea is that it progresses so you'll start with just the pink\u00a0\nand the flushing and maybe some\u00a0\u00a0 visible blood vessels around the nose\u00a0\nyou can get them in your cheeks too and then you'll start to get lesions\u00a0\nand you can also have it get into your\u00a0\u00a0 eyes and then it can progress\u00a0\nto thickened skin and swelling M: in terms of treating rosacea there\u00a0\nare over-the-counter options like\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid you should also\u00a0\nsee a dermatologist who has\u00a0\u00a0 experience with treating rosacea and\u00a0\nthey'll have other options available how else do you manage rosacea? H: Keeping on top of your skin barrier\u00a0\nand keeping that in check in place,\u00a0\u00a0 really supporting it is number one And avoiding triggers so you'll notice\u00a0\nwhen you start to flush from certain things the sun is a big one my skin hates the indoor heating - hates it alcohol some foods even spicy food is a big one\u00a0\u00a0 especially for like pale people\u00a0\nthat only eat meat and vegetables some medicines even do it your\u00a0\nskin care or makeup could do it M: I feel like in the skincare community we\u00a0\ntalk so much about acne but nowhere near as\u00a0\u00a0 much about rosacea so if any of this is\u00a0\nsounding familiar then you might want\u00a0\u00a0 to read up a bit on rosacea and\u00a0\nconsider getting it checked out I'll put some more resources in the\u00a0\ncaption and keep in mind that if you\u00a0\u00a0 have darker skin the redness will be harder to see I hope you enjoyed this nerdy chat if you did like the video to train the YouTube\u00a0\nalgorithm to give you more content like this also share any tips you have and leave\u00a0\nquestions for Hannah in the comments you can follow Hannah here she's also\u00a0\nwritten a great book and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 how much I'm getting out of it from all of my tabs I also have an ebook on skincare and I hope\u00a0\nthis video helps your skin be less grumpy at you",

        "published_at": "2021-01-24T21:58:21Z",
        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "you're in your 30s and you're deciding what are you going to do with your skin maybe this is your first introduction into skincare or maybe you've had a routine throughout your 20s and now you're trying to figure out how to transition into your 30s so this is our skincare routine for your 30s video right and sorry to disappoint you but 30s can be rough you're not going to leave like your entire youth behind but it's going to start to show and we're going to help equip you for the changes that are occurring or about I feel like I'm starting a puberty video but like we're going to equip you for the changes that are going on in your skin during your 30s all things 30s skincare here we go here we go Dr Maxfield and I are both in hour now later 30s mid 30s mid on the way up to late and we have noticed some of these changes in fact if you look back at our older videos when we are early 30s you actually kind of see time and stress hitting us in a very accelerated way so we empathize with all of you um some of the changes that you may be going through or experiencing with your skin let's talk about some of the changes that pretty consistently happen to people's skin when they turn 30 and go from the 30s into the 40s now there's this sort of concept that your birthday turns to 30 and then suddenly like your collagen production slows down and you know your skin cells turn over slower it's not like the next day it's not like there's a clock that goes off and it's it's just just a gradual progression that this happens at but you start to notice these changes usually in your 30s right it's true and I think the science like the first time I heard this was an undergraduate but basically our skin cells sto becoming new like our cells and our whole body sto becoming new and growing new cells and they just kind of hang on for dear life and slowly wear down that occurs like maybe in our mid 20s but it all starts showing up in our 30s so what this looks like just from an aging perspective is that the dark spots the texture the fine lines all of that starts to become present and starts to become permanent and prominent in addition we also start to develop rosacea this is something else that peaks in about the 30s and then continues to start now the one good news if there is any is that for some of us acne is going to disappear like your traditional acne starts to fade away or probably has faded away by the time you're 30 on the flip side you may be one of those unlucky people who now have just suddenly started to experience what we call hormonal acne which all acne is hormonal but this is the traditional what everyone refers to is hormonal acne and I actually have a lot of patients that come into the office and they say I never had acne throughout my entire life as soon as I turned 30s I started to break out along my jawline this is also very common in this age group so we're going to try to figure out how to address all these different types of concerns but you may need to start altering your skincare routine and start actually targeting some of these issues all right so what are some things that you started to experience with your skin at 30 and Beyond this is very interesting you ask that so definitely fine lines and wrinkles like it got to a point we do videos we look at ourselves all the time and I started realizing I was like my goodness my forehead it's just like line upon line upon line upon line and that just wasn't the case before like good or bad it just wasn't the case before and then same thing with dark spots I noticed I was getting a lot of dark spots you know what actually we didn't talk about this well we did but it pores like there was a time where Dr was like dude your pores and your nose is like out of control and so like changed my routine change some things about that well I didn't say all that I no you said all no I said you were developing Rosia and we needed to reach you before you developed ropa is what I said be specific apples and oranges like that's what I got from it basically but that's a part of rosacea right so we did mention rosacea that's one of the four types ocular uh acneform vascular and then Fus and the oil Grand rosacea so I I've experienced again dark spots lines and rosacea most prominently I would say texture for me like just growths in general like milia skin tags large oil called sebaceous hyperplasia I also started to experienc fine lines and wrinkles other things in general white hair um yeah that's true harder to lose weight that's unrelated to skincare hair loss right so these are all things that I I didn't have in my 20s and now have acquired in my 30s we could talk a little bit about even like what we do in our routines um to Target some of these issues when these things start to show up it's a little bit of like negative feedback it's like a slap on the wrist when you do something bad and so candidly my son protection has gotten a lot better over the last 6 Years cuz I'm still in my mid-30s I'm very I'm religious with it I like don't miss it ever when I'm outside I'll be going to surf and I will turn around and go get my sunscreen before I go back out to Surf it's that important to me and it's made a huge difference for oil I do a lot of ingredients for oil control um Incorporated everything for that white hairs of just like Let It Go what are you going to do at this point for white hairs I don't do anything for that yet I am allergic to hair dye so so um so there's not much I can do anymore there's like semi-permanent hair dyes and stuff but and there's like this whole discussion of like can you reverse Grays probably not um but like there is some new data coming out that certain like things can help but we're not like quite there with like a complete solution to that so just in general some of these things are like untargetable right but I've adopted a hair loss routine and I've adopted essentially like a quote unquote anti-aging or healthy aging routine um in order to combat a lot of the issues I'm just experiencing with time and so like Dr Maxfield said sunscreen has become so critical to my routine getting Botox once a year um is a big thing for me most people that get BOTOX get it every 3 months but for me I get it once a year because I want to avoid the lines but I also don't want to have like no movement cuz I like to express my face and I'm the same way it's like botox once a year it's not super deliberate it just happens like I just fall into a Botox needle you know how that happens the other thing too yeah life is like the diet exercise thing I've improved my my diet I've slipping back but I exercise habitually and have for like 17 years now like I just never miss exercise I'm also have gotten a personal trainer recently due to my lack of own willpower um trying to work through that um maybe I'll share some of that stuff with you all on Instagram if you're following along let's talk about specifically targeting some of these issues that you may start developing again this is where you definitely need to start introducing sunscreen in your routine this is going to be for everybody sort of UN Al across the board your skin is just less giving at this time right I developed sort of this mask of redness um rosacea more of like the platic type of rosacea that occurs in the mid face I develop that and anytime that I don't wear sunscreen that flares you'll notice more redness on my cheeks your skin just cannot rebound as easily as it once did your skin cells are slowly turning over and so retinol is an ingredient that can speed up that skin cell turnover you're may be developing dark spots and so again retinol is something that can block tyrosinase block the transfer of pigment and also remove pigment that's deposited in the skin if you're developing milia because of occlusives or just your skin cells aren't turning over as quickly retinol is something that can help to prevent Mila and texture on the skin and so the first thing that I started to introduce in my 30s was actually retinol and that's like a perfect segue into like all the ingredients and what you should be doing for the treatment of your skin at this time in your life and I think that's the right move one is sunscreen I'm I'm telling you we're going to Benchmark this moment and then 30 years from now let all go back and watch this video from our spaceships because like sunscreen is going to pay dividends like this is the equity you're putting in now for you to pull from that equity in your 50s and 60s it's a huge difference the second thing being retinoids you can introduce one ingredient sure Treo one this is a staple ingredient that covers all the things aging dark spots texture collagen last and and it's something that you can use your entire life it's better the longer you use it so start now because we're huge fans of deliberate skincare it's a little challenging for us to build a routine for each of you because your issues in your 30 can vary vastly from one person to the next uh but we'll try to Target the common concerns and give you either one ingredient or one product that could Target that concern uh for your treat step of the routine so to start off gentle cleanser is always going to be consistent across the board so we always do cleanse treat protect so at night let's start cuz I always start with the night routine cleanser uh just a gentle cleanser this is again if you're wearing makeup if you're wearing water resistant sunscreens your skin is less forgiving in your 30s um just telling you this from personal experience it's just less forgiving like when I forget to remove my sunscreen at night in the morning I feel like my pores are clogged I can see it I can actually see buildup of sebaceous filaments in my nose when I don't remove my sunscreen so again like your skin isn't as resilient so this is where you're going to definitely want to maybe potentially start introducing even double cleansing in your routine that's using a cleansing oil or a cleansing bomb we both like the pharmacy cleansing bomb um I like the DHC cleansing oil you like the Dermatology cleansing oil um also though I will say like just a oilbased cleanser here is like a really nice way to do it Sashi states of skin is one I've been obsessed with lately I don't personally love oilbased cleansers but this one for whatever reason I'm like obsessed with minimal lather oilbased remove your sunscreen and makeup now here's actually where a cleanser can become important like functionally important and this is the introduction of sulfur a hero ingredient that gets no love not because it smells that that can't be it can't be it at all it just doesn't get the love it deserves for me the prescription sulfur ingredient the sulfur sulfacetamide combination is by far the most effective the most aesthetic the least smelly and honestly it's less expensive than any over-the-counter counterpart so I hate to propose like a prescription option but that by far is my favorite conversely you have like a Kate Somerville sulfur cleanser which is kind of Classic this ingredient can be wonderful for especially Ros the acne form of rosace in particular which is again hitting this age group so again you could be even targeted with your cleansing part of the routine you can introduce cleansers that have mild exfoliants in them like polyhydroxy acid or mandelic acid or glycolic acid again sodium sulfacetamide you can also introduce like a Benzel peroxide for an acne but regardless you can be very targeted with this step and sulfur if you're developing rosacea is a really really excellent ingredient in some cases it's over promising under delivering people are swearing that it can like eliminate pores there's no evidence that sulfur eliminates pores by any means great for rosacea incredible incredible ingredient for rosacea next I would say for treating at night again very deliberate if you have acne differ in gel or trano and a retinoid in general different is the over-the-counter one just go with that if you have rosacea overthe counter you're kind of limited AIC acid would be my go to option you can get the one from Niche Beauty Labs that's a 15% AIC acid overthe coun I don't even know if it's legal if you're not able to get the theid AIC acid there's the ordinary at 10% there's Paul's choice at 10% theorum has a 10% but they have a 15% which is like prescription level I don't even know how they're doing it and then let's see what other conditions dark spots yeah dark spots but just before we go to dark spots since we're focusing on hormonal acne for this age group I have to shout out a prescription option again I feel like I'm like in the doctor's office talking to you now but win Levy this is a topical anti-androgen so it's going to like blunt the hor hormonal response to your hormonal acne and the reason I think it's important is just it's Unique there's nothing else that's doing what it does right now and so that can be a very effective ingredient especially for that hormonal component especially again along the jawline male and female guys and girls you can all use this ingredient now to dark spots we talked about troan retinoids being the anchor but here's where you can introduce your like skin malist Consolidated product may love fadeaway serum the Dr Shaw dark spot Dynamic delicious ser serum of love what is the name of this product it's called remedy for dark spots it's called it's the easiest name of all I actually deliberately chose the easiest name for the product you can remember the may love fadeaway serum but you can't remember remedy for dark spots it's just so functional I thought that couldn't possibly be it I'm a functional person that one includes your retinoid it also includes 11 which is absurd 11 supporting ingredients like it's a one-step shop for your dark spots but again ingredients you're looking for if you want to break it down by ingredient you want your transic acid you want your Alpha abutin you want your gluconolactone you want your coic acid niinomi I mean it's an extensive exhausting list that's why I like consolidated products for this right exactly one product here targeting some of the dark spots in discoloration that you either got from your acne uh your post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or a lot of my friends developed melasma in their 30s combined products are really effective faded is another option that we've been big fans of um some people don't like the sulfur smell of the product because it smells like rotten eggs but some people don't mind the smell at all and then another thing that I personally experienced in my 30s like I said is texture the first thing that I did when I developed texture was I introduced a retinoid into my skin care routine and I I blitzed it every night got irritated you can watch some of our old videos on how that process looked I look like such a a little kid back then I got really irritated but I eventually powered through it cuz you will get retinoid dermatitis or irritation when you initially start your retinoid and if you're in your 30s and you're starting it For the First Time start every other night until your skin gets used to it my texture on my skin got about 80% better from just the retinoid alone and then I wanted to really kind of break through to get that shine it was very I was very focused on getting the glow this dewy skin that I was seeking in life and I introduced a chemical exfoliant twice a week right so I would do retinoid three nights exfoliant retinoid three nights exfoliant 31 31313 and that broke me to that like 90% cuz otherwise it just wasn't breaking through with retinoid alone and so I introduced a lactic acid exfoliant into my routine and if you're looking to to treat texture retinoid five six nights a week five or six nights a week an exfoliant for your skin type once or twice a week and we'll link below how to pick an exfoliant for your skin type a link above how to pick an exfoliant for your skin type um because you should be deliberate about which type of exfoliant you're going to choose right and honestly that in my opinion is sufficient for texture at this time of your life we will talk more about this later as we like move back in time or forward in time with life routines cuz that's coming by the way this is just like the beginning of a life Journey um but that probably is sufficient right now for your skin and the last part of this treat thing is and this is always like a little bit of a taboo topic but again being very deliberate about why you're doing things when I started turning kind of mid-30s I started to really develop bags under my eyes dark circles I was traveling a lot or am still traveling a lot always just kind of like looking tired and noticing noticing my age and fatigue mostly in my eyes so this is when I started to introduce more of an eye cream into my skincare routine I don't think eye creams are Miracles by any means but I do think they can help with some of the puffiness and dark circles they can brighten the under eye area so I've always been a big fan of the L'Oreal Paris caffeine and hyaluronic acid eye serum there's also other options biossance is still my number one favorite eye cream Marine Al I just think it's incredible I don't know why and then at night it's just simply again a moisturizer a moisturizer based on your skin type dry skin thick cream oily skin gel normal skin you can go either way yeah exactly just moisturize or not but do it to your preference for your skin type very subjective goal here like it's very subjective if you want to great if you don't want to great if your skin likes this great if it doesn't like this great it's all up to you and then your night is closed then you go to bed this is again whatever amount of sleep you get congratulations You' fallen asleep and woken up now it's the daytime and our morning routine so morning routine you know a lot of people say you don't need to cleanse twice I cleanse twice a day um I just use a gentle cleanser that doesn't Strip My Skin Barrier otherwise I look really oily in the morning if I don't um and I have all these actives on my my skin over so I personally like to cleanse the second time in the morning so I use the same gentle cleanser that I was personally using at night I also cleanse in the morning mostly because I work out in the morning and I want to wash before I go to work so I do that again don't stress it just whatever wash you want is fine here so treat here is again based off of your specific skin goals I won't belabor the points because we've kind of talked about a lot of these ingredients already for dark spots here you can use a vitamin C you can use supporting antioxidants to complement the vitamin C and then your sunscreen Additionally you can find a leave on sulfur product I think it's Neutrogena has a nice leave on sulfur product one of the very few so for rosacea that's a good option to compliment what you're doing there and then that basically takes you to perhaps the foundational part which is protection and of course this is sunscreen everyone should be using sunscreen this is the years it's going to matter the most you're actually going to notice a difference a noticeable difference in the quality of your skin when you don't wear sunscreen even in within one day I personally I don't know if you notice it but if I don't wear sunscreen for a day I notice more redness I notice more just inflammation I I notice even more like texture to my skin it's like it's a weird thing but I do notice the difference and maybe because I live parttime in Miami now so I get a lot of sun exposure otherwise and it's very noticeable on my skin so sunscreen very very critical find one that you love you may want to look into more sophisticated sunscreens at this age you know you're leaving your 20s you're entering your 30s maybe you want something that is going to double as almost a foundation dupe in a way as Dr mfi puts it I still believe right you're in your 30s I'm in my 30s I still believe that the Alta MD UV restore tinted it just makes my skin look better like I put it on and I'm like yeah that's it it's cuz you're wearing makeup it's like sunscreen but it really does actually function for that no makeup makeup look because it's kind of forgiving like if you've ever worn tinted sunscreen like it graciously Blends it kind of blurs what you want it to blur it has that dual purpose of protecting and it's subtle so I I do think tinted sunscreen is great for that but whatever sunscreen you prefer again for your skin type you're going to have to try them you're going to have to see which ones you like chemical or mineral totally your preference but you really need to invest the time into building this cuz this is like the next 30 40 Years of your life are going to hinge on that one step and if you make the change now in your 30s it'll be noticeable in your 40s or 50s your 60s or 70s or 80s I think it will make a big difference now if you look at our analytics on YouTube the biggest Peak is actually 30 to 40 so U many of you are sort of Aging with us um and so we'll share some of the things that we do maybe we'll even talk about some of the procedures we either have done or are considering doing ourselves um so that you can kind of make those decisions with us whether you want to do those things or not and you can actually see the results of those procedures but anyway that wraps it up you have everything from cleanse treat protect for all of the nuanced changes for your skin in your 30s and don't fear aging Don't Fear the wrinkle don't fear a white hair it's all part of the normal part of aging and this is where you're going to start to actually notice it and how how much you want to do to prevent that and how much you want to just do nothing to prevent that is going to be up to you as an individual you'll see a lot of your friends start to get fillers and Botox and Laser procedures and even plastic surgery at this age and you'll wonder like should I do these things too and like you really need to decide like what you want to do for yourself we can't tell you we could tell you that him and I we kind of like a more natural look um we try to describe to our patients like a more natural healthier way of Aging but like I still have patients that come in that want a little bit more extreme outcomes ultimately you have to decide like what type of outcome you want and this is the sort of formative years where you're going to be choosing how far how extreme how unext reme you want to go but as long as you're wearing sunscreen you're still going to be so much better off than most people and just skincare alone will get you far ahead of the game I don't know that's such a good summation I don't want to step on it perfect like be deliberate be you enjoy this journey of life we're just here to equip you with the tools and information so you can make deliberate decisions that is all so we'll see you all in the next video please like comment and

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "let me guys get excited because this video is a long time coming I feel like it's been over a year since I did a tips for rosacea today's video I'm going to share with you guys dermatologist tips for navigating skincare choosing skincare and thanks to avoid and skincare products for people with rosacea one of my favorite skincare products for people with rosacea you guys know is Rosa care and I'm partnering with procure the maker of Rosa care on today's video so I'll talk a little bit more later in today's video on why this is a fantastic product for people with rosacea in their skincare routine if you have rosacea you already know what a challenge it can be to navigate the skincare aisle and select skincare products that do not irritate you staying burn cause excessive redness and irritation on your skin rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by hypersensitivity to things that come in contact with the skin and that hypersensitivity manifests with symptoms such as burning tingling flushes of redness heat and little red bumps that almost look like acne and pimples but are a little different in their underlying nature rosacea is an incredibly uncomfortable disease to live with so my number one tip for rosacea skin care and navigating rosacea skin care products is keep it simple keep it simple in that your routine and the products you use should not be excessive there should not be more than three products think about it rosacea is a skin disease in which things that come in contact with the skin are very likely to irritate you so reduce the number of things that you put on your skin that is my number one tip basic tenets of a skincare routine really for anybody but in particular for people with rosacea should just be three products a gentle cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen and I'll get into the details and nuances of those in a moment so that leads me into my next tip and that is cleansing your skin it is important to cleanse your skin and to select a gentle cleanser a non soap cleanser I have several videos talking about some of my favorite gentle cleansers for the face so I'll list those videos down below for you to check out things that come in contact with the skin from your environment so on the skin and can contribute to you prolonged symptoms and exacerbation of redness and irritation the way you cleanse your skin out is very important you need to do so in a gentle manner just use lukewarm water want to avoid extremes of temperature and just use your finger pads in a circular motion across the face cleansing your skin this way is important for everybody but in particular for people with rosacea because physical physical touch physical factors can also flare redness irritation and precipitate flares of your disease in other words things like spin brushes scrub brushes facial brush those harsh washcloths can be your nemesis so just use your finger pads in a gentle circular motion and then rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water my third tip is to use a moisturizer on a daily basis whether your skin is dry or oily you still really need to moisturize moisturizers hydrate the skin by trapping water onto the surface of the skin and sealing it there in place they also condition the skin cells smooth the skin cells and calm down inflammation for people with rosacea using a moisturizer is really important also because we know that in individuals who use a moisturizer along with their rosacea medications they have a better outcome to their treatment than if they don't use a moisturizer and the reason using a moisturizer is so important is that it helps just you the skin hydrate the skin reduce the likelihood of irritation and the way to apply it is to use it immediately after cleansing to damp skin so once you rinse off your cleanser in the face is still wet that is when you want to apply your moisturizer and the reason for this is that it capitalizes on the hydration status of your skin at the time of cleansing just as you wet the skin to remove that cleanser there's a lot of water on your skin so moisturizer with its ingredients will come on and we'll lock that water in place and really helped you drive hydration into your skin and see the skin and reduce irritations and doing so will reduce the severity of rosacea and we have several studies showing can improve your treatment outcomes with your prescription topical and oral medicaid rosacea medications it's a really important part of rosacea skin care now my fourth tip will come as no surprise to you all because I talked about it and any chance I get I will bring it up and that is to protect your skin from the Sun wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen rosacea patients have a challenge however in finding a sunscreen that will protect their skin without simultaneously irritating the rosacea so some tips for selecting a sunscreen are to select a physical sunscreen and what that means is that when you look at the active ingredients of the sunscreen it should say zinc oxide only or it should say zinc and titanium dioxide those should be the active ingredients these active ingredients are most well tolerated or people with rosacea they are not irritating they do not sting they do not burn on the other hand other ingredients in sunscreens that are chemical ingredients chemical filters things like oxybenzone Ava Ben's own chakra line these ingredients can really be irritating for people with rosacea these ingredients can cause a little bit of irritation to this these types and precipitate a flare so it's best to select a mineral only physical sunscreen and by that again I mean one whose active ingredient is either zinc only or the active ingredients zinc plus titanium dioxide those are most well tolerated and the sunscreen also should be labeled broad-spectrum and it should be an SPF a sun protective factor of 30 or higher in order to properly protect your skin sunscreen needs to be applied on a daily basis even when it's cloudy out this is because the ultraviolet radiation that comes from the Sun can come through the clouds it can come through your windows and can contribute to the inflammation in your skin and drive your rosacea so you need to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen on a daily basis some other tips the over choosing your sunscreen is make sure it does it's fragrance free fragrance as I'll get into later is a it can really be problematic for people with rosacea to make sure it's fragrance free look for ingredients like silicones silicones go by the name dimethicone and a few other names all lists down below for you guys to help navigate but silicones are well tolerated in moisturizers and sunscreens for people with rosacea there they tend to be lightweight they are oil-free and therefore are comfortable for people with rosacea hyaluronic acid is a humectant that will frequently be included not only in moisturizers but also in sunscreens and is also well tolerated in people with rosacea helps to hydrate the skin and in a sunscreen can really helped you combat some of the dryness that you might experience with using a mineral sunscreen they can be a little drying so those are some good ingredients to look for and some good features to look for in choosing a sunscreen check out my videos on my protection mineral sunscreens I reviewed several and again I'll list the video that I'm talking about it down below in the description box to make it easy for you guys so my this set of tips pertains to ingredients what to look for what to exclude the number one thing that you should excluding from your skincare products is fragrance I always encourage everybody to make every effort to exclude fragrance from their products to only select fragrance free products but in particular people with rosacea have to do this and the reason is twofold people with rosacea have a higher likelihood of developing something called allergic contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis happens when you become sensitized against an ingredient and then you develop a skin allergy every time you come in contact with it so they have a higher likelihood of developing an allergy to fragrance in their products and people with rosacea are also more likely to have flares of their symptoms regardless of allergy when they come in contact with fragrance why is that so well the reason is because fragrance compounds can function not only as irritants on the skin and drive inflammation but they're also things called vasodilators vasodilators make the blood vessels in her skin to dilate and bring more redness into the skin which is the opposite of what you want to do in rosacea so selecting products that are fragrance free is really important selecting a product oh it's fragrance free it's tricky to navigate because you might be duped into thinking that a product labelled unscented is safe unscented is not fragrance free when you read unscented be very careful because unscented often means the product contains fragrance and it contains a masking fragrance to hide the scent of the product so that you don't detect it with your nose but it's still there and fragrance goes by a lot of names so I will list these names down below in the description box for you guys so you know what to look for because manufacturers are not really required to disclose the inclusion of fragrance in their products I'll list those names down below for you guys so you know what or in addition to fragrance the other ingredient that you want to avoid it's kind of very similar to pregnancy is any type of essential oils lavender oil rose oil rubs hip oil any type of essential oil regardless of how it was processed and made can contain things like fragrance ingredients that while you may not detect them with your nose while they may not have an aroma to them they can still irritate and bother the skin of rosacea so avoiding products with essential oils is really important the other ingredient to avoid is the inclusion of alcohols in your skin hair products alcohols are frequently present in a lot of sunscreen will often have alcohol so you've got to look for that ingredient alcohol is also added to stabilize active ingredients in sunscreens so it's in a lot of sunscreens and for people in general you know alcohol and alcohol Danitra they're not it's not a bad ingredient it's not something to fear but for people with rosacea it definitely is something that can contribute to a flare of their disease and irritate their skin simply because it is more on the drying side and people with rosacea just don't tolerate that to the same degree as other skin types and other people with without rosacea so avoid avoid alcohol and then menthol menthol is something that has to be avoided you'll find men fell on a lot of face washes and it imparts a tingling sensation you don't want a tingles and rosacea and some other ingredients in that vein that are often out it includes things like peppermint as well which is added to make things tingle and then witch hazel I have videos talking about witch hazel and you know it can be irritating and it really can be irritating for people with rosacea the other ingredient to avoid is eucalyptus eucalyptus is frequently added as a preservative to products and but it has been reported as something that is really aggravating to people with rosacea there are some beneficial botanic ingredient so in rosacea and for rosacea care one of which includes niacinamide niacinamide is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for redness it can it can reduce the amount of redness and it also can help your skin barrier in healing and keep your skin hydrated so it is a good ingredient ceramides are also a good ingredient to consider or rosacea they are natural part of our natural lipid barrier and in moisturizers can help our skin barrier and then also licorice root extract is very helpful in rosacea skin care products because it like niacinamide can be calming out anti redness you will find licorice root in a variety of products that are labeled anti redness and kind of targeting people with rosacea so that is a good ingredient from a cosmetic perspective another ingredient to look for property in a product you look for is chromium or color correction with a green tint this helps to camouflage redness and even out skin tone very nicely the reason I like this product is they is specifically formulated for people with rosacea and they they have not included any of the common rosacea irritants there's no menthol there's no eucalyptus there's no fragrance so all the stuff I told you to avoid is not in this this contains good ingredients for rosacea including niacinamide which as I said is anti-inflammatory helpful for the skin barrier it also includes licorice root which is anti redness and thirdly it contains the color correcting chromium property so it can nicely helped you even out skin tone without masking things so it's not like a makeup or a cosmetic it simply helps to even out skin tone through that chromium these ingredients are evidence-based for rosacea so the formulation combines the wisdom of nature with the power of science to really deliver an effect product for our rosacea sufferers that takes the guesswork out of ingredients and navigating ingredient lists and in addition to those beneficial rosacea ingredients that I mentioned niacinamide licorice root extract and color correct and chromium this also is a nice rosacea friendly moisturizer in that it's got hyaluronic acid which is hydrating helps to hold on water into the skin as a humectant and has dimethicone and silicone ingredients which helped you seal in water into the skin and trap water there and prevent what's called trans epidermal water loss from the skin that could lead to dryness so this is a really nice lightweight and comfortable moisturizer to wear for people with rosacea or really honestly if you have redness in general it's also very good this product is oil-free it's not going to exacerbate and the acne clog pores it's non-comedogenic and I'm really comfortable to wear the way to use this is as a moisturizer to apply it immediately active cleansing your face to damp skin and allow it to dry you can apply it in the evening time after cleansing and then again in the morning after cleansing after after cleansing and applying this allow it to dry and then put your sunscreen on over for morning use I can buy it on amazon.com as well at CVS anyways guys that concludes the tips check the description box I will list the key features that I mentioned in today's video I hope it was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

journey i'm going to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 skin condition which i have been suffering from\u00a0\nlast 15 years which is called rojasia i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to divide this video into different categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there lastly\u00a0\nbefore i go i want to say please be kind to others\u00a0\u00a0 be considerate to people who are suffering from\u00a0\nskin condition before you ask someone about their\u00a0\u00a0 face please think how you would feel if you were\u00a0\nin their shoes i feel like social media is also\u00a0\u00a0 to blame so we are conditioned to think everybody\u00a0\nneeds to have a beautiful skin you always see\u00a0\u00a0 like edited pictures flawless skin clear skin\u00a0\nin real life we have pores we have breakouts\u00a0\u00a0 we have pigmentation nobody has that porcelain\u00a0\nskin or baby like skin still today even though\u00a0\u00a0 i have a clear skin i don't have like a perfect\u00a0\nskin i feel like it is so important to normalize\u00a0\u00a0 skin conditions we need to have open dialogue\u00a0\nand open conversation in social media that is\u00a0\u00a0 how i feel anybody suffering with skin\u00a0\ncondition acne pigmentation or any sort\u00a0\u00a0 of skin condition please be kind to yourself\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching this video once\u00a0\u00a0 again and i hope you found this video helpful\u00a0\nand i'll see you guys on my next video if you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't subscribed please do i love to have\u00a0\nyou on my channel till then take care bye guys",

        "transcript": "a great anti-aging skincare routine does not have to be complicated so I'm going to show you how to build one for both morning and night if you're new here welcome otherwise welcome back I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel this video contains a partnership with first aid Beauty and in a little I'm going to talk more about their new retinol product that I think is an amazing addition to a nighttime skincare routine especially if you have sensitive skin so I really wanted to build both a morning and a nighttime skincare routine for you here I have never done that in a YouTube video before but I feel like we're at the beginning of the year a lot of people have made resolutions to take better care of their skin but sometimes taking that first step of putting the routine together can be the most intimidating so I really wanted to break it down for you especially if you're new to skin care or new to incorporating anti-aging skincare into your your routine I'm going to start off with my nighttime skincare routine and then I'm going to meet you back here in the morning and do the morning skincare routine for you I feel like calling this an anti-aging skincare routine can be a bit triggering for people I'm not saying that we shouldn't age truly aging is a privilege but what I run into in my practice is that people come in feeling like their outside doesn't match how good they feel on the inside and that disconnect when you are younger is maybe not so obvious but I've seen it in my patients as they get into their 40s 50s 60s and Beyond it starts to become really frustrating so I don't think we have to have this hyperfocus on looking youthful but I do see the toll it takes when your skin doesn't reflect how good you feel and so when I'm talking about putting together an anti-aging routine it's really to maintain the health of your skin so you can be confident in what you're walking around the world in so every nighttime skincare routine is going to start with a cleanse we need to prep the canvas there is a lot of stuff that accumulates on our face during the day some we purposely put there like skin care and makeup some is just the sweat and grime and pollution from the day and regardless all of that needs to come off so that whatever we are putting on to leave on overnight can work its best effects and isn't fighting with anything else that's been left on our skin from the day and I'm going to be doing a double cleanse tonight I do this almost every night so if you are newer to skincare or building a routine a double cleanse involves either like an oil or a jelly cleansing step to remove the vast majority of the residue and then it's usually followed with a water-based cleanse to just get the rest off and some people might say that's not a simple routine why wouldn't you just give me one cleanser but I find a big mistake that people make is that they think their one cleanser is removing all the residue from their skin so one way you can test this is you can wash your face with your favorite cleanser and then take like a very clean white towel afterward and wipe your face and if you have no residue on the towel for example if you were wearing makeup that day then that one cleanse is probably doing the trick but I can tell you anytime I try to get away with a single cleanse if I have makeup or water resistant sunscreen on it's not happening the first cleansing step that I'm going to use tonight is the Crave beauty makeup rewind transforming jelly cleanser this was like one of my absolute favorite products that I used in 2023 and I've brought it with me into the new year so you can see it's kind of like a gel and then I'm going to warm it up in my hands and then I'm going to apply it to my face and let it sink in and massage it in to kind of start breaking down my makeup I'm going to take some more onto my eyes as well and just slowly and gently work that in if you care about anti-aging be delicate with your skin now skin is fairly resilient I mean touching your skin is not going to be a problem but sometimes I see people like really working it in around their eyes and like if you want your your eyes to look good now and 10 years from now be [Music] gentle now that that is all massaged in I'm going to rinse it off and then go in with my second cleanse I feel like that first cleanse did a really good job at removing the majority of my makeup but I still see some little traces so I'm going to go in with my second cleanse now I'm using the cavey hydrating facial cleanser when you are putting together an anti-aging skincare routine or a new skin skare routine you don't always have to have everything in your routine be new so if you've been using a drugstore cleanser for a long time and you like it bring it on into the new routine this is a really nice gentle cleanser so I'm just going to give a little water in that I recommend it all the time to my patients who have more sensitive skin still really effective but non-stripping nice and nourishing just going to work that into the skin doesn't sting around the eyes and and then once I've sort of done that we're going to rinse it off okay so now the canvas is fully prepped we are ready to go in with the Heavy Hitters for anti-aging and if someone were to ask me like what is the number one anti-aging skincare ingredient that you need in your nighttime skincare routine and I don't care where I am if I'm at a cocktail party talking skincare if I'm in clinic talking skincare 10 out of 10 times I'm going to say a topical retinoid retinoids are molecules derived from vitamin A and when applied topically they signal the skin to do so many wonderful healthy anti-aging things like improve skin cell turnover so that your skin may look less dull improve pigmentation in your skin help build collagen within your skin which is going to help with fine lines and wrinkles so really they do so much when it comes to anti-aging for being just one thing now that may sound too good to be true and sometimes it is because on the flip side of being very helpful for anti-aging skin things retinoids can also be quite irritating they can cause flaking peeling dryness redness stinging I mean I cannot think of a more problematic skin care ingredient in that respect I have so many people who come into my office as dermatologist who are saying hey Dr Ellis like I want to incorporate aoid but I just can't because I can't get my skin to tolerate it and that's where the product I'm using tonight really comes in so this is a newer launch from first aidid Beauty and it is their 0.3% % retinol complex serum and I love this for a lot of reasons this is a retinol product that is actually years in the making and what makes it so special is that it's really designed for sensitive skin the goal with this is to be able to use it regularly and consistently enough without irritation that you actually get to see the benefits of using a topical renoid over time also just a shout out for the texture of this I'll put it on my face in a second but I have to show you so it is a serum but it is a very lushy plushy serum like do you see how juicy that is like I actually cannot wait to put that on my face and I also think that is part of generating like a good skincare routine it has to be something that you actually look forward to doing and I I genuinely am looking forward to putting this on my face I also really like that this is a pump dispenser because the pump is a perfect serving size for your face so you do not need a big amount of retinoid to get a lot of improvement I find a huge error that people make is they over apply their retinoid and that's going to lead to more irritation granted you could probably slather your face in this and it won't cause irritation because of how it's formulated but just in case we'll just use exactly what we need and I do my tiny dot method which helps you spread it very evenly over the entire surface of the face without wasting it and without needing to use too much I'm going to grab another pump for my neck and my chest so the 0.3% retinol complex in here has retinol but it also has a vitamin a derivative that you might be less familiar with called retinol propionate and the advantage of using retinol propionate in a formula is that you can get the same effects of retinol as shown in some clinical studies but with less irritation so why wouldn't you want equivalent results with fewer side effects of course as a dermatologist I am always giving skincare recommendations and I would say one of the things I get asked about the most is a ret Noid that is not going to be problematic for sensitive skin or retinoid that someone could potentially use with their rosacea or their eczema or a retinoid that they can use as a beginner step in an anti-aging skincare routine and this one from first aid Beauty it is so good I mean not only is it gentle and effective but also experientially like just how my skin feels right after putting it on and what it's done for my skin over time like I feel very good about it now I'm a dermatologist I also use prescription strength retinoids but I can't always always especially if my skin is really irritated or acting up also I have a partner who is very stubborn and does not like to use retinoids and he has been asking for this I mean to have my husband ask for any skincare product is the highest compliment so if you have someone in your life who needs to start on a retinoid maybe try this one the fourth and final step of this nighttime skincare routine is going to be applying a moisturizer and the moisturizer I'm using tonight is one of my absolute favorite moisturizers of all time this is probably one of the very first skinc care products that was ever holy gril for me it's the first aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream this texture like you know your skin is going to be so moisturized after that and I love it because it has oatmeal so it is very soothing I'm a big oatmeal gal it can help with irritation it can help with a disrupted Skin Barrier so I'm just a huge fan of this moisturizer all around I recommend it to so so many people you can use it on your face and your body which I also like a multi-purpose type of product and if you are really prone to dry skin flaky skin even without like a renoid in your routine if that's just something that you deal with because you might have mature skin or eczema or you're just dry this is an excellent excellent moisturizer I went in with layer number two and I actually bring a lot of my moisturizers over my lips as as well I usually go in with some type of Vaseline at night right before bed but I actually like to bring my moisturizer onto my lips that is it for my nighttime skincare routine I will meet you back here in the morning to show you exactly what I put on my skin during the day to protect it and help it Thrive all day long see you soon good morning it is nice to see you again it is quite early but I like to get my skincare routine in before my son wakes up because once he's up you know it's unle leashed we don't know if I'm going to have time to Circle back to do a routine so finding time in your day to be consistent with your routine whether it's an anti-aging routine whether it's an acne routine is so so important consistency above all else is what's going to help you find success and my skin feels great from last night it is hydrated it is not irritated it's not bright red and you know for someone like me who has sensitive skin who has rosacea there are a lot of products that can really set my skin off so for me to wake up with just very happy skin is such a win and with that let's get into our morning skincare routine this is going to be simple straightforward efficacious this is actually just a two product routine you could expand it from there but I am really kind of taking this down to the Bare Essentials and this is actually quite representative of what I do on a typical workday I don't have a ton of time in the morning to get ready or I don't want to get up earlier to do a more protracted skincare routine so these are the things I stick with just like in a nighttime skincare routine the first thing we're going to do in a morning skincare routine is prepare our skin for any leave on products that we are going to be applying you can do that by washing your face with a cleanser and often times you can use the same cleanser that you used in the evening or you can just do a water cleanse Splash a little bit of water on your face to prep the skin this is what I do most days I feel like for a very long time people were sort of indoctrinated with the idea that you had to wash your face with a cleanser twice a day but for people who have dry skin super sensitive skin washing twice a day with a cleanser can actually be too much and it can be overly stripping to the skin even if you're using a gentle cleanser so if you've been struggling with dry or sensitive skin I totally encourage you to just give water cleansing in the morning a try so what that looks like for me is I'm just grabbing a little bit of water in my hands and we're just going to kind of Splash it on the face rub it around make sure I'm getting out any little eye boogers that uh formed overnight and after that I'm just going to take a clean towel and Pat my face dry we don't want to be scrubbing or rubbing especially if we're introducing a renoid product our skin is going to tend to be more sensitive and so you don't want to be doing added exfoliation with a rough towel so I'm just patting dry leaving it the tiniest bit damp for the next step and we're going to move on now if someone told me I could only use one product in the morning for an anti-aging skincare routine or really any type of skincare routine it would absolutely be sunscreen when it comes to anti-aging when it comes to skin Health in general sunscreen and sun protection is really doing the heavy lifting but if I got to pick a second thing to use in my routine it would absolutely be a topical antioxidant and specifically vitamin C in the evening a skincare routine is really focused on correction correction of whatever bothers you whether that's fine lines and wrinkles dehydrated skin pigmentation irregularities damaged Skin Barrier nighttime is for correction daytime skincare is really focused on protection as we go through our day our skin gets assaulted by environmental exposures whether that's UV radiation from sunlight or pollution and so we are doing a morning skincare routine to protect against damage of course you can have corrective steps during your morning skincare routine but I think if we are prioritizing and simplifying a routine focusing on protection against skin damage is the way to go obviously sunscreen is great for that but so is Vitamin C the vitamin C I'm using today is by my brand prequel it's called lucency so there are many benefits to topical vitamin C one being a protection Factor so it protects you against free radical damage so as your skin is assaulted during the day these little oxygen-free radicals form in the skin and they can bump around on important structures in your skin and prematurely break them down so vitamin C guards against that scrubbed a little bit here I'm going to rub it between my palms and then just press it into the skin and like any anti-aging skincare we are going to be bringing this down on the neck pardon me onto the chest chest um and onto the back of the hands as well I always find it so satisfying to get that First skinc Care step on my skin in the morning it's like okay the day is happening but aside from the protective abilities of vitamin C it also has these other benefits like brightening the skin helping with hyperpigmentation also helping support collagen synthesis so anything that's going to help us make new collagen make new structural support proteins in the skin is going to help anti-ag us and again anti-aging means something different for everyone I know that word doesn't sit right with some people but really what I'm thinking about is having healthier skin skin that you feel more confident in skin that is stronger and more robust and that's really the ultimate goal after the vitamin C has dried down on the skin which really just takes a few seconds I'm going to be moving onto my second and final step of my morning skincare routine which is sunscreen now a lot of people will want to put on other serums in the morning or maybe even apply a Moisturizer in the morning and you can always use the same moisturizer that you used in the evening if you feel like it's light enough but in my case I find that a lot of sunscreens I use tend to be moisturizing enough a lot of sunscreens are formulated in more moisturizing bases so unless you're really struggling with super dry skin or lots of sensitivity you actually don't necessarily need a moisturizing step in the morning and the sunscreen I'm going to be going in with today is a Korean sunscreen by a brand called Paro it is the daily soft touch sunscreen it is SPF 50 so nice high levels of sun protection of both UVA and UVB rays so as a reminder UVA radiation longer wavelength penetrates deeper in the skin more so contributes to premature skin aging wrinkles things like that and then UVB radiation shorter wavelength hits the top of the skin more likely to cause things like skin cancer I'm almost done with this tube so I hope I can get enough out this is one of my favorite sunscreens ever just goes in so effortlessly to the skin kind of like a yogurty texture when I think of anti-aging skincare like when I'm talking to patients in the office and counseling them when they're like Dr Ellis can you just make me a routine like what do I need what are the essentials I talk about the anti-aging Holy Trinity which is a retinoid which we used in our nighttime skincare routine vitamin C which we just put on and sunscreen if you have those three things you are so so set if you do them consistently so sunscreen is just kind of the final piece of that puzzle you'll also see that I'm bringing the sunscreen very up close under my eyes and onto my eyelids not everyone can tolerate that if you have really sensitive eyes and you can't put sunscreen around your eyes just wear big sunnies when you're outside if you're getting a little bit of sun or you know sun exposure while you're inside I'm not too worried about it it's really that sun damage that happens when you're outside in harsh sunlight that is going to cause the greatest problems when it comes to skin health and uh causing damage to your skin all right so I mean look at the finish on that like so stunning and that's the other thing if you starting a skincare routine you're more new to Skin Care finding products that you love not just what they do for your skin but the texture the application even the packaging is so important I feel like you need to be motivated to use your skincare it's a habit and you need to be inspired and so finding the sunscreen that you love the vitamin C that you like the retinoid that works for you and that you enjoy using those are all such important factors when it comes to being consistent over time and seeing results and with that final skincare step we are done here thank you so much for joining me for both my nighttime skincare routine and my morning skincare routine I hope you picked up a tip or two if you learned anything or you have any additional advice for sensitive skin definitely put it in the comments below

        "transcript": "if you're in your 30s you're probably starting to notice the early signs of skin aging so here are 10 things you can do to make your skin look its best [Music] hey if you're new to the channel welcome I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel the reason I think it's important to really start thinking about your skin of course in your 20s but especially in your 30s is because you start to really notice those signs of skin aging and I find a lot of my patients at this point in their life are wondering what they should be doing I think before we decide what we need to be doing for our skin in our 30s it's important to understand the skin aging process oftentimes when someone is nearing their 30s or gets into their 30s they start to notice specific skin changes that begin to bother them so something like dullness for example our skin cell turnover really slows down as we get older and so we're not sloughing off those top layers of skin as readily and so the skin begins to look a little bit drab people in their 30s will also notice that their skin tends to look a little bit drier and that's just because you're getting further away from those oily teenage years those sebaceous glands that make oil for your skin are not working as much your skin also naturally produces hyaluronic acid which keeps it Supple and moist but that production also decreases as we get older another thing people may start to notice in their 30s is volume loss so you get some descent and shrinkage of the fat pads in the face so you may notice hollowness in the cheeks and in the temples and you also get a little bit of bone loss and you can think of Bones as the real support structure under your skin and as bone loss progresses as we get older you essentially lose that support structure under your skin and it's one of the main contributors to sagging as we get a little bit older too our hormones tend to shift and that can really lead to some undesirable changes in the skin like adult female acne I'm in my mid-30s and I think about my friends and we're having babies and our weight is fluctuating and we're also starting to see the sun damage that we incurred when we were kids and in our 20s really starting to take its toll now and obviously when I'm talking about skin care in your 30s it's a little bit of a generalization we're all on a different aging timeline we all have different goals so some of you may be watching this in your 20s because you're starting to notice those early signs of aging some people are blessed and never experience these things or experience them much later in life tip number one is get on a skincare routine and this might sound silly to say I think a lot of people who watch YouTube videos and especially are interested in skincare started a skincare routine a long time ago but what I find is a lot of my patients are coming in in their 30s and they have never really established any type of skin care routine and when I'm talking about a skincare routine it doesn't have to be anything extensive it just has to be something that you consistently do every single day I think as we get into our 30s we have a lot more going on in our life we have obligations to our friends and our families and our careers and it can be hard to find time to do skin care but if you make it a habit it's going to help you be consistent and in the end it's going to help you meet your skin goals and a consistent skincare routine does not have to be a 10-step routine it can involve a cleanser and sunscreen in the morning a cleanser and a Moisturizer in the evening maybe a retinoid we'll get to that but I think as long as you have something in the morning that's going to prepare and protect your skin for the day and something at night that's going to nourish your skin and maybe help with those early signs of skin aging that you might not be loving all your bases are really covered speaking of a skincare routine that brings me to tip number two which is use SPF every single day and that's not just the sunscreen that's already included in your makeup that's a nice First Step But ultimately the sunscreen and makeup is generally not protective enough because you're not applying enough makeup to actually get the SPF that's stated on the bottle so I really like people to apply a separate sunscreen and then of course you can go in with makeup that has sunscreen in it but you shouldn't rely on that alone another thing I'll notice is with my patients coming in whether it's for a medical Derm visit or a cosmetic consultation is they'll be really mad at themselves for not wearing sunscreen when they were younger and they feel like oh gosh I'm not starting till my 30s is it too late and it is never too late to start wearing sunscreen you can see benefits incorporating sunscreen into your routine at any stage in your life sunscreen is important for so many reasons number one it protects you against skin cancer and skin cancer affects one in five Americans so it's a really real risk that is highly highly preventable the other thing is sunscreen protects you against premature signs of skin aging whether that's fine lines or wrinkles or irregular pigmentation there's even a good clinical study that shows that wearing sunscreen consistently can actually help reverse signs of skin aging so it's not just about prevention but it's also about reversal I think part of incorporating sunscreen into a regular daily habit is finding a sunscreen that you absolutely love and they feel like sunscreen technology has come a long way in terms of textures and tints and there is a sunscreen out there for everyone I have lots of videos with my favorite sunscreen so it may take some trial and error to find a sunscreen that you absolutely love but once you have that you're set tip number three start a topical retinoid so retinoids are a very famous category of ingredients in dermatology because they are sort of the Holy Grail anti-aging topical they help with things like fine lines and wrinkles because they stimulate collagen production and they inhibit collagen breakdown they also help correct pigmentation and make the skin look less dull so when I think of like one skincare ingredient besides sunscreen that's going to make a meaningful tangible difference in your skin it's a retinoid retinoids come in prescription Forum so maybe you've heard of something like Retin-A which is also known as tretinoin but you can also get non-prescription retinoids like retinol and retinaldehyde from other retailers the other thing that's really important to note about topical retinoids and it's sort of something I counsel all of my patients on when they're starting to think about incorporating a retinoid into their routine is they can cause a little bit of irritation stinging redness flaking when you first start them so starting with something that's a little bit more gentle can help ease that transition I have an entire YouTube video dedicated to beginner retinoids but one of my favorites is the rock retinol rock is sort of one of the OG Brands when it comes to developing a stable retinol that can be incorporated into a variety of products but they make an excellent face cream that I think is great for beginners the other thing that I really like about this is that it's formulated in a really rich moisturizing base so you're sort of achieving two skincare steps in one it can act as your topical retinol and your moisturizer another topical retinoid that I really love is by medicate and it's their Crystal retinal some people want to know what the difference is between retinol and retinol or retinaldehyde and the real difference is when retinol is absorbed into your skin it has to go through two conversion steps to reach the active form in your skin called retinoic acid whereas retinaldehyde only has to go through one conversion step and for that reason it's more powerful but also seems to be a lot more gentle for some people the reason I like the Medicaid Crystal retinal is because one medicate is sort of a Pioneer when it comes to formulating really stable effective retinoids that can be accessible to many different people but I also love that this system incorporates various strengths so it has five different strengths of retinol so you can start with something a lot more gentle and as you see the progress and as your skin begins to tolerate those stronger retinoids you can work your way up in the system I think one one thing that's important to note about topical retinoid use is that you should stop it if you're trying to conceive or you are pregnant now you can definitely use topical retinoids when you're breastfeeding but if you're in that period of your life where you're trying to get pregnant or you're actively pregnant I wouldn't recommend using a topical retinoid just out of an abundance of caution one thing my patients will ask me if they're sort of in their child bearing years is well is it even worth it for me to start a retinoid now or should I just wait till I'm done having kids and I think if your skin is not particularly sensitive and you're able to ramp up to regular retinoid use over the course of a month or two it is worth it to intermittently use a retinoid when we're thinking about the benefits that retinoids have it's cumulative over the course of your life so if you can use a retinoid intermittently in your 30s and then get more consistent about it in your 40s it's still going to benefit you skincare tip number four is consider incorporating some type of exfoliation into your skincare routine like I mentioned earlier as we get into our 30s our rate of skin cell turnover kind of slows down and we may notice that our skin looks a little bit more dull and although retinoids can help somewhat with this some people need an added Boost from a pure exfoliant when we think about exfoliants they tend to fall in two main categories physical exfoliants and chemical exfoliants physical exfoliants physically break apart that outer dead skin cell layer so you can think of like Scrubs for example and then you have chemical exfoliants so these are gentle acids that work to break apart your skin cells through a chemical reaction I feel like dermatologists in general have a preference for chemical exfoliants because they can be a little bit more gentle on the skin and you can really tailor them in terms of strength to getting the outcome that you want whereas a physical exfoliant feels a little bit more harsh and intense but in reality I think either one can be really effective and some people really prefer physical exfoliation and if that doesn't cause excessive irritation for you go for it some of my favorite exfoliating acids are glycolic acids so this is a very small molecule acid it can penetrate a little bit deeper into the skin and can exert the most powerful exfoliating effects if you have more sensitive skin you may want to consider something like lactic acid or mandelic acid because it's a little less harsh on the skin now when it comes to glycolic acid exfoliants I've talked about this one so many times but the good genes exfoliant by Sunday Riley is amazing and actually now that I come to think of it they have a glycolic version and a lactic acid version I usually recommend starting with the lactic acid again because it's a little more gentle but if you feel like your skin can handle a little extra oomph you could switch over to the glycolic acid the the other thing I really like about chemical exfoliants whether it's glycolic acid or lactic acid mandelic acid salicylic acid is they're generally considered safe in pregnancy in breastfeeding and when trying to conceive and a lot of my patients will bring up the fact that like hey I'm pregnant and I feel like my skin looks horrible and I want to do something that's either anti-aging or gives me a little bit of that glow that everyone told me I was going to have in pregnancy and I'm not really experiencing and topical chemical exfoliants can be a great way to help you achieve that the last thing I'll say about exfoliation in general is that it's up to you how frequently you think your skin can handle it in your skincare routine so if you're using a topical retinoid every single night I think a chemical exfoliant one to two nights Max a week is really appropriate however if you're not using a topical retinoid some of these chemical exfoliants are gentle enough to use every single night or every other night and you won't experience irritation tip number five use a moisturizer now I have considered myself a dry skin gal my entire life but I could kind of get away with the moisturizer that was incorporated into my sunscreen as part of my morning routine as time has gone on though I really find that I enjoy you using a moisturizer both in my morning routine before my sunscreen as well as in my evening routine to sort of lock everything that I've applied in place as you get older your sebum production or your oil production tends to go down and so those natural oils that your skin may have relied upon in the past are no longer available for you moisturizers can also be really beneficial in your 30s because they help with sort of this immediate Plumping and smoothing effect so if you're starting to notice those fine lines on your cheeks or around your eyes they can help blur and correct that and then lastly in your 30s you may be starting to incorporate things like a retinoid or chemical exfoliant in Your Skin Barrier may be taking a temporary hit so using a nourishing and soothing moisturizer regularly is going to help you tolerate these other actives better one of my favorite Rich creamy moisturizers is by skin fix it's their triple lipid peptide moisturizer one of the reasons I really like this is because it is Rich and nourishing and creamy but it's not so heavy that you couldn't wear it during the day under your makeup or under your sunscreen I found at least that as I've gotten into my 30s I crave those richer creamier moisturizers and although I do love lightweight moisturizer from time to time my skin really drinks this one up if you are looking for something a little bit more lightweight or a moisturizer that's still going to hydrate your skin but maybe you're wearing it in hotter weather or over the summer I really love the Aveeno oat gel moisturizer I really love this one for dry or irritated skin and it's really nice that it's available at the drugstore now I know I just talked a lot about chemical exfoliants and retinoids two things that have the potential to irritate your skin so tip number six is don't overdo it I feel like sometimes once we've decided that we're going to incorporate a skincare active into our routine we really just go all in we don't ease ourselves in we might start a retinoid and a chemical exfoliant at the same time don't do that when it comes to anti-aging it's a marathon not a Sprint also I find it's a lot harder to make a skincare habit and use things regularly if your skin always feels like it's irritated or inflamed so give yourself a little Grace when you start incorporating these things into your routine it took me almost six months to be able to use a retinoid every single night so if it takes you a little while that is no big deal don't push it so I know we've been talking a lot about facial skin but tip number seven is don't forget your neck your neck is one of those things that you might not be thinking about and then all of a sudden you look at your neck one day and there's lines or wrinkles or crepey skin and now it feels like it might be too late most women will start to see noticeable signs of skin Aging in their neck in their 40s and 50s so if you can get ahead of it in your 30s you're going to be so happy now a lot of neck aging is really genetic you might that one of your parents and go oh I might be headed there but there are still proactive things you can do the first thing is all of the skincare that I've already talked about using sunscreen retinoids chemical exfoliants they can all be used on the neck as well now neck skin tends to be a lot more sensitive so you may not be able to use the same potency of product or you might not be able to use it as frequently but always bring your neck into your skincare routine and while I'm speaking of neck bring your chest into your skincare routine bring your hands into your skincare routine these are all areas that show a lot of sun damage as we get older and tend to age us so don't just focus on your face now some habits that you can incorporate to help how your neck ages is thinking about your posture and some of your habits in which you are looking down whether you're looking at your phone or you tuck your chin when you sleep those are all things that are going to contribute to horizontal neck creases now cosmetically there are things we can do to correct that to some degree but prevention is the name of the game I'm not a big hacks person but one of my favorite life hacks is to take silicone on scar tape so the thing we have patients use after surgery to improve the appearance of their scars and you can actually apply it to horizontal neck bands especially when you're sleeping or hanging out at home because that will prevent your skin from creasing so for example I have a lot of patients who sleep on their side and they wish they could sleep on their back because they know it's better for how their skin and neck is going to age but ultimately getting good sleep is better than teaching yourself to sleep on your back if that's not a comfortable position for you but if they apply those silicone sheets to their neck when they're sleeping then at least when they're on their side and their chin is tucked they're not worsening those creases and that's meaningful because you're sleeping for six seven eight nine hours a night so if you can do nine hours of neck prevention every single day you're going to be in good shape tip number eight get your acne in check I treat a lot of adult female acne and basically every patient who comes in is like listen Dr Ellis I am too old to be breaking out and I agree there is something you can do for that even if you never had acne when you were a teenager or in your 20s it may not be that your hormones have significantly changed in your 30s but your skin is responding to your normal hormone levels in a different way these hormonal pimples tend to look a little bit different than the traditional acne that someone may have had in their teenage years they tend to be these deeper cystic more tender bumps on the chin and on the jawline and there are definitely treatments that we can do to make them a lot better the other thing is I find that people kind of are delayed in coming in they might have been dealing with acne for two or three or four years and they're like I thought I was just going to grow out of this and the thing about adult acne is that you don't tend to grow out of it as readily so if it's something that bothers you get in with a dermatologist and start making some interventions tip number nine for skincare in your 30s is consider a cosmetic consult I feel like a lot of people in their 30s are starting to think about things like botox or lasers or they're starting to see their peers get these procedures and they have a lot of anxiety because they're sitting at home going do I need this should I be talking about this am I old enough am I too young for this and really the best step is to get a cosmetic consultation what I talk about with my patients is the fact that you should never feel pressure to do anything but the more you're informed and the more education you have at least allows you to kind of get your mind around what's possible for you and maybe have a timeline moving forward it can be hard to know who to see for a cosmetic consultation but I typically recommend starting with a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon someone who does cosmetic procedures all the time don't get me wrong there are amazing physician assistants and nurse practitioners out there who inject and do lasers but training can really vary and it's not necessarily standardized so it's harder to guarantee what kind of experience you may have I'd say some of the most common procedures that I do on patients in their 30s are things like botox some light resurfacing whether that's in the form of lasers like fraxel and clear and Brilliant or IPL also known as photofacial also things like chemical peels and micro needling can be helpful to resurface the skin and help stimulate collagen the other thing we'll often do for patients in their 30s are beautification procedures so we're not necessarily trying to anti-age them because many people aren't showing signs of aging in their 30s but they feel like there are things they could do to make them feel a little bit more attractive whether that's adding a little bit of volume to someone's lips or using a little bit of Botox in the masseter area to slim the jaw no matter what if you're you're getting cosmetic procedures in your 30s or just getting educated about them you don't want to leave the office looking like a totally different person the goal really here is to prevent and to make you look like a better version of yourself or just a little bit refreshed when I think about my friends or the patients that come into my office who are in their 30s they're always a bit hesitant to do cosmetic procedures and honestly I think that's a good place to start I'd rather someone be nervous about cosmetic procedures than just go in and want to do everything but they're also concerned that they're going to look fake or overdone or get botched and the reality is if you're seeing an experienced injector someone who's experienced with laser and you're in your 30s they're really going to guide you to look like the best version of yourself to look more refreshed and everything should be subtle and natural I also want to mention that everyone is on their own cosmetic Journey everyone ages differently everyone has their own cosmetic goals and so just because all your friends are getting Botox you might not be ready for Botox or just because your friends are getting lip filler that might not suit you so it's really important to find a cosmetic provider that is going to tailor your treatments and your recommendations to your goal and the skin that you're currently in I also think about the fact that you want to form a long-term relationship with your dermatologist or whoever your cosmetic provider is because aging doesn't happen just once and then you never see your injector again I love to see my patients at least a couple times a year and it doesn't mean we're doing procedures every time they come in but we're just touching base figuring out what their goals are having a plan for next steps so that they continue to age in a way that is graceful and they know what's coming next and my final skincare tip for people in their 30s is to prioritize your overall health it's really hard to feel confident in your appearance if the rest of your health has taken a hit and this can happen in our 30s Our Lives get busier we might be committing to our sleep less we might not have an exercise routine anymore we might not be eating the best but all of those things make a huge difference in the health of your skin and the way your skin ages over time so things like sleep exercise Nutrition Therapy to help with Stress Management actually going to the doctor preventative medicine is a thing in seeing people before you're feeling ill or before you're having certain complaints is also a really big part of maintaining and managing your overall health one of the reasons I wanted to become a Dermatologist in the first place is because so much of what happens internally is manifested externally on the skin and oftentimes you can look at someone and tell that they're not healthy just by looking at their skin and so many times I have patients who come into my office who are dealing with a breakout or hair loss and it's not due to anything that's specifically happening with their skin it's due to a life stressor or another event or a separate illness that's affecting how their skin or hair looks and sometimes someone may be struggling with a health condition that hasn't even been diagnosed yet for example someone who has hypothyroidism or low thyroid function they may have signs of it on their skin like dry skin brittle nails hair that's falling out or shedding really easily and a dermatologist can actually make that diagnosis not to mention when you're not feeling good it's very hard to prioritize taking care of your skin or your hair so it can become this vicious cycle so there you have it 10 skin care tips for your 30s now you don't have to go out and incorporate all of these all at once baby steps you're in your 30s for 10 years so you have a little bit of time but as you work to make these changes I think you're going to be a lot happier with your skin do you have any 30 skincare tips that you want to add put them in the comments as always thank you so much for watching don't forget to subscribe to the channel and like this video and I'll see you next

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can check it out also if you want to Deep dive on information about any of these skin conditions you can actually search Cassandra Banks and rosacea or Cassandra bankson sunburn or Cassandra bankson skin condition in the YouTube search bar and we've probably done a video on it specifically if you search Cassandra bankson how to treat a sunburn I've shared with you some of my best tips and tricks as well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this next video love you guys hey",

        "transcript": "I'm back with another affordable skincare routine this is a morning routine focused on repairing Your Skin [Music] Barrier if you're new to the channel welcome I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good don't forget to subscribe to the channel and like this video I'm actually thrilled that people are coming around to the idea of supporting and repairing their skin barrier now it is a little bit redundant to say Skin Barrier because in and of itself skin is a barrier it's what divides your external World from your insides that being said your skin is made up of several different cellular layers and as you get closer to the surface of the skin or those outermost cellular layers those are the skin cells that serve the most protective role so really when we're talking about repairing and protecting the Skin Barrier we are talking about using products and using skin practices that help keep that surface layer of skin cells intact the way I like to describe it to my patients is your outermost layer of skin cells are like bricks and those bricks or skin cells are held together by mortar and in your skin that mortar is made up of a complex of proteins and lipids or proteins and fats now when you have a disruption in Your Skin Barrier it can be because the cells themselves or the bricks have an issue or it can be because the mortar or the protein and lipid complex that is holding those skin cells or bricks together has an issue and sometimes it can be both in fact in the world of medical Dermatology there are numerous skin disorders in which people are unable to produce these proteins and fats that create Their Skin Barrier or they produce dysfunctional proteins or fats and because of this these people often will have skin dryness skin flaking blistering skin fragility increased skin infections Etc because they are unable to create a strong Skin Barrier to protect themselves now something that's much more common than being born with a Skin Barrier disorder is actually being born with healthy fully functioning skin but then doing something to your skin for example overe exfoliating that then goes and disrupts that Skin Barrier and I feel like we've all done that before we think we're doing a skincare routine that's going to help us with our fine lines and wrinkles or our acne and we wake up the next day and our skin feels dry and tight it might be red it might be flaking it might be burning and stinging when we put our products on and that's a sign that our Skin Barrier is struggling and since most of us have been in that situation before and I'm assuming you have because you're watching this video I wanted to give you a skincare routine that you can use to help restore or repair Your Skin Barrier and give you one that's affordable okay let's get into the routine I wanted to make you a morning routine because I feel like there's a good number of nighttime skincare barrier repair routines out there and of course if you want me to make you one of those I certainly can but Skin Barrier repair needs to be in the morning as well and one of the core principles of skin barrier repair is eliminating actives from your routine so at night that means getting rid of your retinoids and maybe your exfoliating acids and often in the morning that means taking out vitamin C because that is a skincare active and it can be irritating for a lot of people so less is best when it comes to repairing your barrier okay so first step in a routine cleansing now I'm going to recommend that if your Skin Barrier is disrupted and it's not feeling great that you just cleanse with water yes that is perfectly okay and I've had so many people tell me that just by changing their routine from washing twice a day to just washing in the evening has made their skin less sensitive and overall feel better so I just have some lukewarm water running here and I'm just going to get my hands wet and just sort of massage that into my face I don't need to wash off the products I wore last night they've sort of rubbed off on my pillow or absorbed into my skin by now and then I'm going to gently Pat my skin dry No harsh rubbing okay okay first step of my morning routine is done and it cost absolutely nothing so I feel like we're staying on budget so for most days at this point in my routine I would go in with my vitamin C but again we're skipping all skincare actives so instead while my skin is still I'm going to go in with a hydrating skin serum and just to give you a preview I'm going to go in with a hydrating serum then a moisturizer then a sunscreen and depending on what your skin is feeling like whether you tend to lean oily or dry or are acne prone or just how many products you want to have in your routine some of these steps are optional I would say sunscreen is never optional but whether you do a hydrating serum and then your sunscreen or just a moisturizer and then your sunscreen or do all three steps like I'm going to demonstrate for you today you just want to make sure that your including steps only because you need them and not just because you think you should have them in your routine so reasons why you might want to do a serum and a moisturizer because for a lot of people a moisturizer is going to be absolutely enough and for some people even just using their sunscreen as their moisturizer will be completely adequate but I like to go in with a hydrating serum because often times in these hydrating serums one of the principal ingredients is something called A humant and A humant is just a category of skincare ingredients that helps draw water to the Skin's surface and I find When My Skin Barrier is disrup Ed my skin tends to look a little bit depleted it looks dry the fine lines are emphasized like my skin just doesn't look great and so I like using a hydrating serum to help bring that water to my skin surface to plump it out a bit also depending on which serum you're using it may have additional beneficial skincare ingredients that are not contained within your moisturizer or within your sunscreen so it's an opportunity to introduce new beneficial skincare ingredients into your routine so today I'm going in with the aino calm and restore triple oat serum and I believe this retail anywhere from $15 to $20 depending on where you're buying it from as the name of the product suggests it's meant to calm and restore your skin bear now this dropper mechanism not my favorite but not horrible you can see it's on the thicker side but when you go to spread it so smooth it's great and I find that this layers really well with moisturizer and other products so I like to kind of put it on right away while my skin is damp to really trap that moisture there so for my face I'm probably going to put at least one dropper I think I need a second one all right two droppers full massage it on so this has glycerin which is the humant ingredient that I was talking about before that helps draw water to your skin surface and helps plump it out a little bit aeno is also pretty well known for including oat derivatives in its products and oats have soothing properties they have antioxidant properties so that's also all going to help restore your Skin Barrier so I'm just sort of massaging this around pressing it into my skin and of course bringing it down the neck so I found with using this product it feels a little bit tacky or sticky to the touch for about 30 seconds and then it pretty much completely dries down and once it's drag down then I go in with the third step of my routine so first step was cleanse with water Second Step hydrating serum and now moisturizer the moisturizer I'm going to go in with today is the deride relief barrier moisturizer what an appropriate Name by purito this is like a good siiz moisturizer you get a lot of product in here I think it retails for about 20 bucks and I'll just show you the texture here it's thick and creamy but I find not too heavy so I can wear it during the day but absolutely could use this as a nighttime moisturizer as well I feel like it sort of straddles the Daytime Nighttime moisturizer thickness quite well and you can see rubs in beautifully I'm going to use about a pump a little more than a p sized amount perhaps at night I tend to use more moisturizer and during the day I tend to use if I'm using moisturizer at all a smaller amount and the reason for that is I'm going to go in with another layer of skincare afterward my sunscreen and I just find that if I use a ton of moisturizer and then try to put my sunscreen on top I just I don't like how it feels on my skin and then sometimes I also can get peeling of the product where it starts to ball up into these little white balls on the skin and that's not cute super annoying you have to restart start your skincare routine so just a dim sized amount of moisturizer for me today again don't forget the neck there we go while I'm waiting for this moisturizer to dry down a little bit before I go in with my sunscreen I'll tell you the reason why I like this particular moisturizer so much is because of the valuable skincare ingredients that it has that support the Skin Barrier it contains some calming plant oils it also has allantoin and squalene and cholesterol and then the main sort of selling point of this moisturizer is the variety of ceramides that it contains and remember back at the beginning of this video when I was talking about how your skin cells are like the bricks of Your Skin Barrier and then you have this complex of fats and proteins that form the mortar to seal those skin cells or those bricks together well ceramides are a key component of that lipid protein matrix that helps seal your barrier so when your Skin Barrier is depleted or not functioning in an ideal way using products that have ceramides in them can help repair that barrier and bring it back to its original function and with that we will move on to the fourth and final step of this affordable morning skincare routine to support your Skin Barrier and of course we're going to end with the best it's sunscreen now a lot of people don't realize that your Skin Barrier actually helps protect your deeper layers of skin from UV damage so when you have a disrupted Skin Barrier your ability for your skin to protect itself from UV radiation goes down so sunscreen of course is going to be essential for skin barrier repair routine in the morning and honestly for any skin routine in the morning the sunscreen I'm going to use today is a Korean sunscreen it's from a brand called called belflower it's the avocado moisture sunscreen SPF 50 pa+++ plus let's get this on I just put a layer of that sunscreen on and totally didn't record it so I'm going to go in and put another layer on for you but you can see it leaves a really nice dewy finish and that's one thing I really like about this sun green is it's very lightweight but feels quite hydrating on the skin it has some amazing UV filters in it and it also has some great ingredients that help support Your Skin Barrier so it has niacinamide it has cantella asiatica which is anti-inflammatory and I think most importantly it just goes on so well and that might sound silly to prioritize that above all else when it comes to sunscreen but the best sunscreen is the one you will wear so finding one that has a texture that you like is essential so that's all dried down now I think it has a really beautiful Luminous Finish and for a dry skinned gal like me that is basically ideal I forgot to mention that this sunscreen generally retails from anywhere between 122 and $15 so highly affordable which I also love because I don't want anyone skimping on their sunscreen or even worse skipping their sunscreen because it's too expensive everyone should be able to afford sunscreen okay you've reached the end of this routine I hope you found it helpful if you want to see other types of affordable skincare routines let me know in the comments so I can make those for you also if you have any skin barrier repair products that you love throw them in the comments as well as always thank you so much for watching don't forget to like this video And subscribe to the channel and I'll see you next time [Music]",

        "published_at": "2022-04-14T13:04:10Z",
        "transcript": "now one of the most difficult things about rosacea is finding skin care that works for you and not against you so often the wrong thing can be the actual cause of a flare so today's video is all about giving you that essential tool kit so you have all the right ingredients in your skincare routine to help you tame the flames of rosacea now make sure you stay right to the very end because i'll be sharing my favorite ingredient last so the first ingredients i want to talk about are in fact spf filters because in my mind there is no skin care routine for rosacea that isn't underpinned by effective sun protection and that's because of the huge role that uva plays in rosacea and potentially triggering disease so when it comes to rosacea i am a fan of mineral filters meaning zinc oxide and titanium dioxide they just tend to do a better job less irritating great coverage and as a bonus i think that the right mineral sunscreen can actually really brighten the skin helping mask redness and serving as a great base for makeup now i i'm really dependent on gossamer tint one for that reason not only does it allow me to have the old day where i don't wear any makeup at all bar a little bit of concealer under my eyes because it evens out my complexion masking a little bit of that redness but also just delivering a really kind of glass skin glow and that's because of the way zinc and titanium look on the skin there's a reason why titanium dioxide is a component of many foundations but great for sensitive skin um great post procedure as well this is the kind of sunscreen we use after laser treatments and the like um and really i think a foundation when it comes to treating rosacea so when it comes to active rosacea the topical ingredient i find most helpful nowadays is actually something called ivamectin or sulantra on prescription something you'd have to get through your gp or dermatologist i just find it to be the most helpful thing when someone is undergoing a spotty flare some flare in the popular postular phase tends to be the thing that brings it under control most effectively and i also really like how it's formulated the base of this particular active is really soothing and kind and generally well tolerated in rosacea prime skin so i will typically use that at night to calm a flare sometimes in conjunction with oral antibiotics and over time typically i will transition from using cilantro maybe after six weeks maybe after 12 into using something else that is more about disease prevention so cilantro i reserve for the active spotty flares then coming on to more traditionally anti-inflammatory ingredients that we use in skin care niacinamide is something that i like a lot in those who are rosacea prone now it's often found in moisturizers like an hour of flawless moisturizer it's present at five percent just as it's in revival mask at 10 and i do think it's worth considering as an active and not just a moisturizing ingredient somebody actually made this point in one of our testimonials on the website i thought you know it's a good point i think it can easily get sort of lumped in with other ingredients like ceramides but in its own right niacinamide is an active not only does it help support barrier function increasing skin's own production of ceramides but it also helps stimulate collagen production it helps improve hyperpigmentation and you know it's anti-inflammatory so therefore potentially helpful with active papules and pustules in its own right but just like any active it can be something that causes irritation so always introduce new active ingredients even if they're in a moisturizer with care but typically those who've got redness prone skin find this to be really helpful then we come on to retinoids which can be a tricky topic in context of rosacea however when the timing is right i think they are profoundly useful so the timing is not right if you are having an active inflammatory flare the timing is worth considering if things are calm and we're really just looking to increase the density of the dermis which is something that i think given that we know that rosacea occurs in light-eyed light-skinned individuals who are potentially um exposed to uva as a consequence of you know everyday life i think it's really important to think about this as part of a holistic approach to managing rosacea um so timing has to be right the ingredient type has to be right so i'm not talking about going full tilt with tretinoin 0.05 i'm talking about dipping your toe in the water when things are calm to see if your skin will get on board now in the non-prescription space that might be something like granactive retinoid or retinaldehyde and on the prescription side of things i often use a dappling or differin cream not gel to test the waters to see if somebody is actually going to respond and when people do respond they respond well i mean as somebody with erythematology which can't even say it today erythematologic rosacea myself um i have definitely had to tread carefully when it comes to using a retinoid in my skin but it's necessary in terms of the general health and well-being so i'm just respectful and then saving the best to last azelaic acid i don't think i can even think of a single rosacea patient who doesn't rely on azelaic acid as part of their ongoing strategy for their rosacea maintenance and again i count myself in that azolic acid is just so helpful in rosacea because of its ability to down regulate that over enthusiastic inflammatory response part of what we call the innate immune system which when it's challenged by the external environment you know whether it's weather related whether it's things that we put on it or you know whether it's triggered by the things that we ingest azelaic acid just dials it down really nicely and the great thing is there is now you know a proliferation of azelaic acid-base products on the market so we can get on prescription phonation skinner in different percentages but essentially delivering the same amount of ingredient into the skin and then over the counter we have good old brightly serum with 10 azelaic acid and some other active ingredients alongside it including niacinamide and you know the ordinary has a really affordable version too so azolic acid i've talked about it at length before but i think for the rosacea sufferer particularly those who are concerned about staying fresh um it has additional benefits it's good for pigmentation it's good for texture it's a powerful antioxidant it's so versatile that you know as i've said many times before there has to be a really good reason for it not to be in the mix i've not mentioned metronidazole which it has historically been one of the antibiotic topicals that we use in rosacea i have to say that in my practice i have now evolved to almost exclusively using cilantro and azelaic acid information or skin or in format almost exclusively i just don't tend to use metronidazole topically at all anymore in part because the physical nature of those preparations often wasn't something that patients enjoy using they're often quite unpleasant in terms of the way they would layer on the skin but i just don't find them to be as effective but worth mentioning because if it's something that has worked for you and you get on with the preparations available that's you know metro gel or rosex cream then absolutely fine to keep going they are a recognized part of the treatment toolkit so i hope by now you're starting to feel like you have a bit more control over your rosacea you know where to turn to in terms of getting the right ingredients to tackle it and i'm going to be doing another couple of videos in this series um so you have a really complete bank of knowledge um when it comes to the nuances of dealing with rosacea and know that i'm with you on this journey it's something that i have you know honed my kind of skin care practices over the years to ensure that i get the best possible result in terms of managing my own tendency towards rosacea um so i hope it was helpful please do share this content with anybody who needs to know more about dealing with rosacea and i'll see you guys again soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "hello i'm dr vinita ratan i'm a doctor but i'm also a cosmetic formulator specifically for skin of color so today's video is about rosacea we're going to be talking about what it is what causes it what makes it worse how to treat it and the mistakes that people make right at the end i'm also going to go through product recommendations as you know none of my videos have ever been sponsored and they will never be sponsored this means we're basically creating a evidence-based video library for you so you know what to purchase and what to avoid if that sounds good to you give me a thumbs up let's dive right in so let's start off with what is it it is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it tends to take place actually more in europeans so basically northern and western europeans it only takes place in about four percent of the population that are asian or african so it's not that common um to actually have rosacea when you have skin of color however if you do have it and you have skin of color you have to be careful because with us our melanocytes are larger and they are easier to trigger already so as i always say one scratch one bite or one burn and we hyperpigment but when you have rosacea your skin is already more sensitive and if you use products on your skin that burn the skin or irritate the skin it's not just a temporary irritation it leads to hyperpigmentation which is why when you have rosacea in skin of color it's it can be far worse it can be affect your life more because the consequences of you trying to treat the rosacea you have to be far more careful with skin of color than you are with caucasian skin so there are a number of known potential triggers for this it could be down to your immunity it could be down to vascular disorders another one tends to be uv radiation which is why it tends to be worse in the sun and infectious agents too now the clinical cause of the disease can vary from person to person it tends to start off when you're younger with just redness of the skin so temporary flushing or temporary erythema erythema is just another word for redness and this gradually persists and it takes longer longer for the redness to go and on top of that you start to get telegectasia which is when you can see broken capillaries under the skin this all tends to indicate that this is a vascular condition and studies have also shown that there's increased blood flow in those erythema areas in the red areas i'm sure there are other triggers that you've probably noticed including stress menopause can make it worse alcohol spicy food and sometimes even exercise so anything that basically makes you go red when you have rosacea is just another phenomenon where the skin becomes more sensitive to for those of you who have an immune dysregulation this can happen in response to uv radiation microorganisms injury from physical or chemical injuries such as burns the environment such as wind hot weather or steam and also cosmetics that you put on the skin that are not naive safe so things that can irritate the skin can make it worse so for example if you have rosacea and you try using retinol which is an alcohol which can be irritating it can flare up the rosacea so you have to be a lot more careful with which creams you purchase and actually this whole channel i only ever recommend safe products that means no denatured alcohol no fragrance no essential oils these things can sensitize the skin and dry the skin which is exact opposite of what you want when you have rosacea so all the triggers i've just discussed can basically increase the cytokines in your skin and these are signaling mechanisms that tell the skin to wear now in an inflammatory mode to produce inflammatory mediators and this then leads to more blood flow in that area which makes your rosacea worse now when we talk about microorganisms and rosacea there are two main micro organisms that we're talking about demodex follicularum and h pylori let's start off with demodex follicularum this is a parasite that lives in the sebaceous gland and can lead to inflammation of the hair follicle clinical studies have basically shown that there's an increased amount of parasites in people with rosacea skin compared to healthy skin h pylori on the other hand is a little bit more controversial because studies tend to contradict each other h pylori is found in the blood serum of rosacea patients which means that there's an increased amount of antibodies to h pylori in those with rosacea these are small potential triggers the big one however is uv radiation uv radiation equals more erythema due to vasodilation so basically increased cytokines in the skin equals increased angiogenesis which means new blood capillary formation and of course more information moving on to reactive oxygen species now we all produce this it happens when uv hits the skin uh free radicals form but it also happens in your mitochondria in your body now this leads to an oxidative stress and this basically can reduce your natural defenses but also it increases cytokine production so i the mediator for inflammation this is one of the key reasons you really want to be ingesting antioxidants and using antioxidants on the skin so foods that are full of antioxidants are colorful foods so it's easy to remember beetroot broccoli oranges and then of course on the skin itself using antioxidants such as vitamin c i wouldn't use vitamin a retinol for rosacea i'd rather use either retinol palmitate which you can basically find in the in our dranita rattan power antioxidant serum which is your fat soluble vitamin c retinol palmitates a non-irritating form of vitamin a and your vitamin e and coenzyme q10 so you basically want to use antioxidants like that that are non-irritating but will mop up free radicals foods that we tend to say to avoid would be things like spicy food drinks such as caffeine and alcohol some people even say to stay away from dairy so things like cheese and chocolate we also tend to say to avoid smoking because of nicotine which is a vasodilator too so because this is a chronic condition it really is about managing the condition you want to avoid triggers as much as possible because every time you trigger the skin it takes longer for the erythema to go so you end up in a cycle where you know you trigger the skins taking ages trigger the skin again and it takes ages so actually understanding your skin and how to take care of your skin really is key to managing rosacea so what do we do step by step the first thing you want to do is block uv from hitting the skin this is the number one cause so you want to be using i would recommend a mineral spf 50. the reason is zinc oxide in your mineral sunscreen is anti-inflammatory so for example in um our zinc bowl which you can find from our website skincare by doctor v down below it's got 17 zinc oxide in it which is anti-inflammatory so you i would rather you wore a physical sunscreen over chemical sunscreen with rosacea i'd also recommend a wide brimmed hat to avoid any direct sunlight on the skin if your rosacea is mainly here in the zygoma areas of the cheekbone area then you can get yourself a pair of these so this basically i use this for my melasma on my cheekbones and it prevents a uv from hitting my skin and these are dr v sunglasses so they're massive but they're great for driving because when you're driving um sun tends to be quite low and it it hits the face and the skin is red you know one hour later i would manage your diet and stress levels because any form of stress makes chronic skin care conditions worse it ages the skin if you have eczema it worsens your eczema if you have acne it worsens your acne any condition you have worsens with stress so this is considering this a chronic condition i would be doing everything i can to manage my stress levels i also recommend you opt for mild skincare just because you know on tic toc there's the thirty percent aha bht um the red vial that everyone's using that would not be suitable for rosacea it will burn the skin and it will lead to hyperpigmentation for skin of color so you just need to think of your skin as very sensitive and needs to be taken care of gently even the actives that you choose should be mild they should have the same ph as your skin i would avoid acids as much as possible so i've written out a routine for you on what i would recommend so this routine is actually tried and tested because my husband has rosacea you know it affects him so i basically made this routine for him which has been doing for years and has controlled his rosacea so first thing in the morning i would wash your face with a micellar gel wash you can use the one from simple however because of sensitive skin the one that i basically the ingredients i put into our micellar gel wash contains niacinamide uh which is strength as a skin barrier plus i put incentella asiatica and panthenol which are both anti-inflammatory plus i'm putting glycerin which is a water magnet so you're holding water from that top layer of skin because with rosacea you basically want to create a healing environment for the skin and you don't want to over strip the skin when you're washing it that's the first mistake that gets made so this is our micellar gel wash which you can purchase from the link below too second you really should use a fatty moisturizer that has some key ingredients you want ceramides in there because ceramides are lipids they're fats that basically retain water in that top low skin and give you that healing environment and you want a long-term moisturizer you don't want a lotion where water is evaporating from the skin and the skin feels tight you want something that's going to feel hydrated all day so ingredients to look for in your moisturizer would be things like ceramides peptides anti-inflammatories you want niacinamide too which strengthens your skin barrier and humectant so those are the key ingredients you really want in a nice knife safe moisturizer for rosacea so the couple that i love i do love cerave because of the ceramides in it i love cetera ben it's a very simple knife safe moisturizer it doesn't contain all the bells and whistles that i discussed but it's a fatty moisturizer and then the one that i made was the serrapep brightening moisturizer and in here i basically applied put in the niacinamide your ceramized peptides and anti-inflammatories now with after this you really need to apply spf 50 considering uv is the um can really make rosacea worse and especially if you're in a hot country spf 50 is non-negotiable so after your nave safe moisturizer apply your anti-inflammatory sunscreen so ideally look for mineral sunscreens things that say 100 mineral sunscreen some of them are hybrid some of them you know have mineral plus chemical chemical i'm not a huge fan of for a number of reasons number one it's not great for sensitive skin number two i like to put sunscreen around the eye area because this is where you tend to wrinkle first and actually zinc oxide is much better for around the eye area it's a lot more gentle on the skin and is good for sensitive eyes too now things that you must avoid are exfoliation exfoliation is not your friend we're trying to strengthen the barrier the barrier is weak and damaged so please never exfoliate avoid retinol i'd rather go for retinal palmitate or retinaldehyde these are less irritating versions of vitamin a avoid ascorbic acid instead for tetrahexal dicoloscorbate that's a fat soluble vitamin c which actually strengthens um the collagen so it actually penetrates down into the dermis avoid lactic acid too which is just another acid that exfoliates menthol as well so things that tingle the skin basically for your time routine uh wash your face with your micellar gel wash again you want to remove the sunscreen or any makeup from the day then apply your antioxidant serum that has the same ph as your skin so it's non-irritating so for example the one that i you know give to my husband is our antioxidant power serum followed by your knee safe moisturizer so you want to create that healing environment on the skin if your skin is particularly dry you may also want to use a barrier oil on top something like marula oil from the ordinary is excellent drug elephant does a very good one too and that would just continue to retain water on the skin so minimize trans epidermal water loss don't forget to download your free guide for skin of color down below it's a new version please do follow me on instagram i've got two accounts dr mita ratan and skincare by dr v we tend to

        "transcript": "hello everybody i'm back back back again for my nighttime rosacea skincare routine um you have maybe seen the first part of this video which was my daytime and morning skincare routine for rosacea um so i shared my favorite products there and how i go on about it so today we are concentrating on the evening on cleansing the skin and treating the skin the same way as we did in the morning but i have quite a bit of a different lineup for the evening but the thing is that most of these products you can use morning or evening so i'm just giving you a selection of things that work for me personally and maybe that will work for you too so um if you haven't watched the first part i talked about um there was asia a little bit deeper in a little bit more details there so i recommend tuning into that first and then coming back to this video i decided to split them because the first one was getting so long so first things first i'm going to cleanse my skin because i have makeup on i've been using the it cosmetics cc cream which i love it has such a good high spf and such a beautiful finish on the skin um just love it love it love it so i'm gonna use a double cleanse so we're going to start with an oil cleanser and i'm using squalane and antioxidant cleansing oil this is a plant derived squalane and squalene is a fantastic ingredient to use pretty much on any skin types so i just take a pump and massage it into my skin and if you are into massage like i am this is your time this is your moment to give your skin a bit of loving if you have very very aggravated rosacea or very very sensitive skin and this is especially the good time to do it but just be a little bit more gentle on the areas where you get um quite inflamed where you get a bit red but just circular motions getting into those muscles kind of give your chewing muscle a little bit of extra loving to relax it maybe you're feeling tension around your brows and those angry elevens if you've been frowning a lot i love using my knuckles just because you get a little bit of deeper pressure and really nice on the cheeks as well a few swipes towards the ears and also on the neck if you're wearing makeup on the neck around the nose i've got quite heavy brows today so this is a fantastic oil to take the makeup off but also to do the massage with so i very often do my massages with um with oils with cleansing oils rather than with treatment oils so i'm just massaged it in and now i'm gonna rinse it with some water and a cloth the thing is that if are washing your face with water and you have rosacea or sensitive skin be very mindful about the temperature of the water only use lukewarm water um or like room temperature water but never hot water my second cleanse will be water-based cleanser and i'm using my miracle cleanser from aurelia this is probiotic skincare um and i love it i have been using it um for years now it's not targeting specifically um rosacea but it suits me it does have essential oils in it so if you get reactive to them then maybe um be a little bit more mindful about it but it has never caused me any irritation so again i'm gonna do one pump and it's a beautiful creamy milky cleanser so i've left the water on my face from the first cleanse and then i'm just doing the same this has that aromatherapy effect as well because it has beautiful sense of lavender and chamomile and bergamot and is just absolutely heavenly it's a really lovely cleanser to use in the morning as well if you're a person who use cleanses um most of the time i just rinse my face with water so i'm gonna rinse that off have mascara of course don't forget to take your mascara off and sometimes depending on what routine i'm doing i will leave my face wet and then i will go with my moisturizer straight on top of my wet face just to benefit from that moisture that is already on my skin then i'm going to do a little spritz of serious ink um this is a zinc sulfate solution it is amazingly soothing and calming for your skin zinc is a really great ingredient if you have rosacea and it comes in this really big bottle from la roche posay and it has a beautiful big like fine mist so there we go it's a little bit salty on the lips because of the sink and i just let this dry i just let the sink in give it a moment brush my teeth brush my hair do something like this so i'm going to give it a little second to dry before we move on to serums but while i'm here i want to show you a mask to dig into my drawers i'm not going to do this mask today but this mask when my skin is extra irritated and extra red and i just need that luxurious calming soothing cooling feel on my skin this is what i reach for it is pricey but there's also um nothing like it out there i know quite a few have been hooked on this since i have mentioned it years ago behind because i have been using it for years now and it's the shantikai jasmine and lily mask healing mask this has vitamin b5 it's got chamomile and mimosa and it's soothing it's softening it's calming and it just feels so good on your skin so i definitely recommend having a look if you want maybe to request a present maybe there's an occasion coming up and somebody can gift it to you or you can gift it to yourself as always i will be leaving all the links to all the items that i have mentioned in description box below i have some discount codes for some uh products as well so check the description box before you make any purchases but at the same time don't think this video is sponsored because it is not at all this is purely from my personal experience so we're going to move on to serums and treatments and i use two serums at the moment that have active ingredients one is hyaluronic acid and another one is colostrum colostrum gel is an amazing amazing ingredient unfortunately it's not vegan if you are vegan um and it is amazing to rebuild the barrier of your skin and to strengthen your skin so these has been amazing this is from environ um and byron is one of those brands that you have to look for a stockist to buy their stuff but there are quite a few now online otherwise we have a few um salons and shops that actually stock them so usually i go there uh and hyaluronic acid of course is hydration we want that hydration even if you have oily skin this is a misconception about having oily skin and not wanting to put moisture in a lot of the time your skin is oily because it's dehydrated that is the funny thing about it so i apply two different ones in different areas um different days sometimes i alternate them sometimes i put them on the same time when it comes to hyaluronic acid i either use mylar shape posse this is the hyalu b5 so it's got the b5 vitamin as well or the good molecules hyaluronic acid fantastic to just draw moisture into your skin and then for colostrum i apply one pump into my fingers it's like this funny brown color and then i just massage it into the area of concern so it's got um almost a little bit of a gritty consistency some vitamin c serums have that this doesn't have as much of it um but it's definitely it's not that smooth like i always think that it's not very smooth so i applied all my cheeks and all my temples so this is where i get most of my redness and then on the rest of the face and sometimes on top i will apply my chlorinic acid so i'm going to go with the good molecule ones today it doesn't really matter they're both really really good um a clear gel like a watery gel so i'm gonna apply that on my forehead on my chin jewel line around the lips for neck and chest i also forgot to mention in the morning that if i don't use the lower shape as a moisturizer i use the cerave moisturizer this is the facial moisturizing lotion this has spf 25 and it's fragrance free it's non-comedogenic it's very affordable and it's got ceramides too again again we're talking about that barrier of the skin but also it's just essential to wear spf if you have sensitive skin but even if you don't and even if it's not summer even if it's not sunny you've got to wear your spf so that's my serums on again give it a second to sink in give your products a chance to work their magic before you slap something else on then we're going into moisturizer and two moisturizers on the go at the moment in the evening it's the tolerian taurian the one that i showed you in the morning and the one that i used in the morning or the aurilia cell revitalize night moisturizer this is so deeply nourishing so if you feel like you want that extra hydration to be honest both of them are super super nourishing so it's purely up to you um i love aurilia as you can see it's got that really nice thick consistency so i'm going to apply that one tonight i alternate them um i like to switch my routine around which sometimes doesn't play out well because i end up using something that i got excited about and purchased and it just doesn't suit my skin but it's all trial and error so i'm gonna apply the this one today it smells again amazing everything from aurelia has that element of aromatherapy to it again don't forget about the neck i take about a pea size amount of cream um for the moisturizer and that my friends is it that is me done for the night so i'm gonna leave the creams to do their magic another thing that i use and that i have been enjoying is an led mask you might have seen it in my favorites video mine is from current body so it's an led silicone mask so you just put it on your face like that and then you press the button and the red light therapy starts so i usually do it every other day i just press the button and for 10 minutes i close my eyes and listen to my audio book and do absolutely nothing at all because i can and it's because it's good for me sorry i'm reaching for my lip balm because i can feel how dry my lips are i use elizabeth are then eight hour cream and the led therapy has been fantastic it is fantastic if you have acne if you're fighting fine lines and wrinkles and pretty much any skin concern led light can address of course it is not as strong as you will get in a salon but it is pretty damn good and pretty damn close as far as home uh equipment and home therapies go so i would definitely have a look at the current body one and or there's another one that is very similar that has um similar strength in the light otherwise if you guys have any questions at all please let me know i will leave all the information about all the projects that i have used today in the description box i hope you enjoyed this video and i hope if you do suffer from rosacea that it is not too bad today or tomorrow and i know how frustrating it can be but i wish you all a wonderful day i'm sending you all my love and i hope you are doing well don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you haven't done that yet and i will see you guys very very soon in my next video bye of course only by the end of the video do i realize i've got mascara all over my eyes this is what a wonderful youtuber i am",

        "transcript": "April is rosacea awareness a month and for those of you who know me in the channel you know that I've posted a lot about my struggles with rosacea some of the products that I've used to help overcome it and I say overcome it kind of loosely um I've come to terms with it I recognize what my triggers are I understand better how to maintain My Skin Barrier and most importantly focus on the treatments and medications that give me the best outcome for my skin I will say rosacea is definitely a marathon and not a Sprint as is most things with skin care there's rarely an overnight success or magic treatment that's gonna solve all your skin issues no matter what they are but certainly that's the case with rosacea at least that's been my experience while I have my rosacea pretty much under control I still have flare-ups I still have irritation I still kind of regress backwards so I just wanted to kind of sit back relax and do a little bit of an update video for you on how my rosacea my skin is doing now and what I attribute My Success to my skin in at its lowest point look like this but you can see now I specifically for today's video I'm not wearing any foundation BB cream CC cream I chose a tinted mineral sunscreen it's really new to me it was sent to me in PR it's naked Sunday's tinted mineral sunscreen I like the tinted mineral sunscreens of course because they offset the white cast overall my skin is just so much better than it was not to say that I don't still have flare-ups I do especially when I ignore my triggers which I know full well what they are red wine which sucks because I love red wine spicy foods also sucks I love spicy foods and my husband likes to cook spicy foods so yeah sometimes I have to suffer through the aftermath with my skin and the sun it's very hard to avoid the Sun but I do my best to mitigate that so I will wear a hat when I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time and I always always wear a daily sunscreen my view on sunscreen is honestly just find one you love and you use that speaking of setbacks recently I was traveling staying in a hotel room you know the air is different in the hotel room I was drinking red wine with dinner the climate was slightly different you can see on my face here how my rosacea flares and it's almost immediately so as much as I try to control my triggers and set the situation to be optimal for Success it still happens I'll tell you what I did in my story and hopefully you can just extrapolate from that something that may be useful for you of course you should be in consultation with a medical professional I'm not that I'm simply here to share with you my story and my experience so that hopefully it can arm you with some more information and help you along the way if nothing else to know you're not alone the Hallmarks on my rosacea is an impaired barrier Associated redness and flushing irritation inflammation and pimples back when it was at its worst this is what I did I stopped everything in my skincare routine basically put myself on a skincare diet I I went back to the very basics of cleansing and moisturizing my skin and when it comes to Cleansing just choose a cleanser that's very gentle and hydrating that's what worked for me I've used this Cetaphil Vana cream was one of my favorites uh this one by avino continues to be one of my favorites it's their common restore line and I wanted to call out this one this is the glucoside foaming cleanser and while this is a new launch from the ordinary I've been really enjoying this product for my skin my children have been using it too and they also have very sensitive skin it was tested on babies originally and it's just been a really lovely cleanser so back then when I was at my worst I wish I would have had something like this too I've also used cerave's hydrating cleanser it's really just about finding the one that works best for you within your price point I only cleanse my skin at night with a cleanser in the morning I use water only this is one of the ways I was able to keep my barrier intact the cleansing process just seemed to be too much for my skin if I was doing it morning and night so that was really a game changer for me for moisturizers I like to offer something that's rich in ceramides and that is a little bit occlusive to lock that moisture into the skin because one of the Hallmarks of rosacea is a damaged Skin Barrier it has trouble holding and retaining that moisture into the skin so if you can do that with your moisturizer you're ahead of the game so cerave's moisturizing lotion is a great one love regimen Labs cream this is their second iteration of this particular product they've actually improved the consistency and the applicability of this on the skin it's far less thick and more spreadable I'd say on the skin and this one's fabulous because it has ceramides as does the CeraVe one it's a higher price point for this but I just really love this brand for a gel type moisturizer going back to Aveeno this common restore line has just been really good for my skin I love this it's drugstore so it's readily accessible and great for my combination skin sometimes I don't want a thick Rich moisturizer this can be great in the morning and a thicker richer cream in the evening is sometimes what I opt for but another new launch from the ordinary they've improved or added to their natural moisturizing factors line and this one is their natural moisturizing factors plus phytoceramides so again just adding more ceramides into the formulation making this a really good moisturizer for rosacea in my opinion and also for those of you with dry skin when it comes to daily sunscreen my opinion just find one that works for you whether it's chemical mineral hybrid whatever it is tinted non-tinted cheap expensive if you're gonna put it on your face every day go with that one I'm being facetious because sometimes sunscreen can be irritating to some and you want to find the one that best suits your skin I've actually created a shop my which really lists the products that are my favorites by category those are affiliate links so you don't have to purchase through through those just look at what the products are and then you can Google and purchase on your own because otherwise I make a very small commission if you purchase from those links so if you want to great and thank you if you don't totally fine as well but the point is to be able to share with you what my favorites are by genre so I'll link my favorites below for my sunscreen category so you can take a look through there ask me specific questions in the comments if you have about any particular product all of the ones that are listed there are ones that have worked for my skin so I hope you find that helpful I did want to call it this product that came to me in PR this is by Dr jard it's your secret pair tiger grass Camp drops they're really neat and it's green looks kind of gross but if you know the color wheel green offsets or neutralizes red now this is an SPF 35 but I actually use this kind of more like makeup and then it's just giving me that additional sun protection so I apply whatever sunscreen I'm wearing wearing for the day and then I put a few drops of this over top and it really neutralizes the red so I'm kind of almost using it like makeup as opposed to sunscreen but definitely impressed with this product for me Beyond getting a basic skincare routine in place and focusing on restoring and repairing My Skin Barrier without adding in any active ingredients like retinoids and vitamin Cs and acids and all that stuff just keeping it to the basics I also needed medical intervention so at the time I was prescribed this which is metrogel this is an antibiotic gel often used for people who struggle with rosacea I can say that this was definitely responsible for getting my rosacea under control in that kind of acute flare-up phase that I was in once My Skin Barrier was intact and things were calmed down settled down that's when I could reintroduce the active ingredients into my skincare routine such as my vitamin C retinoids Etc so just because I have rosacea doesn't mean that I can't capitalize on those things it's just sometimes I have to opt for versions that are more sensitive skin friendly and when I have a flare-up I kind of revert back to the basics again just to be sure my Skin's under control before I reintroduce those active ingredients in my skincare routines the next thing and it's no surprise for those of you who have watched my channel for a while it's the thing that I actually attribute my kind of ongoing success with my rosacea is azelic acid I feel like it is really responsible for keeping my rosacea obey and maintaining My Skin Barrier overall I have used over-the-counter acelaic acid serums for years and I can say some of my favorites are Paula's Choice 10 azoleic acid booster and this one by theramid it's their acid or azid I'm not sure how it's pronounced but this one's at 15 azaleaic acid I was impressed with this one because it's actually the same percentage of azelic acid as my prescription and strength osoletic acid and I fairly recently started this prescription phenacea finessia tomato tomato I'm not sure but it's a 15 prescription only here in Canada as oleic acid now the different approach I've had with this one versus the other ones is that I was normally using those once a day generally in my morning skincare routine paired with my vitamin C but I've been using this one now for about six weeks twice a day morning and evening skincare routine it's another reason I love this as a product azelic acid it pairs well with so many other things it really doesn't have conflicts you don't have to worry about it I use it in my evening skincare routine paired with my retinoid in my morning skincare routine pair with my vitamin C the only thing I don't do is I don't put it in the same routine as my acid day when I use my aha or Alpha hydroxy acid it's once a week and I just focus on the acid and hydrating skin care products to surround that routine I'm only six weeks into this sort of regime so I will definitely do an update for you later on but already I am reaping the benefits of this overall I can feel that my skin is just more calm and healthy azelic acid has so many health benefits for the skin especially for rosacea it works to decrease the swelling the associated redness but is really effective at targeting the bacteria that's in the pores that can also contribute to the pimples associated with rosacea making this also a great product or great ingredient for those of you with acne prone skin of course there can be Associated side effects I think primarily those are tingling stinging and even drawing of the skin I personally haven't had that experience so I'd love to hear from those of you who perhaps have had that experience you can share that in the comments section below but certainly if you're using a prescription nasolic acid you'd be in consultation with a medical professional and of course they'd be able to talk to you more about that but if you're using OTC or over-the-counter azoleic acids just be aware you're experiencing that as well I will continue to monitor my rosacea with you and I'll do more updates as we go along and just see how my journey goes because I'm hoping it's helping you to understand more about the disease and spreading awareness which is what the April rosacea awareness month is all about I'll drop some information on that in particular below I would really really love it if you would share your thoughts experiences comments in the comments section below if you haven't watched them already be sure to watch these videos up on screen and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video I'm going to share with you a simple straightforward effective skincare routine for clearing up blackheads white heads acne breakouts and for rosacea and that really stubborn cousin of rosacea perioral dermatitis this is a really easy routine anybody can do it doesn't require a lot of advanced thinking planning layering give this video a thumbs up if you like simple straightforward No Nonsense skincare routines that don't require like a lot of advanced thinking planning tons of products cluttering your shell I'm going to be using one of my favorite ingredients it's very underrated it's sulfur in the de la Cru maximum strength acne treatment this is a 10% sulfur mask I'm going to show you how to use it and while I do it I'm going to explain how it works what the benefits are and what to expect you want to get started by first washing your face you can just use a mild gentle cleanser I'm using this one by Neutrogena a favorite of mine the hydroboost with hyaluronic acid hydrating Gel Cleanser fragrance-free importantly when you wash your face always make sure to use lukewarm to Cool Water using really hot water not only can dry out the skin but actually can be really aggravating to conditions like rosacea and perioral dermatitis you want to make sure to pat dry the skin if your skin is soaking wet this product is probably not going to set up as as well now that my skin is clean and there's no water residue left on the surface this product is going to go on a lot more evenly a lot more smoothly to use this you just need about a pearl sized amount and you're going to apply a thin film to the face now I'm going to put it to my entire face sparing around my eyes common mistake people make when it comes to Skin Care is putting on a big glob all you really need is a very thin film of this it has a very moisturizing texture make sure to get my nose cheek area so as soon as you've applied this in a thin film to the entire face sparing the area around your eyes you're going to set a timer for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes I'll go ahead and do 15 while the timer is going we're going to talk about what what exactly this is doing what it's helpful for what to expect sulfur why would you want to use that in a skincare routine it has a lot of benefits for the skin if you weren't aware it's anti-inflammatory and it's antimicrobial it can help reduce the acne causing bacteria cutie bacterium acnes and it can also help control certain microbes on the skin surface that can aggravate conditions like rosacea your skin has these little mites hello kind of freaks people out they're called Demodex mites but in Ros part of the skin problem where you get these inflamed red spots is thought to be due to an abnormal response to those little mites and sulfur can actually help with that sulfur is also chotic meaning it basically unclogs pores it does this because the sulfur is thought to interact with cysteine the amino acid and the keratins in your skin helping to basically break up the glue between cells that are kind of stuck together in your pore the benefit of doing that is unclogging pores so you can see Improvement in blackheads and white heads otherwise known as open and closed comeone so for example if you get a lot of Comey dones on your forehead this may help you out if you get a lot of blackheads on your nose this is something to consider because sulfur is both anti-inflammatory and because it can help reduce the burden of the acne causing bacterium cutie bacterium acnes this can be a particularly valuable mask to consider incorporating into your skincare routine if you have acne whether it be acne that is predominant L hormonal maybe predominantly localized to the jawline maybe you have comedonal acne that's aggravated by hair styling products on your forehead and you're trying to clear that up or maybe you have acne on your body like your chest or your back you don't have to just do this to the face this product can help with those things sulfur is really underrated by and large some of the things I really like about sulfur and this mask in particular are that it's pretty easy to tolerate it's very gentle on the skin I mean it's well tolerated by by people who have the sensitive skin condition rosacea I also like that this product can be used alongside other treatments what we're doing here in this routine is essentially a form of short contact therapy what is short contact therapy essentially what it sounds like putting an active ingredient on the skin leaving it there for a defined period of time and then rinsing it off the advantages of short contact therapy are that you get the ingredient on the skin you derive the benefits but you minimize any side effects of dryness that's what we're doing here I've got a lot of videos talking about short contact therapy on this channel whether it be with troan or other acne ingredients like benzol peroxide so check those out but today we're basically doing a form of short contact therapy in contrast to some of those other active ingredients that we've talked about with short contact therapy though I want to emphasize that sulfur is pretty gentle on the skin it's actually kind of soothing the main side effects of using the sulfur mask are it can be drying some people find their skin itches when they use it and probably the thing that bothers people the most is the odor some people find that it smells like rotting eggs other people note that it smells like a match head basically the smell of sulfur now we're going to rinse this off the skin surface in my opinion I don't smell any residual sulfur odor using this product after I rinse it off but I have gotten comments over the years from people who are like I use that and every time I use it my husband or partner they tell me that my face smells like eggs so just a word of warning it can leave a foul odor on the skin surface that a lot of people don't care for but as I mentioned you can use it alongside other active ingredients it doesn't counteract other active ingredients and because it's relatively gentle overall I mean it may be a little drying but overall it's pretty gentle you can use it alongside other active ingredients for either acne rosacea perioral dermatitis for example in the case of acne you could use this mask rinse it off as we're going to do in a moment and you'll see see me do that you can rinse it off and then you can use your other acne treatments whether it be bzal peroxide troin aoic acid um topical dapsone you can also use treatments for rosacea along with this whether be topical icin which is sold by the brand named cilantro or topical metronidazol this is not going to get in the way of that it's gentle enough that you can actually do this on a daily basis comment below have you ever dealt with a bout of peroral dermatitis otherwise known as per orificial dermatitis it can be very frustrating and uncomfortable as the name implies often involves the skin around the mouth although it can involve the skin around the nose and around the eyes periorificial dermatitis is notoriously difficult to tackle head on and majority of skincare products actually end up irritating that condition but sulfur is something that is prudent to consider in the routine to address that condition again it is thought to be related to rosace the anti-inflammatory properties of sulfur are what is thought to be responsible for improvement in periorificial dermatitis with sulfur so in summary benefits that you might observe with a product like this are fewer breakouts fewer blackheads fewer white heads in the case of rosacea fewer papules which are those red bumps fewer pules which are those white pus fill bumps similarly with periorificial dermatitis you may note Improvement in the number of red bumps that you get with that condition and an overall just Improvement in the sensitivity that you experience with those little bumps if you've ever had that again those bumps they can sting and be really uncomfortable what if you don't have acne rosacea or periorificial dermatitis can this still be helpful certainly can it's chotic properties can help improve the appearance of pores does this have any anti-aging properties to it no there's nothing about this that combats skin aging how often can you do this mask you can do it as often as you tolerate it you actually can do it on a daily basis either as part of your morning skincare routine or part of your evening skincare routine and truthfully if you're motivated you can do it two to three times a day as tolerated so what I suggest is that try using it once a day for the first couple of weeks see how you do with it if it's too drying maybe go to using it every other day but if you tolerate it fine consider increasing it to using it twice a day by increasing the number of times a day that you use it you may note that that you get a faster onset of improvement of things like red bumps pules blackheads and white heads again everything in the skin takes time but by increasing the frequency as tolerated you may know that you get to those results faster than doing it at a more conservative Pace now if you'll recall from my video on short contact therapy one of the things I really like about it is that it gives the individual a lot of control and tweaking the duration of contact you can start out really conservative leaving this on on the skin surface for 10 minutes and then increase the duration of contact you may find that initially you only tolerate wearing it for 10 minutes and that it's too drying but with time you are able to tolerate it better outwards to 15 and 20 minutes and then again increasing from just using it once a day a few times a week to daily to twice a day I mean really it's going to be something that you can guide people who have drier skin maybe are more sensitive those that tend to be more on the rosaceous side of things they may find they have to be more conservative whereas people who have really inflamed acne they may find that they need to be a bit more aggressive and use it more frequently the spots of acne they can be quite thickened and so the penetration of this can be a little slow in those areas so by using it more frequently you may get to the end point that you're looking for faster okay now that the 15 minutes are up I'm going to rinse this off the skin surface something really nice about this product is you don't don't need to use cleanser to rinse it off the skin it's water soluble meaning it'll come off with water now you certainly can use a gentle cleanser if you find that that works for you I would suggest though just using water because the more times you wash your face with a cleanser that can end up drying out your skin too much and as I said sulfur can be a little drying to begin with and again cool to lukewarm water we're not going to go boiling the stratum corium here all right so now that I've rinse that off we're going to come in with the final step of this very simple straightforward routine and that is to apply a moisturizer if this is part of your evening routine or a moisturizing sunscreen if this is part of your daytime routine doesn't matter what the product is so long as you like it and it doesn't bother your skin I'm using the hadot amuji skin conditioning gel by nuturi this is a really lightweight hydrating gel it's beneficial in that it's going to replenish any moisture that I lost from washing my face and it's going to help keep the Skin Barrier protected and hydrated to minimize any potential drying side effects from The sulfur mask with moisturizer you only need a nickel to Dime sized amount again you don't need a big glob on there of course it's going to depend a bit on the consistency of the moisturizer that you're using so you can always add a little bit more if you feel that you need to but you don't need to go on in with a big glob from the get-go it just will end up wasting things now if I were doing this as part of my morning routine I would pat dry the skin completely and I would come in with a moisturizing sunscreen if you guys missed my video on the pure screen Plus Mineral tinted sunscreens from Neutrogena definitely check those out but these would be a great option if you have especially if you have very sensitive skin they're mineral sunscreens they're less likely to sting and burn in comparison to the All chemical sunscreen and you have four different shades to choose from there so that would be a great option okay where do you get this Dayla Cru sulfur oy you can get it a lot of places it can be a little hard to find cuz they sometimes put it like down at the bottom shelf but you can buy it at Walmart you can buy it at Kroger grocery stores I've seen uh Target you can also get it at like Walgreens r a CVS or you can get it on the Amazonian so it's pretty inexpensive and you don't need a lot of this you also as I mentioned earlier in the video You could also use this product to like the chest the back anywhere where you have breakouts this could be used and it can be helpful it can be used under the arms too if you find that you get painful breakouts there maybe related to hyro adenitis you may find that this is beneficial in those areas it can be very soothing and anti-inflammatory can this product be used if you were pregnant always discuss that with your treating healthcare provider but by and large sulfur is is considered to be safe to use in pregnancy can you use a sulfur mask if you are allergic to sulfa s u LFA the answer is yes sulfur is not the same as sulfa sulfa is a class of antibiotics that some people are allergic to but this does not crossreact with that okay I'm going to wrap this video up here I really hope that this was helpful to you guys straightforward effective three-step routine for acne rosacea paroral dermatitis really anyone could benefit from this routine if you're looking to incorporate sulfur in for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits um now on the end slate I'm going to link my video on how to do short contact therapy with benzo peroxide it's a great way to use benzol peroxide for your acne derive the benefits of that ingredient but minimize the drying effects benzo peroxide in contrast to sulfur can be a lot more drying and irritating so watch that one next especially if you're coping with acne breakouts but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] h [Music]",

        "transcript": "Hi how are you another rosacea video today and I thought we could go into what needs to be in your everyday routine if you're managing redness or Rosa just a quick reminder because sometimes with Rosa videos I find that they reach people that maybe haven't met me before I'm Rose I'm a beauty journalist I was diagnosed with Rosa six years ago and everything I share in these Rosa videos is information that consultant dermatologists have told me I'm not going to mention specific products today I want to give you um rules and ideas of what to use so for example like moisturizer is going to be one of them and looking for a moisturizer that helps to strengthen the Skin Barrier I will do separate videos with product recommendations but the reason I wanted to do something neutral today largely is so that if I'm mentioning something that you can't get for whatever reason maybe is out of your budget you don't like the brand whatever the criteria could be this is more to tell you what should sit in your routines that you can do your own research and find things that work for you so all of that said let's talk about your routine the great thing about redness and Rose ASA is that the simplest routines are actually the most effective in helping to manage it so all I would recommend in the first instance for you is a great cleanser twice a day a great moisturizer twice a day and an SF from here it can be really helpful to incorporate a treatment stick so for me for example I've got type one and type two rosacea so I have persistent flushing and then I also sometimes have red texture and bumps um it kind of looks a bit like spots it can be confused with spots but how you would know that texture is more of a rosacea texture than an acne texture is that acne spots tend to come to a head whether that's a white head or a black head whereas rosacea spots tend to be just angry red bumps so for me my treatment step that works really well for me is azelaic acid that's a really great ingredient to help reduce the appearance of that redness and I find with the right strength aalc acid I can see a reduction in texture in literally a matter of days so even though that would maybe be your next step it would be something that I would really recommend if you're particularly struggling with your skin let's start with moisturizer now with red or Ros acia prone skin you can find that the skin is also tight or uncomfortable um maybe feels really dry so moisturizer is a really important thing that will help to keep your skin more comfortable now crucially a lot of those symptoms can come from a compromised or irritated skin barrier so when your Skin Barrier is really healthy if I could do this a little analogy for you this Skin Barrier is going to lock moisture in it's going to prevent anything from getting into the skin like irritants pollution dirt and everything's going to sit really nicely but a compromised Skin Barrier looks like this and so all of those irritants can get in moisture can get out and you can notice an increase in things like the redness and sensitivity so ideally your moisturizer that you're going to use twice a day is going to have ingredients in there that help to strengthen the Skin Barrier which in turn is going to make your skin feel more comfortable less tight less dry you're going to see less redness it's going to have a huge knock on effect when it comes to your moisturizer ingredients like ceramides are brilliant for helping to manage rosacea um a nice rich formula can often be quite helpful because a lot of that dryness will respond well to that however everyone's skin is different if you find that you have maybe a more oily skin you can get lovely gel consistencies that will be just as good as at repairing the Skin Barrier ultimately I would say as well try and look for something that's as simple as possible if you want to add active ingredients to your routine you could add those in elsewhere separately if it was me I would look for your moisturizer to really just focus on the Skin Barrier and moisturizing the skin all of that said I'm a huge believer in everyone's skin is different and the number one thing I would say is just carry on with whatever is working for you now the next one is SPF that I would say is crucial to wear every single day here here the thing with SPF everything you read or any dermatologist will tell you it is the most important thing to use every day we all know this however if I could just put it to you another way the other thing that's crucial to remember with SPF is that wearing it every day will reduce the appearance of your redness the sun is one of the biggest triggers of rosacea and it will literally cause your skin to flush and look more red in lots and lots of people so when you wear your SPF not not only are you protecting your skin from the raise of the sun pollutants irritants you know it's every single Derm as well will tell you if you're hoping to achieve a healthy aging and look as great as you can at any age it's the number one thing that you should be using but in terms of redness it's a very crucial step in helping to keep your skin really calm so if that if you're not using it every day let that be a little motivation that it is really worthwhile to use and then your cleanser now with cleansers I personally think this is a really important step to get right when you have redness or rosacea it's really important as the name would suggest to clean your skin that's great however lots of cleansers are rich and moisturizing and have ingredients in them that again are going to further support that Skin Barrier if you are in the very early days of managing your rosacea I would honestly recommend using a cream cleanser something really gentle massage it off with your hands when I come to do a cleanser video I'll go into more detail I'm not one of these do as I say not as I do I deviate from that sometimes I will use soft cloths I will sometimes use a balm um I've mixed and matched over the years and I've found what works for me but in the early days if you're thinking of making tweaks to your routine to keep things really comfortable cream cleanser no cloth you can get cream cleansers that will take all of your eye makeup off and everything um you will see a world of difference to how hydrated your skin feels and also when your skin is really nicely cleansed all of those other things are going to work well alongside it and then finally your treatment step this is where you're maybe going to have ingredients that aren't necessarily available over the counter that are really going to Target repairing and helping to reduce the appearance of that redness what I would say to you in this instance is seek medical attention luckily there are loads of online resources now that you can use I will make another video on these but on the top of my head I want to tell you about the boots online doctor where you send photos in of your skin and then they can make a prescription for you that they think is most appropriate and you just pay for that prescription there's skin and me which is an online pharmacy prescribed service where you can have a formula made for your with active ingredients that you wouldn't be able to buy over the counter that they can formulate with that will help to Target the redness or clearer that's what I'm currently using at the moment that is a dermatologist design service of the same nature where you fill out a huge questionnaire they will make a bespoke formula to treat your skin and you use it in harmony with all of those other steps but you will see a huge difference because it's been made to really Target what is going on on your skin now there are other things you might want want to add in your active ingredients vitamin C for example for radiance we'll go into all of that in a further video but for now those Basics your moisturizer SPF cleanser and a treatment step are the first things I'd really prioritized to keeping your skin as calm as possible I've got nothing on my skin today by the way if you want to have a little look um mine is kind of playing ball really well at the moment got a few little uh broken veins there that I might think about having some laser for really considered did that before but I am starting to think about it now so if I do that I can absolutely keep you posted there's a Top Line I want to keep these videos really easy to dip in and out of so I'm going to leave it there I'll go into more detail about all of those categories with product recommendations in another video if you've got any questions please feel free to leave them here and I'll talk to you soon take care",

        "transcript": "- It's literally been forever\nsince I've done a video. Hi guys, I'm Ross. Thank you, Adore, for having me. My video's for anyone that has rosacea, redness in the skin, high coloring, problematic skin, sensitive\nskin, you name it. If your skin feels it when you put some skincare on, and it starts tingling, it doesn't work, it's not working for you, I'm just gonna show you a\nroutine that works for me, AM and PM. When you have rosacea, or you have a skin condition that just is so sensitive, sometimes you're totally\nfine for six months, can be totally fine for a year and out of nowhere your\nskin just tells you that it's no longer good, no longer good for you. The first step is to make\nsure you use a cleanser. The cleanser I'm using at the moment is a Dermalogica cleanser, which is the soothing\nand calming cleanser, which I'm gonna grab. Just dampening my face. (water splashing) I just damped my face, damped my face, wetted my face, my face is wet. I'm using the UltraCalming cleanser. I did watch James the other day, James Vivian said that\nyou do have to cleanse for two minutes. I don't know if I've got\ntwo minutes to do this, I don't know if I spend\ntwo minutes cleansing, but this cleanser is\nbeautiful on the skin, it feels gorgeous on the face, it doesn't make my skin react, and it doesn't make it tight afterwards. Sometimes when you've got rosacea, or you've got sensitive\nskin you can use it then afterwards your\nskin goes really tight, and you get loads of lovely flaky bits. I'm not sure that was two\nminutes, sorry James, babe. That's what I've got in me to do that, right, I'm going to the sink. The big reveal, all bare, you can actually see my rosacea, so really red nose. Always in the summer, everybody's like \"Oh, you've\ngot a bit of sun there.\" And I'm like, \"No, that's just my nose.\" But, it's like a map of England, so usually it comes up here, down here, in here, and then I get, you can\nsee all the redness here, I get the dry, flakiness all in here. Done a podcast with the girls in Beauty iQ how I try to cover up my\nrosacea using foundation. But usually my boyfriend\ncalls me a lamington, Australian lamington because\nI get all the flaky bits start coming here. But this skincare routine\nis working for me right now. So, once I've cleansed, I'm going to use a serum. The one I'm using in the AM at the moment is the Osmosis one, it's quite boujee, but it's working. This is the Rescue serum, I'm using a pump and a half of that. This feels lovely, and this is just gonna repair the skin. Smells quite earthy, it's there to calm the\nskin and soothe the skin, that's what I need when I'm going to work, I don't need anything on\nthere that's aggravating it. But you can see there just, yeah, I'm happy, and you can instantly see hydrating, and crows feet don't look as dry but nice, nice and plump. Then, for my everyday,\nLa Roche-Posay Toleriane is a really gorgeous, everyday moisturizer which is just great for anyone that has super sensitive skin. If you're me, I will literally\njust use this moisturizer, and then I'll just probably go straight on with an SPF, and then I'll whack on my foundation. Make sure you put a tiny\nbit of moisturizer on, and then you get your SPF. I don't use a primer, I'm\nvery naughty like that. So, I go on with an anthelios, or an ultra-violet, get that SPF 50. Actually looks all right, not bad with no foundation on actually. Okay, so I've cleansed, and now I'm gonna share with you my night routine. My night routine is, it's not even that complicated. I think my whole makeup, beauty routine is never complicated, I literally use two foundations\nand that's about it. For my night routine, I'm gonna use a SkinCeuticals, which is phyto green corrective gel. You take one to two drops of this, maybe I take three, and this is great 'cause\nlike anti-inflammatory, antiseptic it said as well, and this is great, you put it on your areas that really aggravate you, and for me it's always\nthe center of my face. I have got it checked out, and I've been told to drink ginger tea and licorice tea, and I'm sure all of us out there that we've tried all sorts of things to kind of calm our rosacea, but nothing really works. So that, I put on the SkinCeuticals and you can use that down your neck, you can use it on your hand, you can use it anywhere, anywhere you feel that you're\nhaving a flare up is great. So I don't know if you have it, but you do a bit of\nthis throughout the day, 'cause you know that your skin's nipping, or it's itching, or I tend to do a lot of this, because I don't want\nmy foundation to move, or pressing, then when I get in from\nwork that's the first thing, that I take my makeup off, whack that on, and hopefully it will calm it down. Then I go on with a moisturizer. I don't even know how\nto pronounce that name, mesoestetic, (mumbling), can you see it? And basically, this is gorgeous, smells a bit like tonka bean, like freshly baked cakes. It's there to renew your skin, and provide strength to your cells. It's actually gorgeous, it's really gorgeous, smells beautiful. There is a special technology within this, really good for any of\nus that have rosacea, and I would literally just\nput this on before bed, I think it looks lovely. And considering I've\ngot a nice, rosy face, it doesn't nip, doesn't tingle, we're always gonna live with rosacea, or sensitive skin, I suppose it's just using skincare that works for you, and rosacea flares up\nif you have spicy food, if you've been out in the sun, if you haven't had enough sleep, if you're stressed out, it really just does come alive. Even when you're thinking something, and you might get a bit anxious, sometimes my rosacea starts nipping, and starts kind of coming out. There's like five key products that I use, this is working perfect\nfor my skin right now. So, guys, if you like this video, please hit subscribe, like, ring the bell. Thank you so much, Adore, for having me, all my love to anybody out there that has rosacea, sensitive\nskin, problematic skin, you name it, skin that screams when you put certain skincare on it, this is my happy recipe for you. All right then, thank you\nso much for watching, guys, (kissing) take care, bye. (upbeat music)",

        "transcript": "hi everybody and welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel if you have been here before today i'm going to be sharing my morning and nighttime skincare routine when it comes to mild rosacea so i haven't done this in a while i haven't sat down and shared my full skincare with you and because my skincare is kind of ever-changing i constantly add new products i do have my ride or die a little lineup that i use all the time but recently my skin has been going or through some changes i had a cold sore that was so bad and it took me weeks and weeks and weeks to heal it and hence i couldn't um couldn't really record any massages or the buckle massage that i keep promising you which will come after this video because i am going to film it today or tomorrow um but uh then i had some hormonal breakouts because um there were some changes with that as well no i'm not pregnant i will let you know when i am but otherwise i have been getting quite um big flare-ups of rosacea on my cheeks i get rosacea purely because of the food that i eat the stress and um there are lots of different factors that contribute to rosacea and rosacea really shows itself up by when the vessels the in your skin get bigger and the inflammation comes through usually it's around the cheeks but a lot of people actually don't know that they have rosacea because um they think they have acne and they can very much present themselves in very similar ways you can get little bumps on your cheeks that have little white heads you will see little capillaries and almost like broken capillaries on your skin of course you will have flushing there are so many different ways it can show up but there are also other things that show up that way you might just be reactive to spicy food or you might get flushed easily you know you can get redness in your cheeks depending on so many different aspects so um it's very much kind of an observation kind of situation you have to observe your skin a good idea as well is if you really want to understand your skin and your skin type is to keep a diary so what you have eaten what have you used what happened today with your skin how is it looking how is it feeling how are you feeling how much water have you drank and then you will see different effects that your skin might have so today my skin is pretty good because i have been using kind of a routine that i stuck to and my rosacea definitely got much better um this is still kind of healing because hormonal breakouts always take so long to heal i have been very good i haven't touched them but you know the scars will still take ages to heal and because i haven't really used acids and anything like that anything harsh recently because i've been clearing out the redness on my cheeks um that is why i haven't been able to fade the acne scars as much but i do use um kind of like local um local acids to get rid of those acne scars to resurface the skin so i'm going to talk you through my morning routine and this is not just for rosacea but if you do get redness in your cheeks if you have sensitivity in your skin this is a great way to build up the barrier and to moisturize and protect your skin i have already showered and cleansed my face and the cleanser that i'm using at the moment is the cerave hydrating cleanser this is for normal to dry skin comes with a pump super affordable it's kind of like a nice milky cleanser that looks like this and then it's low foaming i would say it does foam up a little bit but it's very good to um to use it if you don't wear a lot of makeup so it will kind of emolliate like this i will now have to go and wash my hands but it's very good to use in the morning if you do want to cleanse your face or just use water a lot of times i will just use water this is the cleanser that i kind of use morning and evening at the moment but i will show you in the evening another cleanser that i really like and use but this one is definitely um cerave in general because they have ceramides it's really really good to rebuild and re-strengthen the barrier of your skin then we're going to move into toner and the toner that i'm using at the moment is good molecules neocinamide brightening toner niacinamide is essentially a vitamin b3 and it is very good for hydration and also protecting your skin from kind of um environmental damage and it also helps with enlarged pores so what i do i just put a couple of drops into my hand it has almost a little bit of a thicker consistency than a normal toner and then i just press it into my skin everywhere and my neck and my chest like always remember this is the whole unit this is this is one um it doesn't come like this and then like that this is all one because the skin on your neck and your chest is very similar to your face so it will show signs of aging the same way okay so i really like this one again very affordable brand good molecules glass bottle dark glass bottle which is really nice and it's got vitamin c as well in it so it's nice to use in the morning if you're using spf but we will get to that and then we're going to go into a serum and this serum is one of the like the key main products um in my routine that i have introduced to reduce the inflammation and the redness and it's from face theory as a clear a15 serum so this is 15 azalea acid it also has um collodial oat aloe vera and green tea so azealic acid is a natural occurring acid and it is amazing at killing bacteria that causes acne and it causes rosacea so this has been fantastic to use it comes in a pump again a glass bottle so i just take a little pump it's like a liquidy white fluid and then i apply it on the areas of concern you can absolutely apply it everywhere and i just pat it and press it into my cheeks into my nose a little bit on my chin and on my temples because i get quite a lot of redness on my temples kind of like this area you can actually see it here um so this has been really really helpful and then i allow it to sink in for a couple of minutes i usually leave a couple of minutes between every step of my routine so i'm gonna let that sink in so acelic acid is just a really great ingredient for those anti-inflammatory purposes um and killing bacteria if you're suffering from acne or if you're suffering from rosacea or if you're not sure which one you have this is a great one to introduce into your routine i'm going to leave the links to all of the products that i'm showing in the description box below otherwise we're going to move on to an eye cream because i am still using an eye cream day and evening and the one that i'm loving at the moment is the aurelia brightening eye serum so it's a thinner lighter cream for your eyes it still has a really nice consistency but a lot of the eye creams that i see i find are quite heavy and almost difficult to spread around your eyes i will just apply it on my ring finger pat it around and then in circular motions around the eye i will apply it and then pat it in so a little bit of de-puffing a little bit of massage of course sometimes i go for a tiny little pinch this is great as well to wake up those blood vessels bring a bit more oxygen new blood to the skin you can literally pinch around your whole face pinching is great while that um serum is sinking in this is what i usually do i take the time to give my face a little pinch around the brows okay and then we're going to move on to the moisturizer and the moisturizer that i am loving loving loving at the moment is the taller rain from la roche posay la shapos they actually have a whole line purely for rosacea and i haven't actually tried that line um because i've started using this and i've kind of stuck to it and i was like i'm not buying any other you know products i'm not introducing anything new into my routine at the moment and this is a really great intense moisturizing cream and even if you have combination skin like i do um i think that it will not break it out because it has been amazing for me it hasn't broken me out once which is pretty incredible considering how reactive my skin normally is so comes in a pump again and it's quite a thick moisturizer so i do about like one and a half two pumps and then again just part it everywhere if i'm going on the neck and the chest i definitely do two pumps and then a bit of massage in the neck a bit of lymph stimulation there and then we're gonna press it into the face this has a hypoallergenic formula it is great for easily irritable sensitive skin if you are prone to oily skin this is really good as well and so i'm going to leave this in the description box as well because this has been my little hero so it definitely keeps my skin soothed and moisturized at the same time and then after the um the moisturizer has sunk in i move on to my spf i am still using my tried and trusted environment spf 15. this is for winter and i find that that is enough for me um and i have been using these sunscreen for probably six years now if you have been watching my channel for a while you would have seen environ in the early stages of my channel and i still use their moisturizer i am on stage three or four at the moment so i have stepped up the amount of vitamin a that i have in the cream i still use their serums and i still love the brand very much um but the spf is definitely in my daily routine so it has a nice creamy consistency uh it doesn't give you a white cast so i just kind of do probably like the length of almost two fingers that's how much uh spf you need so i'm gonna apply it everywhere and again i just pat it in i don't really rub it into my skin i just pat it in and on my neck even though my neck doesn't really get exposed these days because i wear big jumpers with turtleneck and scarves and massive jackets because it has been so cold which doesn't help the rosacea situation for sure and then i pat the um the excess into my hands sometimes i do this if it's feeling a little bit too much like i have applied too much and that is pretty much it i also wanted to mention a supplement that i'm taking at the moment and it's the aurelia beauty and immunity support so this is probiotics with zinc and both of those for me are kind of like a must supplement that you should take if you um care for the health of your gut and if you care for the health of your skin the health of your skin is pretty much directly linked to the health of your gut and so is your immune system so if you're taking probiotics and your gut is healthy and your diet is balanced and then that will very much show up on your skin on your like whole well-being and the way that you feel and this has really been fantastic i too i take two of these a day that my friends is my morning routine and i will catch up with you in the evening for my nighttime routine um this video might be incredibly long which i apologize for but i've got a lot to say maybe i will maybe i will actually split it in two videos because um i feel like i just blab on but otherwise if you have any questions um or anything at all to let me know about please let me know in the comment section below check the description box for all the links and i will see you guys very soon in my next video or in the evening bye",

CeraVe gets\u00a0\nthe name from having three essential ceramides\u00a0\u00a0 that's the \"Cera\" so ceramides help with restoring\u00a0\nand repairing Your Skin Barrier and keeping it\u00a0\u00a0 intact it keeps all the good things in like\u00a0\nhydration keeps the bad stuff out like microbes\u00a0\u00a0 and dirt and and allergens out of the skin so it's\u00a0\na very important component of our Skin Barrier\u00a0\u00a0 -it's the glue that keeps our skin cells together\u00a0\nand then the \"Ve\" part of CeraVe is MVE technology\u00a0\u00a0 or Multivesicular Emulsion where you have

you're feeling like you are oily\u00a0\nyou feel like your skin is in need of a cleanse\u00a0\u00a0 toly cleanse your face with a CeraVe cleanser my\u00a0\npatients love CeraVe cleansers if you're feeling\u00a0\u00a0 like you're a bit dry like myself in the winter\u00a0\ntimes I will skip a morning cleansing you don't\u00a0\u00a0 have to double cleanse every day either double\u00a0\ncleansing is better for those with heavy makeup or\u00a0\u00a0 really thick layer of water resistant sunscreen\u00a0\nso in the morning you can cleanse with either\u00a0\u00a0 their hydrating cleanser their foaming cleanser\u00a0\nor their hydrating cream to foam cleanser now I\u00a0\u00a0 like to use the hydrating cream to foam cleanser\u00a0\ncuz I have combination skin and I feels a nice\u00a0\u00a0 balance there combination skin meaning I have\u00a0\noily T-Zone and dry cheeks if you are unsure of\u00a0\u00a0 your skin type wash your face wait 30 minutes\u00a0\nand see if you're oily all over then you have\u00a0\u00a0 oily skin if you are dry all over then you have\u00a0\ndry skin and if you have combination skin you're\u00a0\u00a0 like me you have that oily T-Zone and dry cheeks\u00a0\nand it can sway to being predominantly dry in the\u00a0\u00a0 winter time and being more oily in the summertime\u00a0\nso I feel like this is a nice go-to cleanser and\u00a0\u00a0 for people who wear makeup can also use this to\u00a0\nremove makeup as well so you have amino acids to\u00a0\u00a0 help with the cleansing and if you have oily skin\u00a0\nI don't have the full size but this is a sample\u00a0\u00a0 I would give my patients with oily skin this is\u00a0\nthe foaming facial cleanser by CeraVe I like to\u00a0\u00a0 say foam is really effective at picking up excess\u00a0\noil so if you have an oily skin type consider that\u00a0\u00a0 one in the morning or at night and if you have a\u00a0\ndry sensitive skin type then the CeraVe hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 facial cleanser is preferred this is is so gentle\u00a0\nthat I use this for my kids to as like a body wash\u00a0\u00a0 because they have dry skin so you can keep that in\u00a0\nthe shower as well to wash the face and your body\u00a0\u00a0 if you struggle with say eczema atopic dermatitis\u00a0\nso after cleansing we can get into the fun part\u00a0\u00a0 you can consider a vitamin C serum CeraVe makes\u00a0\nan affordable vitamin C serum this is 10% ascorbic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and ascorbic acid is a very effective form at\u00a0\nreducing dark spots in the epidermis and it's one\u00a0\u00a0 of my favorite ingredients that I added in to my\u00a0\nmorning routine in my early 30s and I just wish I\u00a0\u00a0 started maybe late 20s I do find that it does glow\u00a0\nup my skin it does help reduce dark spots and we\u00a0\u00a0 say brighten the skin by brightening the skin we\u00a0\nreduce the dark spots and when light hits her face\u00a0\u00a0 it will reflect back at the viewer and so just\u00a0\nhaving that Luminosity that increased Luminosity\u00a0\u00a0 really does help brighten the skin the CeraVe skin\u00a0\nrenewing vitamin C serum is like 20 25 bucks and\u00a0\u00a0 it's one fluid ounce which is pretty standard\u00a0\nbut very affordable but the only critique I\u00a0\u00a0 have to say with this one is that you have to use\u00a0\nit within 2 to 4 months otherwise it will oxidize\u00a0\u00a0 pretty quickly so sorry turn you guys off but you\u00a0\nsee how syrupy and kind of dark it turns that's an\u00a0\u00a0 old vitamin C serum it's not dangerous to use but\u00a0\nI'm sure the potency goes down quite a bit and it\u00a0\u00a0 becomes like this dark syrupy orange there which\u00a0\nyou don't want to put on your face um I'm just\u00a0\u00a0 going to put some of that on the back of my hand\u00a0\nthere use that up quickly because your hard-earned\u00a0\u00a0 money went towards getting a nice vitamin C serum\u00a0\nand vitamin C it's a great antioxidant that will\u00a0\u00a0 help neutralize free radical damage from the\u00a0\nSun and so I always say use this in the morning\u00a0\u00a0 because you want to have all those antioxidants in\u00a0\nyour your skin to help prevent free radical damage\u00a0\u00a0 throughout the day you're going to be outside\u00a0\nwe your vitamin C serum but it does not replace\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen you could totally use a regular lotion\u00a0\nlike say CeraVe PM lotion you can use that in the\u00a0\u00a0 morning to layer over your SRA vitamin C this one\u00a0\nhas is nice because it's niacinamide so we'll talk\u00a0\u00a0 about this more later on in the evening because\u00a0\nit's meant for PM but you can use it in the am as\u00a0\u00a0 a moisturizer it's very nice and lightweight\u00a0\nor you can just go straight to a moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 with SPF now I've talked about these two in videos\u00a0\nbefore I've compared the two the CeraVe AM and the\u00a0\u00a0 CeraVe ultralight moisturizing lotion they're\u00a0\nboth SPF 30 they both have chemical UV filters\u00a0\u00a0 they're not water resistant but very nice to put\u00a0\non as a two-in- one step we have the moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 with the sunscreen now to get the full coverage\u00a0\nof the SPF 30 you have to put a/4 teaspoon amount\u00a0\u00a0 for your entire face so put enough on okay now\u00a0\nthe texture of the am pretty thick ultra light\u00a0\u00a0 much better texture this has niacinamide though\u00a0\nso if you have rosacea or acne prone skin the nide\u00a0\u00a0 in this is very nice so you could consider this\u00a0\nbut for those who don't like the thickness and\u00a0\u00a0 want something very lightweight go with the ultra\u00a0\nlight and that will complete your skincare routine\u00a0\u00a0 for the morning very simple right very affordable\u00a0\nroutine there but if you have hyperpigmentation\u00a0\u00a0 and your skin of color say my patients who\u00a0\nare Asian or are Latino or Latina they will\u00a0\u00a0 have worsening hyperpigmentation when they're\u00a0\noutdoors and they only use a regular sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 say they just use CeraVe ultra-light or the AM\u00a0\nthey don't have that coverage for blue light or\u00a0\u00a0 the visible light spectrum from Outdoors you can\u00a0\ntake 10 steps back in your journey of treating\u00a0\u00a0 melasma or hyperpigmentation in general by going\u00a0\nout with just a regular sunscreen you need that\u00a0\u00a0 tint I'm very impressed by Cave's hydrating\u00a0\nmineral sunscreen see I use this quite a bit\u00a0\u00a0 it's quite used it's SPF 30 sheer tint and it\u00a0\nhas iron oxides in it to help with blocking\u00a0\u00a0 that visible light spectrum so putting a small\u00a0\namount on it's pretty thick it's kind of like\u00a0\u00a0 a nice way to like cover up some blemishes\u00a0\nas well but it fits my skin tone very well\u00a0\u00a0 I know some patients complain about looking a\u00a0\nlittle gray or orange with some and tint this\u00a0\u00a0 one works well but in terms of tinted sunscreen\u00a0\nit can actually be quite trial and error so this\u00a0\u00a0 is a nice one so consider the tinted version\u00a0\nif you have hyperpigmentation and your skin\u00a0\u00a0 of color Okay moving on to a night routine so at\u00a0\nnight definitely cleanse your face when I'm done\u00a0\u00a0 with Clinic I'm going to go home and wash my\u00a0\nface this is adequate if you want to use their\u00a0\u00a0 salicylic acid cleanser their CeraVe sa cleanser\u00a0\nor their acne control cleanser with 2% salicylic\u00a0\u00a0 acid those are all great you can consider those\u00a0\nand then that's salicylic acid is great it's a\u00a0\u00a0 ha a beta hydroxy acid that is oil soluble goes\u00a0\ninto your pores and cleans it out so you can do\u00a0\u00a0 that for any blackheads on the nose I wait a\u00a0\ncouple hours I'll get my notes done and then\u00a0\u00a0 when I'm ready for bed onto dry skin I'm going\u00a0\nto apply a retinol so this is the fun part too\u00a0\u00a0 retinol is great it's a vitamin a derivative\u00a0\nit helps with fine lines and wrinkles there's\u00a0\u00a0 evidence backing this up do not use if you're\u00a0\npregnant but if you're not use this long term\u00a0\u00a0 I've been using a Retinol for over 10 years and\u00a0\nit's the best decision I've made for my skin in\u00a0\u00a0 addition to sunscreen sunscreen and vitamin C in\u00a0\nthe daytime this would be for nighttime cave makes\u00a0\u00a0 two different retinols that are very popular I\u00a0\ndid a comparison video few years ago on these\u00a0\u00a0 two and I have to say that I like the resurfacing\u00a0\nRetinol Serum more than the skin renewing Retinol\u00a0\u00a0 Serum the skin renewing Retinol Serum you know\u00a0\nit's it's good it's good it has the hyaluronic\u00a0\u00a0 acid capsulate retinol but I like the licorice\u00a0\nroot extract in the resurfacing and it also has\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide so just having those brightening\u00a0\ningredients is a nice touch and I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 the texture is better on my skin with this one the\u00a0\nresurfacing so I use this one more often than this\u00a0\u00a0 one I also didn't like that CeraVe made a retinol\u00a0\nwith SPF that was purple and white I did a video\u00a0\u00a0 on it earlier I just understand why you would\u00a0\nhave sunscreen with a retinol because retinol\u00a0\u00a0 usually degrades in the Sun so I always say do\u00a0\nit at bedtime and also you got to put enough of\u00a0\u00a0 the product to get full coverage as a sunscreen\u00a0\nso you might be putting too much retinol on your\u00a0\u00a0 face because I always say when you do retinol\u00a0\nor prescription retinoids like tretinoin and\u00a0\u00a0 the stuff I prescribe you only need a pea-size\u00a0\namount for your entire face otherwise you're\u00a0\u00a0 going to run of trouble get irritation around your\u00a0\nmouth especially your cheekbones can get red and\u00a0\u00a0 irritated and you know that's just way too much\u00a0\nright so just a pea size amount whether you're\u00a0\u00a0 doing prescription or over the counter just like\u00a0\na pump get that on your fingertip break it up dots\u00a0\u00a0 on your face connect the dots and that will be all\u00a0\nyou need I know people don't believe me they say\u00a0\u00a0 that's not enough but trust me it does help um it\u00a0\nwill be enough because if you put more than that\u00a0\u00a0 you will get come to see me with a dry peeling\u00a0\nface or even red and swollen so really be careful\u00a0\u00a0 after applying this apply your moist moisturizing\u00a0\nlotion the SV PM lotion with niacinamide so great\u00a0\u00a0 to layer this with this just to end it I always\u00a0\nsay moisturize with your retinol and that's really\u00a0\u00a0 important in minimizing the irritation you might\u00a0\nget from a retinol especially the first 3 weeks\u00a0\u00a0 can be quite irritating and if you can stay with\u00a0\nyour Retinol for four plus months you will see the\u00a0\u00a0 you will see the benefits of hyperpigmentation\u00a0\nbeing improved as well as your fine lines and\u00a0\u00a0 wrinkles so it's all about staying consistent and\u00a0\nstaying with it I'm not a big fan of skin cycling\u00a0\u00a0 because you're only sprinkling it in few days\u00a0\nall the week you have to stay consistent with\u00a0\u00a0 your ingredients for it to work and that's what\u00a0\nthe studies show you have to stay on it for at\u00a0\u00a0 least every other night to Nightly for you to see\u00a0\nthe benefits of a vitamin a derivative retinoid\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's retinol or prescription retinoids\u00a0\nlike tretinoin so staying with it is important\u00a0\u00a0 I'd say this helps a lot having a moisturizer I\u00a0\njust want to show you the texture of this very\u00a0\u00a0 lightweight so just couple swipes boom disappears\u00a0\nlayers well with your acne medications plays well\u00a0\u00a0 with it I don't see people getting irritation\u00a0\nwith this lotion I'll show you the sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 texture this one the ultra lightweight showing\u00a0\nyou that look how it layers over the lotion\u00a0\u00a0 there too just disappears so very nice texture\u00a0\nSV has achieved the am could get better it's a\u00a0\u00a0 little thicker has some zinc oxides in it that's\u00a0\nwhy it's a little thicker and it takes longer to\u00a0\u00a0 rub in putting that in your face some people don't\u00a0\nlike that thickness so okay so I hope this video\u00a0\u00a0 is helpful hope you guys enjoy your cave products\u00a0\nbut again there's no perfect brand you know I've\u00a0\u00a0 always said that like there's no brand that makes\u00a0\nall their products are winners I I'd say their\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid Serum by CeraVe not a winner\u00a0\nI've never been impressed by texture on this\u00a0\u00a0 guy I mean it just comes out looking a little\u00a0\nsad there and look how it kind of pels up look\u00a0\u00a0 I can almost roll it into a ball I mean what's\u00a0\ngoing on here this is I've never seen hyaluronic\u00a0\u00a0 acid serum do that it's usually like in a dropper\u00a0\nbottle but it's almost like dried up glue Elmer's\u00a0\u00a0 Glue not feeling that texture at all their eye\u00a0\ncream not very good either looks similar to this\u00a0\u00a0 or is it eye gel or eye cream but I don't think\u00a0\nthey did a good job on I don't know why they have\u00a0\u00a0 a retinol with SPF as well so these are the the\u00a0\nones I mentioned in this video though primarily\u00a0\u00a0 those my picks that I recommend to my patients\u00a0\nand I use for myself and I hope this video is\u00a0\u00a0 helpful so please hit the like button please\u00a0\nsubscribe to the channel but also hit that Bell\u00a0\u00a0 notification for new videos every Saturday morning\u00a0\nshare

        "transcript": "hi everyone welcome back thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching this video i hope you all are\u00a0\u00a0 well and staying safe on today's video i'm\u00a0\ngonna show you the exact products that i used\u00a0\u00a0 to clear my rosacea before i started this video\u00a0\ni'd like to give you a brief history about my skin\u00a0\u00a0 i've been suffering from rosacea for the last 15\u00a0\nyears it started with slight redness on my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 chin and nose and then it got worse and later\u00a0\nit turned out to be acne rosacea i had lots of\u00a0\u00a0 flakiness on my skin like my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i had a zero skin barrier my skin\u00a0\u00a0 was very sensitive i went to see lots of doctors\u00a0\ndermatologists they only prescribed me topical\u00a0\u00a0 ointment which actually wasn't a great help for\u00a0\nme if you want to know more about my skin history\u00a0\u00a0 then please do watch my skincare journey where\u00a0\ni have talked in that there are lots of pictures\u00a0\u00a0 and video today i'm filming in natural lighting\u00a0\nthe sun is out and the reason i decided to flame\u00a0\u00a0 in natural lighting is so that you can see my real\u00a0\nskin also in skincare journey video all the skin\u00a0\u00a0 video that i posted there was flamed in natural\u00a0\nlighting when we use artificial lighting the skin\u00a0\u00a0 can look much more different than uh what it is\u00a0\nnaturally so let's start this video i'm gonna talk\u00a0\u00a0 about the four steps first is cleansing second\u00a0\nis face masking third is exfoliation and then the\u00a0\u00a0 last one is moisturizer and also i'm gonna talk\u00a0\nabout spf as a lot of you were asking about it\u00a0\u00a0 oh my god i just realized i forgot to introduce\u00a0\nmyself my name is sarita i do most like fashion\u00a0\u00a0 content story time i've started doing skincare as\u00a0\nwell lifestyle vlogs travel vlogs if you like that\u00a0\u00a0 sort of content then please feel free to subscribe\u00a0\nmy channel i would love to have you on board\u00a0\u00a0 let's start with the first step cleansings the\u00a0\ncleansing i've been using since 2004 is this\u00a0\u00a0 one i absolutely love this one this one is from\u00a0\ngarnier and it is their soothing cleansing milk\u00a0\u00a0 it's for dry and sensitive skin it is a vegan\u00a0\none i try not to use products with fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 however this has got pregnant but it doesn't break\u00a0\nme out this is the one i use to remove makeup\u00a0\u00a0 also i've stopped using face wash it was not\u00a0\ndoing much to be honest it was actually stripping\u00a0\u00a0 the oils and made it drier so i've not used one\u00a0\nfor last five six years it's been a long time and\u00a0\u00a0 whenever i didn't use makeup i would just use\u00a0\ncold water to wash my face that really helped\u00a0\u00a0 me i saw a lot of difference when i stopped using\u00a0\nface wash and sometimes if i felt like i really\u00a0\u00a0 needed to clean my face then i would actually go\u00a0\nwith this one even when i'm not wearing makeup\u00a0\u00a0 this is how it looks i've taken that much\u00a0\nand i'm gonna apply that all over my face\u00a0\u00a0 like that and i like to massage my face really\u00a0\nwell always in upward direction because the\u00a0\u00a0 gravity is already pulling our face down so that\u00a0\nis what i do and that has to prevent wrinkles\u00a0\u00a0 i really believe in a good facial massage\u00a0\nbecause it helps with blood circulation\u00a0\u00a0 also it relaxes the facial muscle i'm gonna put\u00a0\na little bit of water because when it gets dryer\u00a0\u00a0 you just need to add a little bit of water and\u00a0\nthen massage your skin again really well even the\u00a0\u00a0 eye area this takes off makeup really well this\u00a0\nis a very gentle to the skin i can smell like a\u00a0\u00a0 rose because it has got like rose water in it even\u00a0\nthough it has got that fragrance it is really good\u00a0\u00a0 to my skin i'm going to use this bamboo cotton\u00a0\npad which is reusable i used to use the normal\u00a0\u00a0 standard cotton pad and i was wasting a lot of\u00a0\nmoney on that and it's not good for environment\u00a0\u00a0 as well hence i went with this one i'll link this\u00a0\ndown below on the description box everything i use\u00a0\u00a0 today here or talk about i'll link everything on\u00a0\nthe description box so that it will be easier for\u00a0\u00a0 you guys to shop also it comes with this little\u00a0\npouch so basically when i'm done with using this\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just put that in this little pouch and then\u00a0\nit just goes in my washing machine it's very easy\u00a0\u00a0 to wash as well and it's great you know like good\u00a0\nfor sensitive skin so i'm going to put this under\u00a0\u00a0 water so that it's damp so now it's damp and i'm\u00a0\ngoing to wipe this off my face was a bare face\u00a0\u00a0 so i don't have any makeup at all so i go like\u00a0\nthis on my eyes as well on here as well my face\u00a0\u00a0 is a little bit red after that massage so pleased\u00a0\nwith the weather today it's such a lovely weather\u00a0\u00a0 like it's cold but it's still like sunny\u00a0\nthat's done you can see there's no dirt here\u00a0\u00a0 that is good now next step i'm gonna move on is\u00a0\nwith face masks this is the only face mask i used\u00a0\u00a0 when i was suffering from rosacea i stopped using\u00a0\nthe sheet marks even the korean one because it had\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of fragrance it was breaking me out really\u00a0\nbad i wanted something that would calm my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down first and i wanted something very hydrating\u00a0\nhence the reason i decided to go with yogurt so\u00a0\u00a0 this is the one i use you can use any brand\u00a0\nthis is a plain greek yogurt and i'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 take like a small spoon that spoon which will\u00a0\nbe enough for my face and neck so that much\u00a0\u00a0 yogurt has got like lactic acid and it has\u00a0\ngot zinc in it which helps to dissolve like\u00a0\u00a0 dead skin cells which is on our top layer so this\u00a0\ntop layer which you can see is called epidermis\u00a0\u00a0 and the layer underneath is called dermis when i\u00a0\nwas breaking out i had a lot of flakiness but my\u00a0\u00a0 skin was very dry and yogurt really helped me\u00a0\nwith hydration i found yogurt very soothing to\u00a0\u00a0 my skin it really calmed my skin it got rid of\u00a0\nthe flakiness yogurt is also a form of aha ah\u00a0\u00a0 is alpha hydroxy acid when i applied yogurt on\u00a0\nmy face my skin instantly loved it and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to add green tea i'm just using this one\u00a0\nhere which is a normal green tea this one is from\u00a0\u00a0 table you can use any one this is a pure green tea\u00a0\nso i take one tea bag i'm gonna use all of this\u00a0\u00a0 you can use this soaked one as well i'm gonna\u00a0\ntear that off and pop that in here with yogurt\u00a0\u00a0 so i'm gonna mix that with my spoon green tea\u00a0\nhas antioxidants it is like really good for skin\u00a0\u00a0 it reduces inflammation and my skin was honestly\u00a0\ninflamed i needed this also what i was doing at\u00a0\u00a0 the same time was i was also drinking green tea\u00a0\nevery day which really helped my skin to clear\u00a0\u00a0 when i was drinking green tea i added meatless\u00a0\nin it because when i've been traveling to morocco\u00a0\u00a0 they served us mint tea which i've never had\u00a0\nit before but while i was there i realized my\u00a0\u00a0 skin was clearing up and i knew like it was\u00a0\nto do with that tea so when i came back from\u00a0\u00a0 traveling i started drinking green tea with mint\u00a0\nin it which is like my staple drink i have that\u00a0\u00a0 every day and that really helped with my\u00a0\nmetabolism as well and to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna apply this on my skin i was applying\u00a0\nthis every day seven days a week for 30 minutes\u00a0\u00a0 if you have dry skin then i suggest don't let this\u00a0\ndry on your face however if you have oily skin or\u00a0\u00a0 combination skin you can leave it until it's dry\u00a0\ni'm using my hands to put this all over my face\u00a0\u00a0 you can go with a face brush as well however i\u00a0\nprefer to do with my hands and i'm gonna leave my\u00a0\u00a0 eye area not gonna go over there it feels so great\u00a0\ni can already feel like how amazing it feels and\u00a0\u00a0 it doesn't smell like fall i love the smell of\u00a0\nthis smell of yogurt and drink this so pleasant\u00a0\u00a0 whenever i put this on my face i love the feeling\u00a0\nespecially you know this yogurt is quite cool so\u00a0\u00a0 yeah it's like really soothing to my skin i also\u00a0\nused aloe vera at one point because a lot of\u00a0\u00a0 people were saying aloe vera is so good for skin\u00a0\nit instantly made my skin irritated it was all\u00a0\u00a0 red i'm gonna leave this for 30 minutes and come\u00a0\nback and show you in a bit hello everyone i'm back\u00a0\u00a0 so i'm gonna wash up my face you can use muslin\u00a0\ntowel to take this off however i like to wash\u00a0\u00a0 my face and that's what i'm gonna do off camera\u00a0\nand then come back again so let me show you how\u00a0\u00a0 it is looking right now this is how it is looking\u00a0\nall right i've just washed my face with water and\u00a0\u00a0 you can see my face is still wet next thing i'm\u00a0\ngonna do is pat that water into my skin like this\u00a0\u00a0 i don't use towel that we keep in the bathroom\u00a0\nthe temperature changes all the time sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 it's hot sometimes it's cold and sometimes it's\u00a0\nvery steamy the bathroom is a breeding ground for\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria hence the reason i don't use towel and\u00a0\nyou won't believe like when i'm patting this into\u00a0\u00a0 my skin it gives my skin a little bit hydration if\u00a0\nyou want to use towel go ahead but don't keep in\u00a0\u00a0 your bathroom and little things like this i'm not\u00a0\nusing towel or face wash really help my skin also\u00a0\u00a0 it is important to think about what to eat i'm\u00a0\ngonna do a separate video on what i avoid food\u00a0\u00a0 voice because that can really affect your skin\u00a0\nwhen it comes to like drinking water i have always\u00a0\u00a0 been a person who drinks a lot of water however\u00a0\nthat didn't clear my skin now i'm gonna move on to\u00a0\u00a0 exfoliation there are two ways you can exfoliate\u00a0\nyour skin physical or chemical exfoliation i used\u00a0\u00a0 to do physical one like scrubs which i had been\u00a0\nusing for years and when i had rosacea i wasn't\u00a0\u00a0 able to get rid of dead skin cells hence there was\u00a0\nlike so much flakiness on top and because of that\u00a0\u00a0 i didn't think products were penetrating deep\u00a0\ninto my dermis i used to scrub my face and you\u00a0\u00a0 guys know like scrub has got like small granules i\u00a0\nwas literally scrubbing really hard to get rid of\u00a0\u00a0 those flakiness it aggravated my skin even more\u00a0\nwhenever i am done with scrubbing my face would\u00a0\u00a0 be all red the problem with the scrub is if you\u00a0\nactually put too much pressure that can actually\u00a0\u00a0 break your skin after a realization i decided to\u00a0\nmove to chemical exfoliant and when i did research\u00a0\u00a0 i found like chemical exfoliant is really good\u00a0\nfor skin it does not just clear the top layer of\u00a0\u00a0 skin it just goes inside the dermis as well which\u00a0\nis exactly what i needed so i went with this one\u00a0\u00a0 paula's choice calm range this one is one person\u00a0\nbha bha is better hydroxy acid i used to be scared\u00a0\u00a0 of acids before because i always had this feeling\u00a0\nacid will you know ruin my skin however after a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of research i realized this is actually\u00a0\ngood for skin and it is very gentle as well\u00a0\u00a0 i have used there another one like two percent\u00a0\nbhd that doesn't agree with my skin if your skin\u00a0\u00a0 is very sensitive like mine say if you suffer\u00a0\nfrom acne rosacea then i would recommend to go\u00a0\u00a0 with this one they're calm range this is for all\u00a0\nskin types this says it minimizes pore and smooth\u00a0\u00a0 skin i didn't see much difference in my pores\u00a0\nhowever it did smooth my skin this is the one\u00a0\u00a0 that really helped with my irritation as well as\u00a0\nflakiness so i'm gonna take two pumps of that here\u00a0\u00a0 and then i'm gonna apply that all over my\u00a0\nskin this has oops got no fragrance i need\u00a0\u00a0 no essential oil and it has got green tea extract\u00a0\nwhich minimizes irritation and my skin was very\u00a0\u00a0 irritated at that time after i actually used\u00a0\nthis product you know what happened my skin\u00a0\u00a0 started to break out even more i basically had\u00a0\nthe skin purging meaning all the breakouts that\u00a0\u00a0 were supposed to happen in the future it actually\u00a0\nbrought it immediately after using this product i\u00a0\u00a0 had a really bad purging for about almost like\u00a0\nthree weeks so i'm going to go over my neck as\u00a0\u00a0 well it's very common to have skin protein you\u00a0\nhave to be patient and for the product to work\u00a0\u00a0 it can take up to a month this really helped to\u00a0\nget rid of dead skin cells i was using this about\u00a0\u00a0 five days a week however they recommend using\u00a0\nthree to four days a week nowadays i applied\u00a0\u00a0 three days a week this is the only acid i use a\u00a0\nbha i don't use aha the only form of aha i use\u00a0\u00a0 is that yogurt i've tried glycolic acid but\u00a0\nit doesn't work for me also that exfoliate i\u00a0\u00a0 talked about i've been using for the last five\u00a0\nyears and all of this product i'm still using\u00a0\u00a0 this till this day now next bit i'm going to\u00a0\nmove on to moisturizing and this is the only\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer i use and i have been using since\u00a0\nlast five six years this is from la roche posey\u00a0\u00a0 and it is called cysoplast b5 this has got\u00a0\nbomb consistency quite a thick moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 however it's not like really oily also i forgot\u00a0\nto say after using green tea and yogurt face mask\u00a0\u00a0 my skin is little bit oily because of the yogurt\u00a0\neven though i've washed my face it just leaves\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of oiliness behind which i love\u00a0\nbecause i have dry skin and it works out great\u00a0\u00a0 for me this one has got panthenol in it which\u00a0\nis also referred as a vitamin b5 antinol has\u00a0\u00a0 got like two ingredients it has got humectant\u00a0\nhumectant binds the water and hydrates the skin\u00a0\u00a0 so it stops trans epidermal water loss let me talk\u00a0\nabout trans epidermal waterless because you must\u00a0\u00a0 be thinking what the hell is this for instance\u00a0\nif you are indoors and if you are using radiators\u00a0\u00a0 that can lead you to lose water from your body\u00a0\nso that is called trans epidermal water loss\u00a0\u00a0 anyway let's apply this on my skin this is like\u00a0\na multi-purpose cream it is quite thick it's not\u00a0\u00a0 sticky at all because some of the moisturizer are\u00a0\nquite thick and very sticky this one you can use\u00a0\u00a0 on babies as well also like on insect bites\u00a0\nsunburn if you have done chemical peel and if\u00a0\u00a0 you had irritation from that you can use that as\u00a0\nwell this is such a good cream for a skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 my skin had zero barrier before i started using\u00a0\nthis one this is so great like it calmed my skin\u00a0\u00a0 as well as it really helped with flakiness so when\u00a0\ni had the skin purging with that bh i was using i\u00a0\u00a0 would apply this one to calm my skin while that\u00a0\nproduct was breaking me out this moisturizer was\u00a0\u00a0 calming my skin also another thing when you apply\u00a0\nproducts please let that product sit for a bit\u00a0\u00a0 so that it sinks into your skin which i was not\u00a0\ndoing for a while to be honest which i realized\u00a0\u00a0 much later i was applying products on top of one\u00a0\nanother really quickly the panthenol ingredient\u00a0\u00a0 also acts as emollient it smooths the skin which\u00a0\nis what it did to my skin it is non-comedogenic\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer meaning it doesn't block the pores\u00a0\nif the moisturizer is blocking the pores then you\u00a0\u00a0 might have a lot of breakout now we are moving\u00a0\non to spf which a lot of people were asking me\u00a0\u00a0 which spf i use i used this one from holla's\u00a0\nchoice brood spectrum spf 50. basically this\u00a0\u00a0 is for all skin types this is for face and body\u00a0\nand this has got antioxidants in it it has got\u00a0\u00a0 80 minutes water resistant if you are into like\u00a0\nsports you do a lot of outdoor activities this is\u00a0\u00a0 great for you what i really like about this one is\u00a0\nit has no white cast it is broad spectrum meaning\u00a0\u00a0 that it actually blocks both uv and uvb rays with\u00a0\nrosacea we are very sensitive to light so we have\u00a0\u00a0 to wear spf every day actually everybody needs to\u00a0\nwear spf every day i'm gonna put a little bit on\u00a0\u00a0 my ears as well because the sun hits over there\u00a0\nas well even if it's not a sunny day i always\u00a0\u00a0 put spf on my skin it works well with makeup i\u00a0\nreally love this this is such a great product\u00a0\u00a0 to have these are all the products i use these\u00a0\nwere the products that changed my skin it worked\u00a0\u00a0 really really well for my skin apart from\u00a0\nthese four products i didn't use anything\u00a0\u00a0 i was under no medication i was not even using\u00a0\nany topical creams it took me about three to four\u00a0\u00a0 months for my skin to get this clear so it takes a\u00a0\ntime be patient also please don't forget to watch\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare journey video where i've shown you all\u00a0\nthe pictures of recovery process as well as when i\u00a0\u00a0 had breakup there's so much information out there\u00a0\nif you like this video then please give thumbs up\u00a0\u00a0 share this video and subscribe my

        "transcript": "if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you're probably having a hard time coming with a skincare regimen or finding skincare products that are effective for you well today in this video we're going to discuss rosacea and I'm going to give you over-the-counter skincare that can help stay tuned till the end because I will make a skincare regimen for your rosacea skin type with actual product recommendations so my name is Dr Swati Canon and I'm a board certified dermatologist out here in California thank you so much for watching this video and welcome to my channel what is rosacea rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness flushing sometimes pimple like bumps on your cheeks your nose your chin as well as textural changes of the nose chin and forehead even various triggers can flare or worsen rosacea and some of these common triggers include alcohol spicy foods sun exposure even stress and I know stress can worsen really anything but stress definitely can worsen rosacea as well as certain histamine-rich foods like tomatoes avocados certain skincare products can also rest in rosacea so there are a lot of triggers for rosacea and a lot of people don't really know what their triggers are so I recommend sometimes keeping a diary so you can know like hey I had red wine and now I have redness and flushing and all the rosacea symptoms or I had an avocado toast yesterday and now my rosacea is worse so keeping a diary can help with noticing what your triggers are but you know it is annoying to keep a diary so I get it rosacea can also affect really any ethnicity and any gender but it is more common in middle-aged Caucasian men and women unfortunately rosacea is chronic like a lot of our inflammatory conditions and there is no cure there are different types of rosacea so we have categorized them into different subsets the first type is called erythamato telangiotatic rosacea I know I don't know why dermatologists have such long words but this type of rosacea is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels or dilated blood vessels on the skin the second type is called Popular are popular postular rosacea and this is when you get pimple like bumps kind of in the middle of your face often acne and popular puscular rosacea can go together so they can be seen together the third type is called fiberous rosacea and this is when you get a thickening of skin or like a bulbous appearance on your nose and finally there's also ocular rosacea this is rosacea affecting the eyes causing redness tearing itching and sometimes vision problems now these categories are actually kind of fluid and changing there is an overlap between all of these categories so you can have you know erythematode rosacea and popular puscular rosacea so there's a lot of overlap but it just kind of helps to Define and gives us guidelines for treatment this video is going to focus on redness and the pimple form of rosacea and how to calm down the Baseline inflammation in rosacea patients thymus and ocular rosacea there is not really any over-the-counter treatment that helps for that so those require prescription or in-office treatments what are the best in ingredients for rosacea the main thing for rosacea patients is to use anti-inflammatory and hydrating ingredients goal is to have a simple yet effective skin care regimen that decreases the inflammation and doesn't cause irritation so you don't want to overuse skin care products the first ingredient for rosacea that I really love is azolic acid we've talked about azelaic acid a lot on my channel and even in my previous video that gave you ingredients for discoloration as a lake acid is one of them so it is one of the best ingredients for acne for rosacea for skin lightening it is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial meaning that it decreases some of the bacteria that play a role in rosacea over the counter you can find 10 azelic acid and we also give prescription strength which is 15 or 20 percent acetylic acid it's best to use acelic acid at night time most rosacea patients are not going to be able to tolerate a retinoid so you're going to use azelic acid instead the next ingredient for rosacea patients is niacinamide and this is a form of vitamin B3 and again I have talked about it a lot nice and mind is in a lot of skincare products especially in moisturizers it's helpful for redness it is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for hydration it also regulates oil production it reduces the appearance of pores so it's really an overall great ingredient for rosacea patients who also have probably all these other issues I don't recommend using niacinamide above five percent I recommend staying under five percent so notorium has a five percent niacinamide gel that you can try also a lot of moisturizers sunscreens they do have niacinamide so you don't have to use niacinamide separately I actually recommend using niacinamide in a moisturizer or in a sunscreen versus by itself tranexamic acid is the other ingredient for rosacea I definitely have it in my previous video where I talk about how helpful it is for hyperpigmentation and melasma it is also so helpful for rosacea because we now know that txa regulates blood vessel formation excessive blood vessel formation and dilation of blood vessels is what causes the redness and the flushing in rosacea patients and so when we can regulate it we can really minimize the appearance of redness txa is also very gentle so it is very well tolerated by most rosacea patients the one that I like is the notorium tranexamic acid serum this contains five percent tranexamic acid and niacinamide plus kojic acid it's helpful for lightning and for rosacea the next ingredient for rosacea is sodium sulfacedamide plus sulfur so sodium sulfacetamide is an anti-inflammatory skincare ingredient but this is often a prescription and it's really hard to find it over the counter however you can find sulfur soaps over the counter and sulfur is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial and that's kind of how it helps rosacea it is incredibly stinky sulfur smells like rotten eggs so some people just can't tolerate the smell of it but sulfur also helps with acne it helps with dandruff called cyborg dermatitis there's a lot of uses for this ingredient so just to clear up any confusion the first ingredient I talked about was sodium sulfacetamide and this can come as a face wash but it's hard to find it over the counter it's usually a prescription we combine sodium sulfacinamide with sulfur and that combination is very good for rosacea but you can also just find sulfur alone as a soap and this is what's usually found over the counter and sulfur alone has some of these properties that I just talked about the next ingredient for rosacea is using ceramides so ceramides are emollients that I've spoken about in the moisturizer video before and ceramides repair the Skin Barrier and they help to hydrate the skin so for rosacea patients it's incredibly important to maintain your skin barrier to protect that Skin Barrier so that you don't get too much irritation I like products like Ulta MD or CeraVe that make moisturizers and sunscreen with ceramides and niacinamide glycerin is another really great humectant for rosacea patients because glycerin is such a powerful hydrating ingredient so it really draws in that water to help moisturize your skin the next ingredient for rosacea is called acetyl tetrapeptide 40. so remember in my peptide video and I don't know if you guys watched it if you haven't watched watch my peptide video please go check it out but in my peptide video I talked about certain peptides that are anti-inflammatory an acetyl Tetra peptide 40 is an anti-inflammatory peptide that can be very helpful for rosacea it helps to reduce inflammation as well as redness it also helps to maintain the Skin Barrier and to protect the Skin Barrier function there are also other peptides that can be anti-inflammatory in fact Paula's Choice peptide booster has multiple peptides several of which are anti-inflammatory and can be very helpful for redness and rosacea patients by the way if you're enjoying and learning from this video please hit the Thumbs Up Button And subscribe to my channel and please also share this video with others who would find it helpful I am trying to grow my channel in 2023 so I am very grateful to all of you who are watching commenting and interacting with my content another really great rosacea ingredient is called and I'm gonna butcher this Camila Camila sinensis anyway this is green tea leaf extract so green tea leaf extract is really helpful for rosacea green tea as we know is very anti-inflammatory it's a very powerful antioxidant and it is used in skincare sometimes especially for rosacea skin another ingredient that I'm going to butcher is called Santa Nella asiatica definitely can't pronounce that but we're going to continue so Santa Nella asiatica in India we actually have this ingredient as well but we call it go to kala and it has many many benefits I actually remember taking gotu kala when I was little for colds it is a powerful antioxidant it is anti-inflammatory and it also helps a lot for inflammation with rosacea patients so it has become a lot more popular in America and it's become a lot more popular in skincare recently in the last few years so beauty of joseon is a Korean skincare brand that actually has a serum that contains a green tea leaf extract Centinela asiatica and vitamin B5 so it's very calming it's hydrating and it's also fragrance free so for rosacea patients that's like a winner have you guys tried Korean skincare products and Korean sunscreens if so please let me know and comment below I really love how Koreans approach skincare with their hydrating and calming ingredients so I think I'm definitely gonna make a YouTube video about it soon but let me know what Korean skincare products you have tried so that I can also look into them Dr jart psychopair tiger grass serum tiger grass or pear serum this has Centinela asiatica and niacinamide it also has like a greenish tint so you can use it in the morning because the green tip helps to cover redness and then it's anti-inflammatory for the actual rosacea component Dr jart sick a pear stick a player is it sick of pear or a single player crap sometimes like I cannot remember these names but this particular line of product also has a moisturizer with similar ingredients that is very common for rosacea patients so you can either use it in a serum or as a moisturizer burrito Centinela green level safe SPF 50 p8 plus plus this isn't a really great sunscreen by the way for rosacea and acne important patients because it contains Centinela asiatica niacinamide vitamin E is an SPF 50. so I really do like this sunscreen fertilization patients and if you've tried it let me know the other sunscreens I normally like for rosacea patients I tend to like sunscreens with zinc oxide so which is a physical sunscreen and I like physical sunscreens over chemical sunscreens because sometimes chemical sunscreens can worsen or trigger rosacea but there are certain chemical sunscreen formulations that are okay that are more well tolerated and one of them is the Ulta MD UV clear and I recommend this for a lot of different patients but it's a really great sunscreen with SPF 46 it contains niacinamide and it's very well tolerated a La Roche Posay also makes various sunscreens for rosacea patients and these are also pretty well tolerated so not all chemical sunscreens are going to flare your rosacea in general I do prefer physical sunscreens but some chemical formulations are okay by the way let's clear up differences between sensitive skin rosacea and having allergies or rashes to certain skin care products so some sensitive skin that's a broad category of patients that just means that you can't tolerate skin care more readily this includes your rosacea patients but you can also have sensitive skin without having rosacea sensitive skin means you're more likely to get rashes or irritation or acne more easily so it's really a broad category that includes various skin types rosacea is what I just said earlier where you have dilated blood vessels and can be characterized by flushing or pimple like bumps this is different than people who get an allergic or contact dermatitis or a rash from exposure to certain ingredients and skin care products or to even certain metals or to other types of preservatives so the most common example of contact dermatitis is nickel dermatitis and dermatitis by the way just means inflammation of the skin so that's a very non-specific term but nickel dermatitis you might have seen this is when patients or when people get a rash around their belly button because of coming into contact with the nickel and the button and the pants or the jeans so if you you tend to get contact dermatitis a common way to test for this at home is you can apply skincare product on your forearm for one to six weeks and see if you get any rashes or irritation if not you can then try the product on your face now this by the way this test the forearm test doesn't work for rosacea patients so rosacea patients it's very hard to see for skincare products can help you or harm you until you try but for rosacea patients what you can do is just try on the side of your face and see if you if you get a flare what are my ingredients to avoid in rosacea skin salicylic acid is one ingredient to avoid even if you have acne and rosacea so I know we commonly use salicylic acid for acne it is anti-inflammatory but it is also so irritating that we don't really recommend it for rosacea patients and this is a similar concept for benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide also is anti-inflammatory we also use it for acne but I don't always recommend it for rosacea patients because they can be irritating perhaps in low percentages it would be okay we just have other ingredients that we can use so we don't have to use these and this is the same for glycolic acid which is a type of chemical exfoliating acid because it's irritating or it can be irritating I also don't recommend it for rosacea now on the flip side polyhydroxy acids which are like a newer type of exfoliating acid they can be helpful for rosacea because they are less irritating they are more gentle and they can be anti-inflammatory so some rosacea patients can try polyhydroxy acids by the way not everyone needs to exfoliate so your skin naturally exfoliates on its own you don't have to use a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid or polyhydroxy acid to help exfoliate so don't feel the need to do so other ingredients like witch hazel Menthol camphor those all cause tingling that doesn't mean by the way it's working but they're all kind of these tingling irritating ingredients and I don't recommend them for rosacea other astringents or toners that contain alcohol or heavy content of alcohol definitely avoid this if you have rosacea because it can be so drying on the other hand though rose water toner can be helpful because rose water is coming and I actually made this video it talks about at home remedies for skin hair and nails if you're interested you can definitely go check it out fragrance if you see that on the label that could potentially also be irritating for rosacea so I would be mindful about it but by the way when you're looking at fragrance and alcohol you know you have to also see where it is on the ingredient list so if alcohol is like the sixth or seventh ingredient in the ingredient list it's probably gonna be okay and it's not going to dehydrate your skin that much but if it's in the top three ingredients then that means that that skin care product has too much alcohol and could potentially dehydrate your skin so retinoids I mean they are really an anti-aging Powerhouse but they can definitely trigger and flare rosacea so you do have to be careful I don't think retinoids are completely off limits for rosacea patients it really depends on how severe your rosacea is and what your triggers for rosacea are you know you just want to be careful so if you're going to want to use retinoids and you have rosacea you want to start very gentle gentle retinoids and then slowly increase their use as tolerated so to learn how to incorporate retinoids you can actually watch one of my first YouTube videos ever on retinoids and it really kind of teaches you how to incorporate a retinoid slowly into your skincare regimen some good options for retinoids in rosacea patients include this Keels Retinol Serum it's ceramides and peptides so this one contains retinol which is a gentler former for retinoid also and it contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides and peptides so start this one slowly but it is a good option for rosacea patients of course if you see an irritation or you see flaring of your rosacea stop any of these skincare products immediately the other good one for rosacea patients is the ordinary Grand active retinol Emulsion brand active retinol is a much gentler type of retinoid so it's really great for rosacea and sensitive skin types and this one also contains squalene invisible law which are ingredients that help with inflammation and hydration and it doesn't contain the shark squalene but the vegan version of squalene now how would you combine all of these ingredients for a skincare regimen in the morning you can use a gentle cleanser so you can actually use the sulfur wash or a prescription sodium sulfacetamide wash like I talked about earlier or you can just use a gentle cleanser like the La Roche Posay tolerain hydrating gentle cleanser or CeraVe gentle cleanser after you clean your face you can use one of the green tea serums like the beauty of joseon green tea serum or the Dr jarts like a pear serum followed by a moisturizer and then sunscreen on top so your moisturizer recommendations include like the Dr jarts like a pear moisturizer or a banana cream moisturizer or a CeraVe moisturizer really anything that's gentle and contains ceramides is a good moisturizer for rosacea patients and you would then follow this up by a sunscreen like the Alta MD UV clear sunscreen which also contains ceramides and niacinamide at night time you can again clean your your face and make sure you use a gentle cleanser to wash off even the makeup of your face you can then use a gentle retinoid like the Kiehl's Retinol Serum or you can use acelaic acid at night time so if you're going to use salicylic acid you can actually use it every single night as long as you don't get irritation but if you want to start a retinoid then you can use a retinoid twice a week and use azelic acid on the other night you would then follow this up with a moisturizer as well and some good moisturizer for rosacea patients include Ulta mdpm therapy or that Dr jart sickle player moisturizer that I talked about earlier on a side note if you do wear makeup and heavily tinted sunscreens and you have rosacea I still recommend that you double cleanse so you can watch this video on double cleansing to learn how to do it well for rosacea patients I don't want you to use any cleansers that strip the moisture off your face so to remove the makeup I recommend the cleansing bombs like the pharmacy Green Clean cleansing balm which is very hydrating and then you would follow the cleansing balm with a gentle cleanser an alternate skin care regimen would be this so in the morning you would cleanse like I talked about above you can then use a vitamin C serum and we'll talk about that soon followed by a moisturizer and then Alta you know the Alta MD sunscreen at night time again you can double cleanse use your azelaic acid and then a niacinamide moisturizer so as you notice I did mention vitamin C even if you have rosacea and vitamin C can really help with rosacea because it is anti-inflammatory and so it can help with some of the flares that rosacea patients have however certain forms of vitamin C and high concentrations of vitamin C can also flare rosacea so if you want to learn how to use vitamin C and you have rosacea make sure to check out this video that I have on vitamin C where I give vitamin C recommendations for rosacea patients and you can learn how to use it in your skincare regimen so thank you so much for

        "transcript": "[Music] hey guys it's Heidi welcome back to the Inside Out Beauty and in today's episode I wanted to share with you my skincare routine but we're not going to discuss any skincare products these are very specific to managing redness and the reason behind this is that I have the most ridiculously sensitive skin you will ever know so if you guys have um you know tendency to have retinas if you guys have rosacea or very very allergic skin then you will probably find my personal experience helpful um that said these dazen at all replace the professional guidance of a dermatologist so you guys if you have chronic redness and you're not sure the source uh then please do go ahead and visit your doctor because I'm clearly not one all right so let me just share with you the products and the brands that I'm currently using um and tell you kind of in what situations each of them is more helpful for [Music] me all right so in the morning the first thing I want to do is of course clean my skin but I don't need to clean it very very thoroughly because one I don't have oily skin my skin is rather dry or very very dry actually and of course I would have already cleaned it more thoroughly the night before when I removed my makeup I can use a very very gentle cleanser and for that I use the Evan sakom ad oilbased says here it's specific to calming ity skin also specific to very very dry skin to allergies as well so yeah it just says my name all over it's really really really really soft has a nice pump so it's really easy to apply theen line is famous for having thermal water and is also made in French if you have slightly more oily or combination skin then I would recommend the aan tree SRA it's a cleansing gel without soap and without perfume and it's also for very dry skin but I do find that it is more for a deeper cleansing and it can be just a tiny bit harsher to me this kind of irritates my skin a a little bit and I know it sounds ridiculous because this is you know specific for sensitive skin but I prefer this one because it's more for a very very dry skin like mine and it's more gentle and the tercera I think would be better for people who usually need more uh more thorough deeper cleansing if that makes sense The Next Step will most of the times depend on what I'm doing next like like if it is a weekend and I'm not going out straight away maybe I'm just you know chilling at home uh then I will go one way and then a weekday and I have to run errands where we go out to the sun then I will go another way so let's start with a typical weekday in which of course you have to get out of your house and expose your very sensitive skin to the Sun and really for just about any skin type you always want to be super protected and for that I use the aen anti- rouers uh moisturizing protective cream uh for jure that's for the day and it has of course SPF 20 um which of course will protect you from sunlight and stuff like that now I have to say every single product I've tried every single moisturizer I've tried for my face with SPF has in some way or another caused just a Teena bit of irritation I wouldn't use it if it did cause brightness like dramatic brightness for me but it's not I don't find it particularly soothing this product but you always always need to wear sunscreen because of your sensitivity as well so it's kind of a trade-off um I'm going to tell you in just one second what I do um to kind of overcome the fact that sunscreen in any form for me is really really irritating uh but I want to kind of rra up about this product like I said it's a moisturizing protecting cream with SPF 20 to for dry to very dry sensitive skin that's Pro prone to CER roses it basically hydrates and protects from the Sun and what I do is mix this with another product from the same line from the aan anti- rur line and this is the anti- rouers Fort this is a relief concentrate for chronic redness and basically what I do is I apply the day cream moisturizer with SPF first all over my face and then on this area on my cheeks that's the most and my nose that is the the area my sensitive area actually because I don't get retinas anywhere else uh I would apply anti- rouers for it and this you guys this is my top this is at the top of my list on things to repurchase I will for sure for sure always have this product at least until it stops working for me because I honestly put a little bit of this product on my cheeks and it it in a few seconds it will just calm it down just really really Soothe My Skin and and both of these are fine if you use them you know to prime your face just before foundation anytime in the day you have a flare or even if you don't have time to wear foundation and you see your red face and you go like I really don't want to go out looking like this then I always turn to this um anti-er Port that's really concentrate I put it on just I don't know a couple minutes before leaving and I will feel a lot more confident as my skin soups if it's my pamper evening or if I have got in a bit more time because I'm kind of prepping for an event or a dinner party or you know just because it's the weekend and I'm just chilling and I don't really have to be anywhere then I will use the Evan anti- rouers cm it's a retinus relief soothing Repair Mask has a different type of texture you basically put it on and leave it for 5 minutes and then when you you see that your your skin looks more like soothed and your your redness is gone then you just wash it off another thing that I find really helpful and this is actually this product is actually the reason I looked into event products in the first place and this brings me back to the beginning of the video remember my little advice over there to go to your dermatologist okay so this is what happened I started having a lot of redness more than normal and I went to my dermatologist and she said amongst other things like being allergic or you know having dermatitis and I don't know what else she said you have also a little bit of rosacea when you get those little like pimples um that are not acne they're just if you guys have ration you know what I'm talking about they're really really small ones and they they itch a little bit so when I went there she said of course those little pimples they kind of damage your skin you know a little bit because uh you know you're because of course they will eventually like break and you know it it it's just not good for your skin so what she prescribed me like literally because of then you guys should know it's not a Cosmetics company it's a pharmaceutical company so she actually prescribed uh Cal fate I hope I'm saying this correctly French products um so uh this is a repair cream for very sensitive and irritated skins and this is great now this cannot be worn in my experience it it's not good under your foundation but if you are like in the evening or if you're just chilling and or before going to bed at night and you really want to kind of help your skin heel these two the rers anti- rouers for and the CLE face are for sure for sure two that I will always repurchase even the water contains chlorine and other chemicals to kind of purify it at least in my country it does and that can be a little bit irritating for someone that's very sensitive like me so I did purchase the uh alal or the thermal water from a v as well has 300 mL of thermal water now I have I have to say I haven't found this particularly soothing um it's not like I put it on and I see a dramatic difference like I do see with these other two products I mentioned but um I do prefer because it doesn't irritate my skin as much as t water so uh I use it and also there's a few other things I use the thermal water for use for my beauty blender to get it slightly wet even to set my makeup I also uh use this sometimes so yeah I mean I like it I'm not 100% sure if I'm in a tight budget I will probably skip it Al together the next thing I want to show you and this is kind of can be kind of homemade this is a herbal lotion even better than the event thermal water I have to say I'm sorry but um in that in this particular product I think this one wings and you can you know prepare it at home you don't have to spend that much money at all this is a combination of camomile Ando oh my God I don't know how to say that in English let me search translate tilo to English huh lynon there thank you Google translate so this is a combination of Kile te and lynon you basically put this in your freezer and when you have a flare then I would just go ahead and just spray it all over and it's just a this very cooling super calming uh sensation the other thing I really really really really want to recommend is the beauty blender pure and this is the white Beauty blender I would recommend it for anyone but particularly anyone that has sensitive skin or uh tendency to ress you really don't want to Rob your skin while applying skin care this has a right bals it will also add a little water so that your skin care kind of um absorbs better so yeah it's definitely a great idea to have one of these you guys and also it's white so it's not going to get stained with your skincare it's also a color guide for you so that you don't get it mixed up with your other Beauty blenders I mean this is a great idea now back to daytime if I want to go out and I will not wear makeup whatsoever and I'm looking really really really red and I don't want it for some reason I I don't want to use you know the other event products the SPF one there is a really really good line that I've been using for a very long time from Clinique and that's the Clinique redness Solutions and this one is a daily protective base with SPF 15 and this one is really good I wish the SPF was a little bit higher like or 30 but what this has that the moisturizing protective cream from the event antier like doesn't have is a a very agreeing pigmentation kind of in the gray area between makeup and skincare but I would say is more of a skincare product so what I would do is a PL in my problem area it's green but it starts becoming like it starts blending in you're not going to look green it will give me more confidence to go out without makeup Solutions line is really really good but I find that it is particularly better when I'm having rosacea flares as opposed to just sensitive sensitivity or allergies which is a different type of you know um redness like I mentioned before now these are two other products that have SPF and they're kind of all on that same area between being a makeup product or being a skincare product and these are the first of the clinque uh City Block Shear uh this is kind of a tinted moisturizer with SPF so this looks a little bit more like Foundation um but it's not irritating and it has SPF 25 as opposed to these one that I just showed you that only has SPF 20 so that's why I keep it when I want a little bit more more coverage but I still want to kind of protect from the Sun maybe I'm going sailing or I'm going to a barbecue or to the pool and I don't want to look to like having too much makeup and I want to have uh you know good SPF protection and I will for sure reach out to the city blog in fact if you've seen my backups case video you've probably seen that I keep an extra one of these because that really really good and it comes really handy um the other one the L'Oreal nude Magi CC cream um this one is again very specific for uh redness and neutralizes redness and it also has SPF 20 so it would be a more affordable option to this one to the Clinique daily protected base uh broad spectrum with SPF 15 but it has SPF 20 and you can buy on the drugstore and it's more affordable than the cleaning one last thing I want to show you in that kind of gray area is the redness solution targeted corrector and this is actually a concealer um but it's also from the red solution line a yellow concealer so you would apply over your retinas here in this triangle and just Shear it out with a beauty blender and you would be um neutralizing that redness over there the only thing I have to say about this product is that it hasn't got enough yellow pigmentation and not as much as I would need to really concel my redness if your redness is not as bad as mine then this will be a good alternative but for me it's kind of too light so moving on let's start with my nighttime routine and of course at night I usually have makeup that I have to remove that I've used all day and when you have have sensitive skin that's prone to redness again you don't want to Rob your skin you need to find something that will literally melt all your makeup uh this may count as a surprise to you guys but the best thing ever I can recommend is the Johnson's baby oil with Alo Vera and Vitamin E this is really like uh harmless and it will require while minimum rubbing I wholeheartedly recommend this it is inexpensive if it's good for the baby's tushi it's good for your very sensitive skin the other option that I'm honestly almost out of but um it may be a good option if you're not if you have oily skin and you're not very you know you don't really like um using baby oil for your face for some reason this is amazing for me again this is my favorite I prefer a million times the Johnson's baby oil than the Clinique take the day off cleansing milk but if you guys want something more like highend and you guys like the Clinique line this is a very gentle um cleansing milk as well it's kind of not related strictly to retinas but I will show you anyway my eyes I use the Clinique All About Eyes reach cream pink smell one and it's depuffing it's really good good uh for my skin and it doesn't get my uh eye area red at all so I can you know rely on this cream um and the next thing I will do is depending on where I'm at like if I'm more allergic or if I'm not if I'm having kind of a rosacea flare again you can identify the difference because ration fles have have those little pimples and in that case I will use the retina solution again this one is the daily relief cream um I use it at night because it doesn't have SPF and because it's not it's kind of gel like I don't know how to describe it but it kind of creates a little film like a little layer and it's not good to apply makeup over I wouldn't use this to moisturize and then apply makeup because I've done that and and just my Foundation doesn't look good and it has a green pig [Music] uh that doesn't show at all when you apply it it's really really subtle and it contains amongst other things it contains green tea RG tested it's 100% fragrance free and dermatologist certified in reductions for retinas it's extra gentle oil oil free moisturizing cream that's appropriate for skins with rosacea like I said so if I'm feeling more like I have a rosacea flare I will turn to this at night um now that said right now for instance I'm not having any Ry Chef Wares so it doesn't make sense at all it won't help me at all if the redness is not connected with Rosa like right now it's connected to allergies and just spring allergies for that I only recently found like seriously the most the most gentle cream ever so happy if you have sensitive skin and you know what it feels to kind of not have it respond the way you want and be concerned about your retinas you will understand why I feel this way these will be also in my top repurchases for sure the aan sakom ad balm it's a lipid replenishing balm so it is oil based it kind of gives your uh your dryy skin the pits it needs and that sometimes is a cause for itchy skin and very very dry skin that it's missing the oils that naturally needs and for some reason you're not producing the genetic reasons or you know maybe aging or whatever reason it is and it's really important to know that it is recommended for babies as well again if it's good for your baby it's good for your sensitive skin and it for uh severe dryness it has 0 % preservatives 0% parabens 0% fragrance and 0% alcohol for me it's like it's a miracle I feel like I've nailed it with this product um and with the other one I'm just about to show you right now but honestly you guys if you are in the search and you have nail it by all means get a SLE or just you know get get a hold of it somehow get a friend to to show you or get someone at the dstore to to give you to kind of try it on you in the same line is the Evan tolerance extreme h u moisturizer it's a hydrating and soothing cream and it's for hyper hyper sensitive skins and uh allergic skin so again it's my type of skin the only thing I have to say that's not so good about this product is that it it has a very special um applicator inside it's supposed to avoid contamination of the product and you have to really press to get product out but when you do it's like a ton of product comes out and you don't really need that much product the balm the big one has the exact same applicator in the in the bottle and I don't have the same problem so that's it for my 2015 sensitive skincare routine I hope you guys enjoyed I will leave all the links in the description box and the full list of all the products I just mentioned just expand also in there you can find all the links to my social media feel free to follow me there and please a thumbs up if you like this video let me know if you have any other requests and I will talk to you all again on my next video
