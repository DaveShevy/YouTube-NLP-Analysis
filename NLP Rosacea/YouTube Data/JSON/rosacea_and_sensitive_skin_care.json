        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds I'm Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to Pillow Talk durm where we meet every Saturday morning to expand your brain and mind in the process if you have no idea who I am subscribe so you know what's good for you but I am a board certified dermatologist and today we are going to be focusing on rosacea because it is the last weekend of rosacea awareness month and I've taken pity on you flushed red human beings out there so we're going to focus on how to better identify your rosacea and help yourself but before I do that make sure you head on over to d r ris.com because I am starting a new newsletter that's going out every week that is purely educational focused from Dr eris.com so we'll be recapping some of the YouTubes we'll be focusing on new topics if you guys have questions make sure to email us at hello.com and we will make sure to incorporate those questions into that newsletter every week so head on over there I will link it below on the screen so back to rosacea what is it what causes it how do you identify it we're going to get in right now rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition it is not acne and I have to start off by saying this because as a Derm I get so annoyed when I see the marketing around ingredients for rosacea as acne but I understand why they do this and I'm going to let you guys in on something take for example sulfur which we're going to talk about in this video in order to get a drug fact label on a sulfur product so you can have a quote unquote medical indication for that ingredient you have to abide by what the FDA sees that ingredient fit for sulfur has traditionally been approved by the FDA for acne so they often write for example on sulfur purpose acne treatment and that's huge for a brand that they can actually say that so they're going to go ahead and run with it but sulfur is traditionally great for rosacea and not necessarily acne so I think in the process the public has gotten confused and started confusing the two and treating rosacea like acne but that is probably the worst thing you can do because it can disrupt your Skin Barrier more and it can inflame your rosacea worse in the process but I wanted you guys to understand this very nuanced thing so that you know as a person that rosacea is truly not acne it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is due to a multitude of different things we actually don't know exactly why you get it we do believe there is a genetic predisposition when you think of Rosa you think of a white person who gets really red but do not assume that darker skin tones can't have rosacea either it is just harder to detect and see but they can absolutely have rosacea too and it's usually due to a multitude of different factors from genetics chronic heat UV exposure a broken Skin Barrier little tiny mites like these called Demodex mites that are just going rampid on your skin we all have them some of us have them a little bit more than others and when they wake up and they're alive they tend to just mess up but deodex mites an overabundance of reactivity in terms of flushing etc etc etc and when you have a little bit of everything The Perfect Storm can show up on your face when you're nervous when you're stressed when you're hot when you're eating spicy foods when you're on a date you name it but there are really if you want to take a step back four main types of rosacea starting with the most common emodal ectatic rosacea Arial means red tantic means blood vessels rosesa is rosesa so when you have somebody who's red with a lot of broken blood vessels all over their face they have one of the most common forms known as the athematic type then you have the one that I think people get confused by that they confuse with adult acne papulo pular rosacea papules and P little red bumps and little tiny bumps all over your face usually along the cheeks the nose maybe a little bit here can sometimes happen along the chin interesting tip and this one's a good one you do not have blackheads in rosacea and with rosacea the nasal labial folds this area is spared so if you're having all of a sudden a breakout right here around your mouth it's probably not rosacea if it affects your nasal laal folds then you have the the third type which is like your old white uncle that you just can't or maybe you love or you just don't really like I don't know maybe I'm projecting but you have Fus rosacea where when you have chronic inflammation right and enlarged sweat glands the skin can appear thicker and your pores can look enlarged and your nose starts to get really distended and honestly deformed over time it can happen to your nose it can happen to your chin it can happen to your forehead that's the Fus type then the fourth type is ocular rosacea which people often Overlook completely but the eyes are usually affected in 50% of rosacea sufferers and what do you get with that you get blefaritis so inflammation along the eyelid margins you can get redness of the white part of your eye you have to take an eye hygiene into consideration but also when your eyes are affected and they're chronically inflamed especially the lid margins you want to calm that inflammation down so you don't f up your eyeballs in the process and have scratches on your corneil so that's usually an oral medication and that's why you shouldn't be scared of going on systemic medications but you should probably also see an opthalmologist and let them know about it so how can you then help yourself first without going into any sort of over-the-counter products or even prescription medications or in office treatments there's lifestyle and the things associated with lifestyle you're not going to like but this is the hard truth hot showers no steam no all of you weirdos love Hot Yoga that Take 5 hours to go in and out to actually do I tried doing it one year and I died no we don't do hot yoga spicy food I mean everything in moderation okay every once in a while it's fine but if you're going to eat like chili peppers with every meal you're going to mess up your Rosa alcohol caffeine chocolate a lot of chocolate can affect stress yes we need to start meditating in the morning certain medications the list goes on and on and on so you really do have to start listening to your skin and understanding how you're reacting to certain triggers whether it is sitting out in the sun or going into a hot yoga room or doing a steam or a sauna etc etc cooking maybe it's a perfect excuse for you not to cook and so you guys get the gist right make it work to your benefit so what are then the top ingredients that we can incorporate into our routine if we have rosacea and we're trying to help ourselves and I'm going to look for things that are calming and soothing that are going to help restore our Skin Barrier that are going to reduce inflam and that are basically Beyond The Gentle basic skin care that we think of when we think of basic sensitive skin like Cal oatmeal panol Etc glycerin we want to look for ingredients that are going to actively help reduce the look of that is the correct way of saying it if you are in the industry because you can't claim that it's reducing inflammation it's helping reduce the look of inflammation and redness number one and this is probably the most popular one on the market that I think a lot of Ros of people know about and look for directly Santella atica Santella atica is known for redness reducing properties anti-inflammatory properties it has atico sdes medas aides and aziatic acid in it which all have anti-inflammatory effects and it reduces the look of inflammation it has been shown also just side note to promote collagen production so and it also has certain antioxidants that can protect the skin from the damage caused by free radicals obviously full disclosure my brand the depuffer why do I love this product if you have rosacea because it is loaded in centella asiatica but it also has arnica and arnica is not one that is traditionally thought of for rosacea but it works like a charm because it helps reduce the redness and calms the inflammation in a synergistic way that your skin looks def flushed within a couple of minutes when done correctly at the right concentration arnica is tricky though because when you guys look for arnica products more often than not they're diluted in a homeopathic fashion this one is purely Brown because it is pure arnica the color that you guys see here this golden hue is due to the high concentration of arnica in this formulation then you have one that a lot of people with rosacea know about Dr jart Dr jart has his tiger grass which is another name for cantella asiatica color correcting treatment it's a mineral sunscreen with zinc and titanium and it has a green tint to it and a more opaque fashion versus this that is going to help neutralize the look of redness because when you're red you want green to block the red we're not going to go into the art of it take an art course that's not my jam although I do like painting number two we have sulfur I hinted at sulfur at the beginning of this video sulfur is going to be marketed as an acne treatment I.E like on this when you see eradicate daily foaming cleanser acne treatment because it has 3% sulfur but it's not really just an acne treatment it's a rosacea treatment why because sulfur helps to minimize inflammation it regulates seen production a lot of people with rosacea have a lot of overproduced seim think of the nose think of the chin and it also helps to minimize inflammation as well it has antimicrobial properties which is helpful right but not the main reason of why it works and it has mild exfoliating properties but it's not going to over strip you and Break Your Skin Barrier worse making your rosacea flare up in the process there's another product by pieter Thomas Roth they have a 10% sulfur clay mask which is much more potent than the cleanser form and then you have one available at your local drugstore called Dela Cruz where you can literally spend a couple of bucks smell like a rotten egg and improve your skin in the process so those are the sulfur products that are high up at number two when it comes to ingredients number three is AAL acid AAL acid is an ingredient that I have a honestly more of a love love relationship with a little bit of a hate because it's not elegant it pills and it messes up a formula when you mix it with other actives at the right% and in order to use aoic acid if you have rosacea you really want to be at 10% or above but above that is prescription and prescription is 15% which is sweet spot and I don't know how the prescription is formulated but it's so elegant finaa is so elegant and I do not get paid by that drug company whatsoever um but it's a 15% prescription on to over the- counter though we have paa choice this is a 10% AIC acid booster I believe um it has a little bit of licorice it does have salicylic acid I don't know the percent of Sal acid in this if you're sensitive or you think your barrier is inflamed beware don't go for it because the Sal acid might mess you up but AIC acid like I said regul Ates your anti-inflammatory properties and antibacterial properties and it helps as an antioxidant as well Dr Sam bunting across the pond in the UK has her Flawless nightly serum which is a 10% aoic acid serum as well it has 5% niacinamide it does have a Ester form of vitamin C at 2% so it's not going to be the active form of vitamin C but it might be a nice one if you are a rosacea sufferer trying to use vitamin see in the morning wanting to get away with some AIC acid I hear beautiful things I started looking into it because of you guys dming me about it so that is hers and then the ordinary this one's great at night when you have nowhere to go and you don't care who you're seeing it is a 10% a acid suspension you do kind of sometimes have to shake it I feel but it appears nice and elegant but it does pill after a while so do not be fooled by the first impression with this it's 11 bucks though so you not really go wrong and then like I said prescription number four hypochlorous acid you guys have started hearing about this all over Instagram Tik Tok YouTube I don't know what else you guys are on I can't keep up with the social media platforms but hypochlorous acid is one that has been used in medicine for decades I actually use it before every cosmetic procedure to clean my patients faces because it has antimicrobial effects and it is gentle so it's not going to over strip their skin like using plain oil isopropyl alcohol or an alcohol wipe it is now available in fancier forms at nicer stores but you can also get it at your local drugstore as a generic this is one that is available at Walgreens it is really not that expensive at all and you can use it every day on your face in the morning and at night if you're somebody who wears a mask for whatever reason at the height of the pandemic I used to spray my mask with hypoc chloris acid to minimize the breakout around the mouth area number five this is one that people don't often think of when they have rosacea a lot of people with rosacea think they have chronically dry skin over here it's always flaking but then when I ask my patients is your skin dry or oily they go it's more oily but it flakes okay it's not dry skin it's not flaking because it's dry it is a yeast living on your skin and you have dandruff of your face a lot of rosacea patients have dandruff of their face around their eyebrows right here in the corners of their nose or even along their eyelid margins and you can even see it sometimes in front of their ears and they need ketoconazol neral shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp that you can use a couple of times a week on your face to keep that yeast at Bay okay um it's an anti-fungal medicine that can help really help your face and I think when that is sort of subsided and you calm the subar dermatitis down you minimize the inflammation associated with it and your redness gets better in the long run so this is something that you're going to have to incorporate throughout the course of your life and you have to figure out the Cadence of how you want to incorporate it the shampoo is not necessarily the best as a face wash because it's not the ideal pH it might be a little bit stripping but if you use it several times periodically maybe twice a week maybe it's four times a week maybe it's once a week I don't know what the right Cadence is for you and you do it in the areas that are actually the worst letting it sit for a few minutes before washing it off you will see a huge difference in your skin in the long run also just side note I use the shampoo right here I've been using it right here when I wash my hair I let it sit for 5 minutes not because I have dandruff but because I have thinning hair there and I have noticed that my hair is starting to get thicker poor AI okay number six benzil peroxide and you're going to go wait wait wait wait wait is benzil peroxide and adne medication yes it is is it great for rosacea no it's not but if you have this little Mite called a Demodex Mite out of control on your face then benzil peroxide can be helpful for you now not all rosacea people have Demodex mites going crazy on their face but a lot of them do and the way I hear it described from my patients is that they feel like their skin is a little bit reactive and itchy not painful not irrit ated but just like this is probably the get your mind out of the gutter okay but this is probably the best action I can describe it as okay but benzil peroxide can help kill it now you don't need a 10% benzil peroxide wash stronger isn't better something like at 5% we have this in my office is great it's going to help kill that bacteria the little mites and keep it at Bay all right FYI because of the drug fact label benzil peroxide comes up as acne but this can be helpful for Demodex mites as well okay number seven my favorite zinc oxide no it's not sunscreen I'm talking about diaper rash cream Triple Paste zinc oxide is a beautiful ingredient it has anti-inflammatory effects when a kid has a rash down there you slap this all over their little tushies in a gentle way in order to minimize their rash to calm the inflammation down so they have less friction Etc on their privates when it comes to your face if you have an inflamed Skin Barrier and you're trying to restore your barrier zinc oxide can really help restore that barrier and when it comes in the form of a diaper rash cream when it's married to petrolatum it will help create an occlusive layer while calming any inflammation down and it works wonders as an overnight mask treatment especially in a dry climate or in a very cold climate or when the temperatures are changing not all diaper rash creams are created equal don't go for one with essential oils definitely don't and make sure there's no steroid in it cuz that can make things worse I was sponsored by this company after I spoke about them it was a very organic thing and that's why I took that sponsorship because I was like how funny Would it be that the one sponsorship I'm excited about is a buttpaste company but this is probably my favorite one not because of that sponsorship I have two kids who are six and four I wasn't sponsored then but this was the one that I used on my kids so that is the diaper rash cream k for that and then we're going to talk about options for quickly prescriptions but we're not going to waste too much time on this because you can't prescribe medications for yourselves at least not as of yet but who knows what the future holds but aik acid 15% that's great you want to incorporate that metronidazol is a topical antibiotic that you guys can use it's been very well studied for rosacea it is also beautiful and santra which is the trade name the generic name is itin is an antiparasitic that also kills Demodex I often times prescribe all three and I tell patients go plop ploop ploop put three dots mix mix mix apply to face twice a day and it really does help a lot with people with rosacea to help keep all of it at Bay and you can use this long term you can use aoic acid when you're pregnant you can use metronidazol when you're pregnant and last I checked you can use cilantro when you're pregnant in office we can take it up a notch and you guys can really help yourselves by reducing the Cosmetic look of redness by getting the beams vascular laser beams also pulse known as the pulse die laser which in my book is the gold standard you guys might get Groupon deals for ipls or bbls for rosacea it doesn't work as well an IPL and a BBL is a light it is not a laser you're going to need a lot more treatments and you better be going to somebody who is qualified because you might get burnt in the process because they are not as specific as a laser and you need to know what you're doing with them in order to treat your rosacea correctly and then if you have enlarged sweat glands on your nose or on your chin you can do electr surgery you can shave it down people actually use sandpaper believe it or not in conjunction with other devices and lasers to help minimize the look of that but you're probably not watching this video I am assuming if that is your case and you have timeus changes on your nose um because it's usually older white men who get that so I don't think they're watching this YouTube um but that is pretty much what we can do the bird ey view in office and the last thing I want to just say is rosacea might appear like a very benign chronic condition but it has a really deep psychological influence and psychosocial impact on people knowing that you're flushing when you're embarrassed makes you more embarrassed and makes it worse as somebody who has had 10 V beams in one year yes 10 why because I would go to the gym and I would get stopped on the street when I was working out and they would ask me do you need to go to the hospital are you okay cuz I looked like a beat I wasn't red I was like purple red and so I told myself let me just treat this with the vbm and I ended up doing 10 one year and I maintain it probably with one or two treatments a year now I treat my whole face it is really psychologically draining thinking oh my God are my emotions showing on my face and my ears

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as well thank you so much for watching don't forget to like this video And subscribe to the channel and I'll see you next time foreign",

        "transcript": "[Music] hello my name is dr sam ellis and i am a board certified dermatologist welcome to my bathroom in addition to practicing both medical and cosmetic dermatology in northern california i am also an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at uc davis and i'm a consultant for skin care companies and i help them develop products that are evidence-based tonight i am going to be taking you through my anti-aging skincare routine [Music] now a lot of people kind of bristle at the anti-aging term and what i mean is not that i don't want you to be getting older as a physician i i want to get older i want my patients to be getting older because the alternative is not great but you might not want your skin to look weathered or tired i want my skin to be plump and youthful and healthy and that is what this skincare routine is all about but in sort of a low maintenance streamlined way all right we've got the towel on the hair is back we are ready to rock and roll with a nighttime skincare routine a little bit of background about my skin is that it's not particularly oily it is not particularly dry it is somewhat sensitive because i have a skin condition called rosacea which makes me prone to redness and flushing especially with a glass of wine but i don't get the pimples that some people with rosacea do get which is really lucky for me but i do have to be mindful that some products do irritate my skin and that i'm a little bit more sun sensitive i also spent my whole life outside i'm from california i was a swimmer and i played water polo through college so i have a lot of sun damage that i have been working on for the past several years but that is also something that i'm trying to tackle in my nighttime skincare routine so the first step of any skincare routine in the evening is going to be cleansing your skin the whole point of this is to remove all of the junk and debris that have built up on your skin over the day maybe take off makeup or sunscreen not or sunscreen definitely sunscreen if you don't have sunscreen on your face we're gonna have a problem but you need something to take that all off because if that's just sitting on your skin while you sleep that's gonna clog your pores make you more prone to breakouts it's going to make your skin look dull so you need to cleanse that off and the other part of cleansing that's important is that it sets your skin up to absorb and interact with the next set of products that you're going to put on it i am a huge fan of the double cleanse and i feel like if you're watching this you probably know what a double cleanse is but for those who don't the double cleanse is basically a two-step cleansing process where you use a more oil-based cleanser to remove that top layer of debris that's on your skin and break up some of the product and then you use a second cleanser usually a water-based cleanser to wash that all away so today i am going to be using the clinique take the day off cleansing balm as my first cleansing step it's not waxy it's almost creamy but holds its shape and then as you put it into your hands you can see the warmth from the body just melts it all away but all that product is still sitting here and i'm going to massage it into my face and the whole point is to really just break up that product and you can start to see my tinted moisturizer coming off you can see that redness of my skin underneath but i like to see the redness because then i know that my makeup is getting removed so i usually will take this up onto my forehead in the eyebrows i usually grab a little bit more for my eyes i feel like breaking up the eye makeup is so important you don't want today's mascara to become tomorrow's eyeliner because if you've ever fallen asleep with your makeup on you know what i'm talking about and if you haven't then that probably made zero sense to you so i'm just massaging really gently and delicately around this i'm going over my eyelashes and really trying to press the product down and away in a second i'll peek and see what kind of scary mess i've created oh yeah that's good that's really good and so at this point everything's broken up i'm gonna get it wet i'll just get my fingers damp and then we do something called an emulsifying process where i add a little bit of water to the product and you can see it turns kind of white and creamy and that really helps with the cleansing that water grabs onto the product and the product grabs onto the dirt and oil and makeup and sunscreen and lotion that's on your face and now i'm going to dip down and cleanse see in a second got all of that cleansed off and now i'm ready for my second step of the double cleanse but you can see like i don't really have eye makeup on anymore you can start to see the texture and the color of my skin meaning that i feel confident that my makeup has been removed with that step for my second step i'm going to use the vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin i hope there's some still in here i use this a lot yeah we're good so this cleanser is sort of like a pearlescent gel i really like it i feel like i need a lather in my facial cleanser at least one of the steps i might have been brainwashed by the cosmetic industry i don't care to me this makes it feel like something is really happening i like this cleanser because it's sort of a no-nonsense it's not an exfoliating cleanser it's really just the purpose is to get your face clean so i just kind of massage it go down my neck normally i would do this stuff in the shower so usually i would do my cleansing balm emulsify it and then hop in the shower wash my face and body in the shower and then come back out and do the rest of my routine but if i take this into the shower this video is going to take on a whole nother life so this is all massaged in go over my eyelashes one more time make sure everything's really good drop back down it's going to rinse it off all right so the face has been cleansed and when i'm done cleansing my face i don't want it to feel dry or tight but i also don't want it to feel oily or particularly hydrated yet i just need it to feel ready to accept whatever i'm going to put on it next i feel like if your skin is feeling too dry or tight after you cleanse you might need to switch your cleanser either to one that has a lower ph so something in the five to six range sometimes a more basic cleanser that sits more at the seven to eight range and the ph can be more stripping for the skin and although some skin can handle that a lot of people can't and so that's one thing to look for in your cleanser if you're noticing you're feeling really dry the other thing is that you can look for ingredients like glycerin or shea butter in your cleanser because those are hydrating ingredients that can support your skin while you wash once i've cleansed i'm in the home stretch that is honestly the thing that takes the longest in my entire routine the next thing i'm going to do is put on my trusted tretinoin so this is a retinoid this is a prescription strength retinoid and you can see this tube is very well loved so well loved that i am worried about getting some out of the tube right now a little more all right we're good pea sized amount that's all you need it takes me a while to get through one of those tubes because that's all you need for your entire face so when i'm putting a retinoid on i do the dot method i think this is not new for any body but that helps me sort of distribute it but a little goes a really long way with this product i just put any extra that's on my fingertips kind of down my neck the neck skin is so much more sensitive than facial skin because it does not have the same density of hair and oil glands that the face has so it doesn't have the same repair abilities and so you have to be really careful with the neck because you go in with 0.05 tretinoin and you might be sorry the other thing i will sometimes use on my neck is like a retinol so a retinol is a not prescription strength retinoid it is something that's weaker than tretinoin because it has to be converted in the skin into retinoic acid it has to be converted into tretinoin and therefore in that conversion it gets weakened quite a bit and so sometimes i'll go in with that on my neck or even around my eyes i don't want to spend too much time talking about retinoids even though they are amazing because you could probably find a million excellent videos here that go into more detail but essentially retinoids are vitamin a derived compounds that are the best thing you can do to anti-age your skin in terms of product besides wearing sunscreen which is in a category and a class all on its own so retinoids which include things like retinol retinal adaptolene teseratine triferitine tretinoin they can be over the counter or prescription and they do it all they support collagen synthesis so they help you make new collagen which makes your skin bouncy and glowy and less saggy fewer fine lines fewer wrinkles they help break up pigmentation in the skin they support new vessel growth and a lot of people are like oh i don't want new vessels but deeper in the skin which can really make your skin glow the other thing that they can do is they can actually fight something called cellular atypia so as your body is exposed to more uv damage over your life the cells in your top layer of skin can start misbehaving and that's what leads to skin cancer so as part of a skin cancer prevention treatment i put a lot of my patients on a topical retinoid retinoids increase collagen synthesis so collagen is the protein in our skin that makes it look bouncy and glowy and in our mid-20s we lose one percent of our collagen in our skin per year which is devastating so how do we combat that using a retinoid is the best way and that is why it is a staple in my routine it will never leave my routine unless i was trying to get pregnant or if i was pregnant the reason for that is that these are vitamin a derived compounds and they have been shown when taken orally to cause birth defects so no anti-aging in the world is worth a birth defect a lot of people will caution about using retinoids when someone's breastfeeding i personally would have no problem using a retinoid while i'm breastfeeding i'm not worried about a birth defect at that point the baby is out so just don't put it on your nipples and you'll be fine so most nights i will use a retinoid maybe once or twice a week depending if i feel like my skin is looking dull or if i just want to like a little extra i will do an exfoliating step instead of my retinoid i never use a chemical exfoliator plus a retinoid in the same night that is too much and overkill but one of my favorite chemical exfoliants are these peel pads by skin better they are a combination of lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid and then their own proprietary retinoid blend but when you take one of these and you swipe it over your face you get the sting okay that's the sting that tells you something's going down on your skin in a positive way i would not recommend doing a retinoid and this in the routine unless you're used to it basically otherwise you're going to over exfoliate your skin you're going to over aggravate your skin but for me i've been using a retinoid for six or seven years at this point and i need another exfoliating agent to just get some of that dead skin cell layer off the top so i can have a true glow and doing a peel pad or some type of exfoliating step usually a chemical exfoliating step not a physical scrub is what i like to do in my routine to just give me a little glow next after my retinoid is on i go in with a moisturizer this is the la roche-posay tolerane ultra this is a super mild but very hydrating moisturizer this is like five pumps i want a lot okay this is super thick and creamy it's basically like a pumpable cream usually i tell patients creams come in jars they're thick like frosting this is just just below that it is the thickest lotion you can imagine and i i adore this now it's on the back well this is going to be really smooth tomorrow but i probably use four or five times more moisturizer than i do of a retinoid i want more of it oh it just feels so good i like this because it feels really nourishing and no matter how angry or upset or if my rosacea's flared or if i overdid it with my retinoid and my skin feeling temperamental this never ever stings and i really appreciate that about this product i also see a lot of patients in my clinic who have sensitive skin who have allergies to things like fragrance or certain preservatives and this product just doesn't have any of those so i always feel really confident recommending it to people with sensitive skin because i think they'll be successful the only time i might not use something this sick is someone who's really acne prone who has a ton of clogged pores because it does have a lot of moisturizing and occlusive ingredients in it but oh i love it feels so good all right so retinoid is on moisturizer is on that's it it's the one two punch i mean it's pretty darn simple i do use something called azelaic acid in the morning to help combat my rosacea and i use vitamin c and sunscreen but in the evening for anti-aging retinoid and moisturizer now i don't exclusively rely on my skin care to contribute to my anti-aging plan or goals i do use neuromodulators so botox in my face to help with fine lines and wrinkles and creasing that happens over time i also do a mild resurfacing laser a few times a year something called clear and brilliant which helps break up pigment in my skin and also supports collagen synthesis the last thing i do is something called pulse dye laser so pulse dye laser is a laser that targets redness and you're probably looking at me going well i can see redness in your face oh you you can't even imagine what it would look like without the laser okay uh these tools that we have in a dermatology office are not to help someone achieve true you know there's no such thing as perfect we're just trying to optimize make someone feel more confident you don't need to look like an instagram filter that's not even a realistic goal you just need to look like you and feel confident in your own skin and sometimes a little enhancement never hurts anybody but i just want to be totally just totally transparent and that i get support from in-office procedures and i don't exclusively rely on my skin care if you're someone that does bravo but if you're someone who doesn't bravo to round out my nighttime skincare routine we cannot neglect the lips oftentimes i'll actually put my moisturizer on over my lips as well just to start softening them and then i'll go in with something more occlusive so something with a more jelly like or vaseline texture to really lock everything in so i'm going to use my aquaphor oldie but a goodie as you can see that's like a pretty thick i mean it's 40 vaseline or petrolatum excuse me and so i'll just put that on my lips to get everything nice and hydrated the rest i rub on my cuticles so in a clinic day you know i see 20 to 35 patients in a day and i wash my hands probably a hundred times that's sadly not even an exaggeration and so my hands take a huge beating so part of my nighttime routine focuses on my hands so anytime i showed you any of these steps any leftover got rubbed down my neck on and onto the back of my hands and that's really important to me but now i've got my retinoid on my moisturizer on the skin has been properly cleansed the lips are feeling juicy i think i'm getting ready to go to bed that's it thank you so much for following along in my nighttime anti-aging low maintenance skincare routine i just wanted to show you that even as a dermatologist who has access to all of the things this is what i choose now just because that's what my routine is it doesn't mean that's what your routine has to be but you should know that you can work smarter not harder and that an effective skincare routine does not have to be extensive or expensive it can be if you want it to but it certainly doesn't have to be if you would like more skincare tips from me and just to follow me around the office see what the day in the life of a dermatologist is like hear me talk about dermatologic procedures and medical dermatology you should follow me on instagram my handle is super creative it's at dr samantha ellis i would love to see you there this has been a blast and a huge honor thank you so much for having me bye",

        "transcript": "good morning good morning welcome back to the Vlog today I am GNA of course start my skincare routine and I was thinking about those of you out there with Rosa you deal with burning stinging symptoms of sensitivity when you use your skincare products with rosacea people develop redness on the cheeks little bumps that are red and filled with pus but in people who have deeper skin tones those skin signs sometimes are missed um or are not as obvious especially to the untrained eye and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up getting misdiagnosed and they have rosacea so talking about symptoms with your doctor is one of the most helpful pieces of information for guiding the diagnosis of Ros but symptoms include burning stinging itch sensations of warmth in the face that come and go as well as discomfort in the eyes and of course problems with skin care products and cosmetics if you have rosacea cleansing can be a really delicate tricky balance because definitely can burn and sting and can wear away at your already kind of weaken Skin Barrier to make those symptoms of sensitivity worse a lot of cleansers burn and sting so use a really gentle mild creamy cleanser if you're feeling really sensitive use lukewarm water and try just washing your face once a day cleansing oils and cleansing balms are a great option to remove um dirt oil and Cosmetics first because they're less likely to burn and sting got to get the drips off all right I'm coming in with the healthy renew face serum I've really been enjoying this now this would be a good option for a lightweight hydrating serum if you have sensitive skin because this whole product line is meant for people with sensitive skin and it's moisturizing to help minimize the symptoms of sensitivity but it's this particular Serum is not heavy sometimes heavy moisturizers for people with rosacea can actually elicit a flush not everyone but some people so the face cream in this line I really like but it is very rich so if you are sensitive to really heavy moisturizers and you want something more lightweight go with the serum for my sunscreen today I'm going to use a cavey hydrating sheer sunscreen I reviewed this a while ago it's a hybrid sunscreen it's water resistant um it's all right um but I want to use it up you know I buy these products to try out and review and then I want to make sure I finish them so they don't go to waste this hybrid sunscreen is more the consistency is more of a almost a fluid it kind of is like a cross between a fluid and a cream hybrid sunscreen just means zinc plus some organic AKA chemical filters so the cast in I find is a lot less noticeable in comparison to an all mineral but I also find that these hybrid sunscreens are a lot less likely to sting in comparison to the organic AKA chemical sunscreens so if you find that organic sunscreens chemical sunscreens burn sting but you're put off by the heavy white cast of an all mineral sunscreen try a hybrid sunscreen it's a nice balance it's not a zero cast though if you have a deeper skin tone it will show up but it is a lot less noticeable and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up using the hybrid sunscreens and they say you know after a while it just kind of Blends in and it's not so bad it all depends on your background skin tone though I wish these Brands would provide samples that way you know how it's going to look on your skin before you buy the bottle because while I like to think my reviews help you guys in deciding whether or not you're going to buy something or not you can't really tell just looking at how a product looks on my skin how it's necessarily going to look for you anytime somebody leaves a comment in any one of my videos like saying is this a good sunscreen for oily skin almost always either on a video or like a Tik Tok or something almost always there'll be someone who's like I've got oily skin I love this it's my Holy Grail then there'll be another P person who's like no stay away it's too greasy it's too oily so even those you know those kinds of things it's like you kind of just have to try it for yourself honestly um to see if it ends up working this one is a little bit shiny it's water resistant though which is nice like for humidity and sweat easy to tolerate around the eyes for me again that's another very individualized thing one thing too about sunscreen is that it also helps with the impaired skin barrier and helps reduce symptoms of sensitivity once you have it on there because it's you know helping to reduce water loss and limit penetration and irritance into the skin it's almost like a barrier cream in a sense depending on the consistency especially and sunscreens like this with zinc um are soothing you know zinc can be is anti-inflammatory although some zinc sunscreens are in my experience and yours cuz you guys have told me on the drawing side so I mentioned to you guys the other day that this like new thing that I've been enjoying doing is listening to my audio book which I'm still making my way through um it's called Uh Crossroads anyway so at night to unwind like when I'm making dinner I like to put my headphones on and just listen to the audiobook it kind of helps me tune out and like keeps me from you know Doom scrolling in my mind of just like things that I need to do and it just helps me inwind anyway but you know something about that like you've got to wash behind your ears is the point I'm trying to make like it's a it's an area where a lot of people end up forgetting to wash but um especially if you're wearing headphones a lot because back here you can get a lot of oily buildup and CC dermatitis I actually like to use an anti-dandruff shampoo back here to to clean behind my ears this is an area where you know similar to dandruff on your scalp and SE dermatitis on your face you can get this oily flaky itchy inflame buildup so I like to do that and when you're wearing headphones a lot that creates a moist humid environment that's really more favorable for that little yees malesia so it can make you know this kind of problem behind the ears even more of an issue for you so stay on top of clean it behind your ears kids so I bought this blood pressure monitor cuff on Amazon I've been pretty happy with it because it will syn to an app on your phone so you can keep a log of your blood pressure and heart rate I find that is something that's really useful a useful metric like I'm not I try to not get too into like tracking all these Health metrics because it's sort of like what are you going to do with all that information then you just become like you know somebody who just writes down numbers all the time like how many steps you got in a day like how many hours of sleep and it just becomes like to what end you know what I mean but uh all that to say having a Rec of your blood pressure readings over a period of time it can be a very useful information uh to provide to your doctor because a lot of people um deal with what they call white coat hypertension meaning your blood pressure goes up in the doctor's office cuz maybe you're nervous stressed out um they call it white coat hypertension like because they attribute it to being nervous about the doctor but honestly it's gotten to a point where the amount of time you have to wait in a doctor's office is so frustrating that it gets your blood pressure up too so it should be like um you know waiting room waiting room hypertension like the stress of of having to wait anyway um so I got this and I've been really happy with it the cuff is um standard size and it it also will fit a large larger arm and it's been doing well so yeah it's it's useful and I I think you know like I said what what good are all these numbers well like if you go to the doctor's office and you have a higher a blood pressure reading on the higher end they're probably you know going to tell you to maybe check it again and you know it can kind of be a thing so having this and having a record to show them is really helpful because a lot of times your blood pressure will will run a certain way and it'll be very different in the office so that's handy to have I've got my little pumpkin back there I'm still burning the Tuscany trick-or treat candle the cupcake one it's not my favorite favorite scent I think I've complained about this already in multiple Vlogs and I have re I purchased a new another candle on their Halloween set that I'm I'm itching to buy I'm itching to to light into but I have this thing in my personality where like with the candle I'm going to burn it unless it's like really really foul which this is isn't it's just kind of like you know I know Tuscany can give a better candle profile um unless it's just really foul I'm going to burn that thing all the way and I'm not going to start a new candle until I finished it some people burn more than one candle at a time and let the the fragrances like mingle and I bet that's really nice if you get the right pairing but I'm always like on the fence about if I should do that or if it's going to be like weird and and and mess things up like I think one of my favorite to skinny candles is the Lemon sugar cookie and I really think that the lemon sugar cookie would be nice over like some of those more Berry scents I think that would be like a nice kind of way to blend those two but I don't know what would go good with cupcake maybe a cinnamon scented candle so it was a gorgeous day on this Sunday I had to get out I could not spend it inside as you can see the sky is really really blue and gorgeous I'm over by the River Oaks neighborhood where they're all these Mansions I love to drive by these houses and just Ogle them lot of them have these like massive walls in front of them so you can't really see them too well but over the holidays this neighborhood is really fun to come to because they go all out lighting up their mansions and they all look beautiful uh it's just something to see something to behold I wanted to go to Memorial Park um and so that's a bit of a drive but it kind of ended up to be a fail because actually I could not find a parking space uh because everybody wanted to get out which like I've said in other Vlogs I try and get outside as much as possible during the day it's actually really good for your sleep cycle for your mental health to get outside in during daylight hours and spend time Outdoors uh as much as possible like especially if you work swing shifts can really help set your clock back so because I couldn't find a place to park I ended up coming over to Rice Village uh area and they have that nice walking trail uh getting some Cloud footage here I just think it's so Zen but I used to walk around this uh Park a lot um in my older apartment but I I haven't been here in a while it's always a fun time let me know in the comments I think some of you went to Rice so hopefully this footage brings back fond memories of your own stomping grounds but uh I love the pretty oak trees that line This walking path I did not know that this existed this Garden back here it's for the students but I had to come and check it out they have all sorts of beautiful flowers the garden was actually closed but you can it is open to the I guess open to the public um during certain hours yeah here's a little sign I guess um some alumni donated money for this garden and the idea is like to have a space for students to come and like learn about gardening so maybe one day they will have their own garden all right so I am going to show you guys some double cleansing in action here uh this particular night I decided I was going to use I've been using that DHC deep cleansing oil that I got from sty and I have rather been enjoying it it's very similar to the hot alabo cleansing oil um similar ingredients like olive oil but it has an aroma to it to it it has I think it has Rosemary in it so you can definitely smell that but it's a pleasant cleansing oil to use one of the reasons I love using cleansing oil so much is they're just a effective at removing Cosmetics like on this particular day I'm wearing uh that Lancome adol mascara I'm also wearing their waterproof eyeliner and this really does a good job getting in there dissolving it breaking it up I can't do makeup removers I always burn my eyes sting my skin if you have rosacea we were talking about this at the beginning of the Vlog but if you have rosacea um and you're looking for a way to remove makeup try cleansing oil or cleansing balm alternatively another good option is Cold Cream like the pwns cold cream is really a good option because it dissolves the makeup but it also is like very soothing um I don't you know they call it cold cream and it does kind of feel nice and chilled going on the skin but the oil is another option or a cleansing balm the main difference between like cleansing balm and cleansing oil it's just the balm is solid at room temperature I also started using the um isant yam root vegan milk cleanser oh my gosh those of you with sensitive skin rosacea consider this mild cleanser because it's such a pleasant experience it's free of fragrance it's very hydrating it has this like slippery texture to it which may be offputting for some but I really enjoy it it almost kind of cloaks your skin in a hug as it Glides across the surface of the skin and gently cleanses without disrupting the underlying Skin Barrier you see with the double cleanse approach the first step the oil cleanser is kind of just like getting in there and breaking up residue buildup on the skin surface the second step with the mild cleanser is actually getting in there and cleansing everything away so that's why I like doing it that way typically I do the second step in the shower but I decided to do it here so you guys could see this cleanser in action and as you can see it took everything off well hey guys I am all clean moisturized hydrated got my tread noan on but um one of the things I was thinking about you know on Sundays I do a Q&A over on my Instagram and I also post it to Facebook or basically I just you know post a still image of myself and I say hey drop any skincare related questions in the comments of this Instagram post or this Facebook post and I will usually answer you know a handful of them as many as I can and I post the question and the response to my Instagram stories and it's saved in a highlight bubble if you go to my Instagram profile anyway one of the questions I got today was like how do you deal with dry eyelids especially if you live in a cold dry climate and I got to tell you petroleum jelly is a game Cher for dry eyelids or eyelid eczema because it prevents water loss really well and it also um prevents penetration of irritance into the skin so it really is a is a great option plus it's free of common allergens and irritant I mean it's basically your immune system really doesn't care about Vaseline so that's a good thing it's just like an inert little barrier support there it's really underrated for all the things you can do it's also beneficial for cutting down on chafing wind bur if you live somewhere cold and windy um what a day y'all today was gorgeous like so nice when the weather is beautiful because you just want to be outside and so soaking it all in and such a mood boost I'm telling you summertime here can get a little like you know winter months get in other places because it's really just too hot to safely be outside for long stretches of time so you kind of get a little you know the a bit of the Blues in the summertime but that being said I really love summer and I find that you know I'm happy as can be throughout the summer cuz I like all of the summer festivities like the summer holidays and summer food summer fruits I really like summer and I love the beach so I don't know winter here I I don't mind because it's pretty mild but winter is not not where it's at for in my mind like no thanks uh I'm not I'm not Team Winter I do like winter when I don't have to go anywhere then it's fine you know it's like all cozy with a fireplace and my coffee and it's relaxing sure winter time sounds Divine but the realities of existing places that have strong you know intense Winters no thank you I don't want to be out there shoving now no thanks defrosting uh the windshield I hate doing that uh I hate driving in icy conditions cuz it's not fun although I got really good at driving in snow when I lived in Colorado like I had this little trick sometimes I get stuck in the snow like in a parking space like you'd park somewhere and then maybe you'd be parked there for a while and then we get a huge dumping of snow and you kind of have to dig your car out the car I had at the time I remember I would get in it and you know you kind of like try and dig some of the snow out as best you could heat up the car so it was somewhat def you know defrosted and then I remember I would like move it forward and back and forward and back and then I would like myself I would I could rock my own car and I could get it to rock out of the out of the space and float away I got good at that you know there's certain things that are really intimidating but once you learn how to do them and you just become comfortable and it becomes a necessity that you do it and do it efficiently then it's like not a big deal anymore like parallel parking is one of those things where you just put yourself in that situation and get uncomfortable a handful of times eventually it will just be like no big deal um that's that's a lot of things like if there's anything that you are intimidated about doing or you're like apprehensive you just kind of have to throw yourself in that situation and I mean provided it's not like hazardous to your health or something you know what I mean like within reason just throw yourself in that situation and be uncomfortable for a couple of times and eventually it just be such a non-issue that you'll start doing it all the time and you'll look back and be like why was I ever freaked out about doing this it's like non B deal all right y'all I am going to wrap this Vlog up I've had a great day I hope you have had a great day thank you so much for watching to the end if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

H: I try to think about it\u00a0\nlike does this ingredient\u00a0\u00a0 give back to my skin or does it take from it M: what are some of your\u00a0\nfavorites for calming down\u00a0\u00a0 irritated skin and supporting your skin barrier? H: panthenol glycerin and hyaluronic acid so\u00a0\nthose are hydrating panthenol's a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 soothing as well niacinamide everyone's fave\u00a0\nbut not too much like five percent not 10 or 20 and then there's barrier support so we\u00a0\nhave ceramides cholesterol or you might\u00a0\u00a0 see phytosphingosine so that's a lipid\u00a0\nyou find in the outer layer of your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and it helps to give back to your skin\u00a0\nthose lipids that it's mainly missing then we have soothing ingredients so my faves\u00a0\u00a0 are definitely oat and also centella so\u00a0\n\"cica\" madecassoside and copper peptide M: so moving on to specific products I don't know if I told you this but your\u00a0\nserum actually made me realize how there\u00a0\u00a0 were lots of actives for irritated skin because\u00a0\nI used your serum and it was lovely on my skin and then I looked at the ingredients\u00a0\nlist and there was so much stuff in there so side note I did not invite Hannah onto this\u00a0\nvideo because she's my friend and I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 plug her serum we are going to talk about other\u00a0\nproducts but this was like a revelation to me so the serum is water-based and most of the\u00a0\ntime water-based serums really sting when my\u00a0\u00a0 skin barrier is compromised and this did not\u00a0\nit just felt so lovely so my mind was blown H: I feel like the oat is doing\u00a0\na lot of the lifting there my skin was stressed out while we were\u00a0\nworking on it so it was good for me to\u00a0\u00a0 test but what I wanted was something\u00a0\nthat would feel calming on contact I definitely did feel like there was a gap\u00a0\nthat was not much you could get especially\u00a0\u00a0 in Australia that would hydrate calm and support\u00a0\nyour barrier that didn't feel like thick and balmy M: I really love how lightweight\u00a0\nit is and how well it layers and\u00a0\u00a0 like just the fact that there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market I've been using this a few times\u00a0\na week even when my skin isn't\u00a0\u00a0 that irritated because it just\u00a0\nfits into my routine so nicely M: what are your other favorite\u00a0\nproducts for when your skin's irritated? H: I really like the la roche\u00a0\nposay cicaplast sheet masks you\u00a0\u00a0 put it on your face and it just\u00a0\nfeels calm it's hydrated it's\u00a0\u00a0 the best even after treatments you\u00a0\nknow when your skin feels really hot M: so I personally just don't really enjoy sheet\u00a0\nmasks because I don't like the feeling of them\u00a0\u00a0 sliding down my face so I love the cicaplast baume\u00a0\nB5 which is getting reformulated to the B5 plus I picked up one up in Europe and so far\u00a0\nit seems to be pretty similar on my skin\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a little bit lighter but I have\u00a0\nheard different things from other people a lot of people have told me that they really\u00a0\u00a0 like the cicaplast serum as well but I\u00a0\nhaven't tried that enough to really say there are a lot of other centella products that\u00a0\nare formulated for this sort of skin recovery\u00a0\u00a0 phase as well from brands like bioderma\u00a0\nand there's quite a few in K Beauty too H: I quite like NIOD's copper\u00a0\npeptide but the lipid which is\u00a0\u00a0 a sort of gel it's great because\u00a0\nsort of a one and done PM routine Beauty Bay make this moisturizer that's oat\u00a0\u00a0 it's called Thirst Class it's kind of a\u00a0\nbit richer so I would use it in winter M: yeah I think oat is just really underrated I\u00a0\nused to make this DIY oat mask back in the day\u00a0\u00a0 that was just ground up oatmeal mixed with\u00a0\nwater and I would just slap it on my skin it has a lot of hydrating actives and\u00a0\navenanthramides which are really soothing H: if you're fancy the Cosmetics\u00a0\n27 baume 27 which is sort of like\u00a0\u00a0 a healing oil balm really beautiful it\u00a0\nhas essential oils but they're chamomile\u00a0\u00a0 calendula those calming ones not the\u00a0\nhectic lavender or anything like that laneige cream skin beautiful\u00a0\ndoesn't have many ingredients M: I really love that one too\u00a0\nit's really lightweight and\u00a0\u00a0 less ingredients just cuts down\u00a0\nthat chance of skin reactions along the same lines with less\u00a0\ningredients but a bit heavier\u00a0\u00a0 there's also Vaseline and Aquaphor\u00a0\nwhich is mostly just petroleum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 and they're water free so there's\u00a0\nlike a lot less chance of stinging there's also CeraVe healing ointment\u00a0\nand the QV sting free ointment which\u00a0\u00a0 is like the Australian version of that\u00a0\nand they both have ceramides in them too I also really like using face oils\u00a0\nwhen I have that compromised skin\u00a0\u00a0 barrier because of the lack of water\u00a0\nit just doesn't tend to sting as much H: the paula's choice advanced\u00a0\nreplenishing toner I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 reminds me of laneige cream skin only\u00a0\nit's packed with antioxidants as well\u00a0\u00a0 so it can almost be your am serum\u00a0\nif you want a bunch of antioxidants I quite like my LED mask as well so I\u00a0\nhave one that's red and near infrared I\u00a0\u00a0 find when I use it regularly my skin is just\u00a0\nmore resilient and can tolerate more things I get a little bit tired in\u00a0\nthe evening so you just put\u00a0\u00a0 it on and then you've done skincare\u00a0\nand it's one less layer on your face M: I mentioned before that you have to avoid\u00a0\nretinoids exfoliants and vitamin C but there\u00a0\u00a0 are gentler versions of those so what is your\u00a0\npolicy on using these when your skin's irritated? H: it really depends for me on how irritated my\u00a0\u00a0 skin is but but I do have some\u00a0\ngentler versions of my actives la roche C10 is an example that\u00a0\none has 10% vitamin C but also\u00a0\u00a0 their neurosensine peptide and a\u00a0\nbit of salicylic acid so I have\u00a0\u00a0 literally never had an issue with that\u00a0\nproduct and I have issues with vitamin C and if I wanted a retinoid the kiehls\u00a0\nmicrodose it's enough to have an effect\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not enough to cause any issues so\u00a0\nthat's also a perfect beginner retinoid in\u00a0\u00a0 general and it has ceramides to\u00a0\nreplenish your skin as it works M: I also really like using derivatives of\u00a0\nvitamin C and A where my skin's irritated\u00a0\u00a0 because while there is less evidence\u00a0\nfor them working they are a lot gentler which I guess could be because they're not working\u00a0\nas well but it is like a nice fallback option my favorite less irritating derivatives for\u00a0\nvitamin C are ascorbyl glucoside magnesium\u00a0\u00a0 ascorbyl phosphate and thda or\u00a0\natip which are the same thing and for vitamin A I like granactive retinoid for gentle chemical exfoliation I like\u00a0\nusing polyhydroxy acids although I do\u00a0\u00a0 also sometimes use a very small amount of\u00a0\nsalicylic acid since it can be soothing but\u00a0\u00a0 you do have to be pretty careful because\u00a0\na lot of the formulas are quite harsh M: so one question I get asked a lot is\u00a0\nhow long do you generally have to wait\u00a0\u00a0 for your barrier to fix itself before\u00a0\nyou can go back to your usual products H: I am getting pretty good at repairing mine\u00a0\u00a0 and recognizing the signs before I\u00a0\ntruly obliterate it so a week or two recently I had a facial where it was an enzyme\u00a0\nexfoliant and it was like a bit scrubby and\u00a0\u00a0 I felt a bit tingly around the mouth I\u00a0\nthought it would be fine it wasn't fine the next few days it was tingly and so I\u00a0\njust cut the actives for about two weeks previous times has taken me three months M: that is so long yeah I think it is just a lot easier to not\u00a0\nmess up your skin barrier in the first place the longest my skin has taken is probably a week\u00a0\u00a0 or two but it depends a lot\u00a0\non the type of irritation so with perioral dermatitis\u00a0\nusually that is maybe a day or two if my nose is peeling off after a cold\u00a0\nthen that will usually be over a week now with cleansers which ones\u00a0\ndo you like for irritated skin? H: I like to use fragrance free cleanses and\u00a0\nit's because if your barrier is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 compromised then things get in further and so\u00a0\nthey wouldn't normally irritate you but they can I like avene extremely gentle cleanser\u00a0\nI like biologique recherche lait u that\u00a0\u00a0 is the one that's for oily skin but it's a cream and I like a really soft washcloth so like\u00a0\nthat really flammable fluffy polyester M: I also like fragrance free\u00a0\ncleansers where my skin's irritated some of my favorites are from geek\u00a0\nand gorgeous hada labo and bondi sands all of those don't really strip\u00a0\nskin and like you said they have\u00a0\u00a0 moisturising ingredients\u00a0\nthat give back to the skin I also really like using bioderma micellar\u00a0\nwater with soft reusable cotton rounds the bioderma was specifically designed and tested\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin and reusable\u00a0\ncotton rounds are just really soft M: now we are Australians so of course\u00a0\nwe have to talk about sun protection what is your approach when your skin's irritated? H: there are a couple of sunscreens\u00a0\nI know not to use because I can feel\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit spicy on the cheeks if my\u00a0\nskin is irritated but generally I will\u00a0\u00a0 look for one that is formulated for sensitive skin I really like those European pharmacy\u00a0\nbrands ends that cater to this type of skin M: yeah I think there is this sort of\u00a0\nassumption that you have to use zinc\u00a0\u00a0 oxide if your skin's irritated but\u00a0\nsometimes that's not the best option\u00a0\u00a0 and newer sunscreen filters\u00a0\ncan be really non-irritating if you go into like a French pharmacy\u00a0\nyou'll see that all of their sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin sunscreens are actually all chemical\u00a0\nsunscreens they have those newer filters some people actually find zinc oxide\u00a0\nmore irritating because it is drying\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite irritating when you're\u00a0\nrubbing it in because it's so thick\u00a0\u00a0 and sticky and also just trying to\u00a0\nget it off with cleanser at the end on top of that they're not always truly free\u00a0\nfrom chemical sunscreens I've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this before but there are these SPF boosters\u00a0\nthat are in a lot of mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\u00a0 they have almost identical properties to a\u00a0\nlot of properly approved chemical sunscreens I've actually talked to quite a few\u00a0\npeople now who have told me that they\u00a0\u00a0 react to some mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\nnot others and then they checked and\u00a0\u00a0 they saw that the ones that they do\u00a0\nreact to have butyloctyl salicylate M: right what other tips and tricks\u00a0\ndo you have for irritated skin? H: I think a lot of people don't know\u00a0\nthat your skin it exfoliates itself right it's called desquamation and it does that\u00a0\nbetter when it is adequately hydrated so\u00a0\u00a0 I would always try to hydrate my\u00a0\nskin before I try to exfoliate it if it's flaking or something\u00a0\nlike that and you might find\u00a0\u00a0 that the flakes take care of themselves that way I also really like doing several\u00a0\nlayers of one toner putting several\u00a0\u00a0 layers of one product on is better\u00a0\nthan putting four or five different\u00a0\u00a0 products right less opportunity\u00a0\nto upset your skin freak it out M: I also find that with flaky skin\u00a0\nif I have to get rid of them before\u00a0\u00a0 putting on makeup then I will wet my\u00a0\nskin and use a peeling gel very very\u00a0\u00a0 carefully and just buff in tiny circles\u00a0\nand that seems to do the least damage but that is like a really emergency sort\u00a0\nof thing I wouldn't recommend doing that\u00a0\u00a0 regularly when your skin is compromised because\u00a0\nthe hydration technique is just so much safer M: you also gave me some really good tips for\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis which is a newer issue for me it's a red rash that comes up around\u00a0\nyour mouth and near the sides of your\u00a0\u00a0 nose and it's been coming up\u00a0\nmore because of mask wearing the extra humidity can lead to an impaired barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and imbalance microbes and that can\u00a0\ncontribute to perioral dermatitis so I've had to change a few things when it flares\u00a0\u00a0 up like adding a cleanser in the\u00a0\nmorning which I don't usually do when my skin is happy then extra\u00a0\ncleansing tends to mess it up more\u00a0\u00a0 and dehydrate my skin but when that\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis is flaring then\u00a0\u00a0 my skin's already messed up so cleansing\u00a0\nactually takes it back towards happy M: do you have any other tips? H: if you think it might be perioral\u00a0\ndermatitis never put steroids on it\u00a0\u00a0 that's a Dr Cara-ism it's my beloved dermatologist perioral dermatitis it's like imbalanced\u00a0\nmicrobiome but also it can happen from\u00a0\u00a0 steroid withdrawal because the steroids\u00a0\nput your immune system to sleep a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit your immune system was there sort\u00a0\nof keeping the microbiome in check M: speaking of microbiome I found that I\u00a0\nsometimes get very superficial folliculitis\u00a0\u00a0 on my body when my skin gets irritated\u00a0\nso like after exercising and I'm sweaty\u00a0\u00a0 and my clothes have been rubbing in my\u00a0\narmpits and in like my crotchal region and it's usually worse when I'm a bit\u00a0\nrun down from stress and lack of sleep basically this is when bacteria infect your hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles and you get red bumps with pus\u00a0\nthat look like shallow inflamed pimples for these I like to use a benzoyl\u00a0\nperoxide cleanser most of these are\u00a0\u00a0 meant for the face but dermatologists have been\u00a0\u00a0 recommending it for body folliculitis too\u00a0\nand it's been working really well for me I use it right after I exercise\u00a0\nand also when I'm having a flare\u00a0\u00a0 and just also not marinating\u00a0\nin sweaty clothes helps a lot but if it's really deep and painful\u00a0\nand not going away then definitely see\u00a0\u00a0 a doctor because you might need antibiotics or\u00a0\nsomething or it could be just not folliculitis M: now rosacea I get asked about this a lot and\u00a0\u00a0 it's a bit of a confusing condition\u00a0\nthat not a lot of people talk about so what is rosacea? H: rosacea is a chronic inflammatory\u00a0\nskin condition it's basically my\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist explained it to me as it's the blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels that are inflamed not the\u00a0\npores like you would have in acne you'll see visible blood vessels so those\u00a0\nlittle red ones are called telangiectasias\u00a0\u00a0 redness flushing so you'll see a symmetrical\u00a0\npattern of redness so mine comes and goes so you might get sort of a pimple like bump but it\u00a0\u00a0 won't be in the t-zone it will be around\u00a0\nthe cheeks and the nose in this pattern so it's like w zone not t-zone M: it gets confused a lot with acne and it\u00a0\ntends to show up from your late 20s onwards M: so how did you first\u00a0\nsuspect that you had rosacea? H: I was at an event and Dr Dennis\u00a0\nwas there and I said \"you know what\u00a0\u00a0 I'm always like flushing pink and red\u00a0\nthrough here sometimes through my cheeks what's going on? is that something I can treat?\" he's like \"well that's rosacea\" and I\u00a0\nwas like \"see ya\" I didn't want to know M: why should you actually\u00a0\nlook into managing rosacea? H: the thing about rosacea is that it progresses so you'll start with just the pink\u00a0\nand the flushing and maybe some\u00a0\u00a0 visible blood vessels around the nose\u00a0\nyou can get them in your cheeks too and then you'll start to get lesions\u00a0\nand you can also have it get into your\u00a0\u00a0 eyes and then it can progress\u00a0\nto thickened skin and swelling M: in terms of treating rosacea there\u00a0\nare over-the-counter options like\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid you should also\u00a0\nsee a dermatologist who has\u00a0\u00a0 experience with treating rosacea and\u00a0\nthey'll have other options available how else do you manage rosacea? H: Keeping on top of your skin barrier\u00a0\nand keeping that in check in place,\u00a0\u00a0 really supporting it is number one And avoiding triggers so you'll notice\u00a0\nwhen you start to flush from certain things the sun is a big one my skin hates the indoor heating - hates it alcohol some foods even spicy food is a big one\u00a0\u00a0 especially for like pale people\u00a0\nthat only eat meat and vegetables some medicines even do it your\u00a0\nskin care or makeup could do it M: I feel like in the skincare community we\u00a0\ntalk so much about acne but nowhere near as\u00a0\u00a0 much about rosacea so if any of this is\u00a0\nsounding familiar then you might want\u00a0\u00a0 to read up a bit on rosacea and\u00a0\nconsider getting it checked out I'll put some more resources in the\u00a0\ncaption and keep in mind that if you\u00a0\u00a0 have darker skin the redness will be harder to see I hope you enjoyed this nerdy chat if you did like the video to train the YouTube\u00a0\nalgorithm to give you more content like this also share any tips you have and leave\u00a0\nquestions for Hannah in the comments you can follow Hannah here she's also\u00a0\nwritten a great book and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 how much I'm getting out of it from all of my tabs I also have an ebook on skincare and I hope\u00a0\nthis video helps your skin be less grumpy at you",

        "transcript": "if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you're probably having a hard time coming with a skincare regimen or finding skincare products that are effective for you well today in this video we're going to discuss rosacea and I'm going to give you over-the-counter skincare that can help stay tuned till the end because I will make a skincare regimen for your rosacea skin type with actual product recommendations so my name is Dr Swati Canon and I'm a board certified dermatologist out here in California thank you so much for watching this video and welcome to my channel what is rosacea rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness flushing sometimes pimple like bumps on your cheeks your nose your chin as well as textural changes of the nose chin and forehead even various triggers can flare or worsen rosacea and some of these common triggers include alcohol spicy foods sun exposure even stress and I know stress can worsen really anything but stress definitely can worsen rosacea as well as certain histamine-rich foods like tomatoes avocados certain skincare products can also rest in rosacea so there are a lot of triggers for rosacea and a lot of people don't really know what their triggers are so I recommend sometimes keeping a diary so you can know like hey I had red wine and now I have redness and flushing and all the rosacea symptoms or I had an avocado toast yesterday and now my rosacea is worse so keeping a diary can help with noticing what your triggers are but you know it is annoying to keep a diary so I get it rosacea can also affect really any ethnicity and any gender but it is more common in middle-aged Caucasian men and women unfortunately rosacea is chronic like a lot of our inflammatory conditions and there is no cure there are different types of rosacea so we have categorized them into different subsets the first type is called erythamato telangiotatic rosacea I know I don't know why dermatologists have such long words but this type of rosacea is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels or dilated blood vessels on the skin the second type is called Popular are popular postular rosacea and this is when you get pimple like bumps kind of in the middle of your face often acne and popular puscular rosacea can go together so they can be seen together the third type is called fiberous rosacea and this is when you get a thickening of skin or like a bulbous appearance on your nose and finally there's also ocular rosacea this is rosacea affecting the eyes causing redness tearing itching and sometimes vision problems now these categories are actually kind of fluid and changing there is an overlap between all of these categories so you can have you know erythematode rosacea and popular puscular rosacea so there's a lot of overlap but it just kind of helps to Define and gives us guidelines for treatment this video is going to focus on redness and the pimple form of rosacea and how to calm down the Baseline inflammation in rosacea patients thymus and ocular rosacea there is not really any over-the-counter treatment that helps for that so those require prescription or in-office treatments what are the best in ingredients for rosacea the main thing for rosacea patients is to use anti-inflammatory and hydrating ingredients goal is to have a simple yet effective skin care regimen that decreases the inflammation and doesn't cause irritation so you don't want to overuse skin care products the first ingredient for rosacea that I really love is azolic acid we've talked about azelaic acid a lot on my channel and even in my previous video that gave you ingredients for discoloration as a lake acid is one of them so it is one of the best ingredients for acne for rosacea for skin lightening it is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial meaning that it decreases some of the bacteria that play a role in rosacea over the counter you can find 10 azelic acid and we also give prescription strength which is 15 or 20 percent acetylic acid it's best to use acelic acid at night time most rosacea patients are not going to be able to tolerate a retinoid so you're going to use azelic acid instead the next ingredient for rosacea patients is niacinamide and this is a form of vitamin B3 and again I have talked about it a lot nice and mind is in a lot of skincare products especially in moisturizers it's helpful for redness it is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for hydration it also regulates oil production it reduces the appearance of pores so it's really an overall great ingredient for rosacea patients who also have probably all these other issues I don't recommend using niacinamide above five percent I recommend staying under five percent so notorium has a five percent niacinamide gel that you can try also a lot of moisturizers sunscreens they do have niacinamide so you don't have to use niacinamide separately I actually recommend using niacinamide in a moisturizer or in a sunscreen versus by itself tranexamic acid is the other ingredient for rosacea I definitely have it in my previous video where I talk about how helpful it is for hyperpigmentation and melasma it is also so helpful for rosacea because we now know that txa regulates blood vessel formation excessive blood vessel formation and dilation of blood vessels is what causes the redness and the flushing in rosacea patients and so when we can regulate it we can really minimize the appearance of redness txa is also very gentle so it is very well tolerated by most rosacea patients the one that I like is the notorium tranexamic acid serum this contains five percent tranexamic acid and niacinamide plus kojic acid it's helpful for lightning and for rosacea the next ingredient for rosacea is sodium sulfacedamide plus sulfur so sodium sulfacetamide is an anti-inflammatory skincare ingredient but this is often a prescription and it's really hard to find it over the counter however you can find sulfur soaps over the counter and sulfur is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial and that's kind of how it helps rosacea it is incredibly stinky sulfur smells like rotten eggs so some people just can't tolerate the smell of it but sulfur also helps with acne it helps with dandruff called cyborg dermatitis there's a lot of uses for this ingredient so just to clear up any confusion the first ingredient I talked about was sodium sulfacetamide and this can come as a face wash but it's hard to find it over the counter it's usually a prescription we combine sodium sulfacinamide with sulfur and that combination is very good for rosacea but you can also just find sulfur alone as a soap and this is what's usually found over the counter and sulfur alone has some of these properties that I just talked about the next ingredient for rosacea is using ceramides so ceramides are emollients that I've spoken about in the moisturizer video before and ceramides repair the Skin Barrier and they help to hydrate the skin so for rosacea patients it's incredibly important to maintain your skin barrier to protect that Skin Barrier so that you don't get too much irritation I like products like Ulta MD or CeraVe that make moisturizers and sunscreen with ceramides and niacinamide glycerin is another really great humectant for rosacea patients because glycerin is such a powerful hydrating ingredient so it really draws in that water to help moisturize your skin the next ingredient for rosacea is called acetyl tetrapeptide 40. so remember in my peptide video and I don't know if you guys watched it if you haven't watched watch my peptide video please go check it out but in my peptide video I talked about certain peptides that are anti-inflammatory an acetyl Tetra peptide 40 is an anti-inflammatory peptide that can be very helpful for rosacea it helps to reduce inflammation as well as redness it also helps to maintain the Skin Barrier and to protect the Skin Barrier function there are also other peptides that can be anti-inflammatory in fact Paula's Choice peptide booster has multiple peptides several of which are anti-inflammatory and can be very helpful for redness and rosacea patients by the way if you're enjoying and learning from this video please hit the Thumbs Up Button And subscribe to my channel and please also share this video with others who would find it helpful I am trying to grow my channel in 2023 so I am very grateful to all of you who are watching commenting and interacting with my content another really great rosacea ingredient is called and I'm gonna butcher this Camila Camila sinensis anyway this is green tea leaf extract so green tea leaf extract is really helpful for rosacea green tea as we know is very anti-inflammatory it's a very powerful antioxidant and it is used in skincare sometimes especially for rosacea skin another ingredient that I'm going to butcher is called Santa Nella asiatica definitely can't pronounce that but we're going to continue so Santa Nella asiatica in India we actually have this ingredient as well but we call it go to kala and it has many many benefits I actually remember taking gotu kala when I was little for colds it is a powerful antioxidant it is anti-inflammatory and it also helps a lot for inflammation with rosacea patients so it has become a lot more popular in America and it's become a lot more popular in skincare recently in the last few years so beauty of joseon is a Korean skincare brand that actually has a serum that contains a green tea leaf extract Centinela asiatica and vitamin B5 so it's very calming it's hydrating and it's also fragrance free so for rosacea patients that's like a winner have you guys tried Korean skincare products and Korean sunscreens if so please let me know and comment below I really love how Koreans approach skincare with their hydrating and calming ingredients so I think I'm definitely gonna make a YouTube video about it soon but let me know what Korean skincare products you have tried so that I can also look into them Dr jart psychopair tiger grass serum tiger grass or pear serum this has Centinela asiatica and niacinamide it also has like a greenish tint so you can use it in the morning because the green tip helps to cover redness and then it's anti-inflammatory for the actual rosacea component Dr jart sick a pear stick a player is it sick of pear or a single player crap sometimes like I cannot remember these names but this particular line of product also has a moisturizer with similar ingredients that is very common for rosacea patients so you can either use it in a serum or as a moisturizer burrito Centinela green level safe SPF 50 p8 plus plus this isn't a really great sunscreen by the way for rosacea and acne important patients because it contains Centinela asiatica niacinamide vitamin E is an SPF 50. so I really do like this sunscreen fertilization patients and if you've tried it let me know the other sunscreens I normally like for rosacea patients I tend to like sunscreens with zinc oxide so which is a physical sunscreen and I like physical sunscreens over chemical sunscreens because sometimes chemical sunscreens can worsen or trigger rosacea but there are certain chemical sunscreen formulations that are okay that are more well tolerated and one of them is the Ulta MD UV clear and I recommend this for a lot of different patients but it's a really great sunscreen with SPF 46 it contains niacinamide and it's very well tolerated a La Roche Posay also makes various sunscreens for rosacea patients and these are also pretty well tolerated so not all chemical sunscreens are going to flare your rosacea in general I do prefer physical sunscreens but some chemical formulations are okay by the way let's clear up differences between sensitive skin rosacea and having allergies or rashes to certain skin care products so some sensitive skin that's a broad category of patients that just means that you can't tolerate skin care more readily this includes your rosacea patients but you can also have sensitive skin without having rosacea sensitive skin means you're more likely to get rashes or irritation or acne more easily so it's really a broad category that includes various skin types rosacea is what I just said earlier where you have dilated blood vessels and can be characterized by flushing or pimple like bumps this is different than people who get an allergic or contact dermatitis or a rash from exposure to certain ingredients and skin care products or to even certain metals or to other types of preservatives so the most common example of contact dermatitis is nickel dermatitis and dermatitis by the way just means inflammation of the skin so that's a very non-specific term but nickel dermatitis you might have seen this is when patients or when people get a rash around their belly button because of coming into contact with the nickel and the button and the pants or the jeans so if you you tend to get contact dermatitis a common way to test for this at home is you can apply skincare product on your forearm for one to six weeks and see if you get any rashes or irritation if not you can then try the product on your face now this by the way this test the forearm test doesn't work for rosacea patients so rosacea patients it's very hard to see for skincare products can help you or harm you until you try but for rosacea patients what you can do is just try on the side of your face and see if you if you get a flare what are my ingredients to avoid in rosacea skin salicylic acid is one ingredient to avoid even if you have acne and rosacea so I know we commonly use salicylic acid for acne it is anti-inflammatory but it is also so irritating that we don't really recommend it for rosacea patients and this is a similar concept for benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide also is anti-inflammatory we also use it for acne but I don't always recommend it for rosacea patients because they can be irritating perhaps in low percentages it would be okay we just have other ingredients that we can use so we don't have to use these and this is the same for glycolic acid which is a type of chemical exfoliating acid because it's irritating or it can be irritating I also don't recommend it for rosacea now on the flip side polyhydroxy acids which are like a newer type of exfoliating acid they can be helpful for rosacea because they are less irritating they are more gentle and they can be anti-inflammatory so some rosacea patients can try polyhydroxy acids by the way not everyone needs to exfoliate so your skin naturally exfoliates on its own you don't have to use a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid or polyhydroxy acid to help exfoliate so don't feel the need to do so other ingredients like witch hazel Menthol camphor those all cause tingling that doesn't mean by the way it's working but they're all kind of these tingling irritating ingredients and I don't recommend them for rosacea other astringents or toners that contain alcohol or heavy content of alcohol definitely avoid this if you have rosacea because it can be so drying on the other hand though rose water toner can be helpful because rose water is coming and I actually made this video it talks about at home remedies for skin hair and nails if you're interested you can definitely go check it out fragrance if you see that on the label that could potentially also be irritating for rosacea so I would be mindful about it but by the way when you're looking at fragrance and alcohol you know you have to also see where it is on the ingredient list so if alcohol is like the sixth or seventh ingredient in the ingredient list it's probably gonna be okay and it's not going to dehydrate your skin that much but if it's in the top three ingredients then that means that that skin care product has too much alcohol and could potentially dehydrate your skin so retinoids I mean they are really an anti-aging Powerhouse but they can definitely trigger and flare rosacea so you do have to be careful I don't think retinoids are completely off limits for rosacea patients it really depends on how severe your rosacea is and what your triggers for rosacea are you know you just want to be careful so if you're going to want to use retinoids and you have rosacea you want to start very gentle gentle retinoids and then slowly increase their use as tolerated so to learn how to incorporate retinoids you can actually watch one of my first YouTube videos ever on retinoids and it really kind of teaches you how to incorporate a retinoid slowly into your skincare regimen some good options for retinoids in rosacea patients include this Keels Retinol Serum it's ceramides and peptides so this one contains retinol which is a gentler former for retinoid also and it contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides and peptides so start this one slowly but it is a good option for rosacea patients of course if you see an irritation or you see flaring of your rosacea stop any of these skincare products immediately the other good one for rosacea patients is the ordinary Grand active retinol Emulsion brand active retinol is a much gentler type of retinoid so it's really great for rosacea and sensitive skin types and this one also contains squalene invisible law which are ingredients that help with inflammation and hydration and it doesn't contain the shark squalene but the vegan version of squalene now how would you combine all of these ingredients for a skincare regimen in the morning you can use a gentle cleanser so you can actually use the sulfur wash or a prescription sodium sulfacetamide wash like I talked about earlier or you can just use a gentle cleanser like the La Roche Posay tolerain hydrating gentle cleanser or CeraVe gentle cleanser after you clean your face you can use one of the green tea serums like the beauty of joseon green tea serum or the Dr jarts like a pear serum followed by a moisturizer and then sunscreen on top so your moisturizer recommendations include like the Dr jarts like a pear moisturizer or a banana cream moisturizer or a CeraVe moisturizer really anything that's gentle and contains ceramides is a good moisturizer for rosacea patients and you would then follow this up by a sunscreen like the Alta MD UV clear sunscreen which also contains ceramides and niacinamide at night time you can again clean your your face and make sure you use a gentle cleanser to wash off even the makeup of your face you can then use a gentle retinoid like the Kiehl's Retinol Serum or you can use acelaic acid at night time so if you're going to use salicylic acid you can actually use it every single night as long as you don't get irritation but if you want to start a retinoid then you can use a retinoid twice a week and use azelic acid on the other night you would then follow this up with a moisturizer as well and some good moisturizer for rosacea patients include Ulta mdpm therapy or that Dr jart sickle player moisturizer that I talked about earlier on a side note if you do wear makeup and heavily tinted sunscreens and you have rosacea I still recommend that you double cleanse so you can watch this video on double cleansing to learn how to do it well for rosacea patients I don't want you to use any cleansers that strip the moisture off your face so to remove the makeup I recommend the cleansing bombs like the pharmacy Green Clean cleansing balm which is very hydrating and then you would follow the cleansing balm with a gentle cleanser an alternate skin care regimen would be this so in the morning you would cleanse like I talked about above you can then use a vitamin C serum and we'll talk about that soon followed by a moisturizer and then Alta you know the Alta MD sunscreen at night time again you can double cleanse use your azelaic acid and then a niacinamide moisturizer so as you notice I did mention vitamin C even if you have rosacea and vitamin C can really help with rosacea because it is anti-inflammatory and so it can help with some of the flares that rosacea patients have however certain forms of vitamin C and high concentrations of vitamin C can also flare rosacea so if you want to learn how to use vitamin C and you have rosacea make sure to check out this video that I have on vitamin C where I give vitamin C recommendations for rosacea patients and you can learn how to use it in your skincare regimen so thank you so much for

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "the three best products from the ordinary for rosacea prone skin if you do have rosacea it can be very difficult to find products that work well rosacea naturally is much more sensitive than even dry skin or sensitive skin and there's a lot of different things that can trigger rosacea such as eating spicy foods drinking alcohol or even going out into the Sun rosacea is primarily a vascular condition meaning the little blood capillaries that are naturally in your face are at the root cause for why this flares up for some people and although it's normally this redness in the cheeks rosacea can have pimples it's not the same thing as acne but they can look like acne and it is possible to have both rosacea and acne together these are the three best products from an ingredient perspective that should be okay for rosacea prone skin and that have the actives that have the potential to help and the first one actually mimics what dermatologists prescribe this is the salic acid ten percent in silicone and as a liqu acid is a really cool ingredient you may be familiar with other skincare acids however this one is much more gentle and for rosacea prone skin it can help dermatologists actually prescribe a 15-percent as they like acid solution for some patients with rosacea you can't get that over the counter it's too high of a percentage to get without prescription but this is at 10% and you can find other solutions that have 5% etc this helps with the redness of rosacea but it also helps if you do get those little white pustules those pimple like looking things and azalea kasih does also help with acne in case you have both as the oleic acid can burn a little bit when being put on the skin so do be aware of that but it is one of the ingredients that once the skin builds up tolerance to it can actually help to protect your skin a little bit more over the long run meaning that rosacea prone skin is less likely to flare up from other ingredients being used somewhere down the line because this is an a dimethicone base it's really nice and smooth onto the skin kind of like a primer the only things that it can ball up if you go at it too aggressively so I would recommend starting by patting it on the other thing is that as a liqu acid can be used day and night no problem dr. Sam is a dermatologist that I love and admire and she has used azalea Cassatt on pregnant and nursing patients for those who are pregnant earners it's hard to find skincare that is safe for both you and your baby so it's nice that this is an option and the other thing is that it's fairly unreactive so it's generally okay to use with most other things in a routine because of its silicone base it does work best after your serums either as a step before your moisturizers are kind of in place of your moisturizer or before your sunscreen since it has that silicone butt next you do have to consider sunscreen yes sunscreen can be used to help combat rosacea and the reason why is because the Sun is one of the major flares we see rosacea being vascular can be triggered by a lot of things but most people who suffer from it say that sun exposure is a big one sunscreen and the prevention of the UV rays from damaging those delicate little capillaries inside of the skin is really important not only to prevent it from flaring but to actually keep it under control and down regulate the steps that are already happening in your skin this is a mineral sunscreen from the ordinary I really love this one a lot of people have sensitivities to some of the chemical ingredients in sunscreen a lot of those are things like a boban zone oxybenzone octinoxate Homo say late those are not necessarily bad things however for people with sensitive skin they can be stinging they can be irritating and especially for people with rosacea prone skin the skin is already hypersensitive so you don't want to offend it more this sunscreen is an SPF 30 it's a great option that you could put on in the morning and the other thing is that it does have some other ingredients in here such as urea and such as Alan toen we've spoken about these ingredients before on this channel but as a little reminder these are both very soothing to the skin specifically urea can be helpful and Alan toen has been known to be anti-inflammatory which if you're having a rosacea flare-up would be very useful because we're talking about redness you know that this includes a recommendation for the niacinamide and zinc 10% this is really one of the best solutions that the ordinary has when it comes to large pores oiliness and redness and seeing as rosacea is this redness condition this vascular condition this is a really great place to start niacin amide otherwise known as b3 is a water-soluble vitamin and it really can do amazing things for the skin in combination with the zinc it helps to not only stabilize this but really target the areas of the skin that are experiencing that redness it take a little bit of time and some people have noticed that their skin kind of purges which means it gets a little bit worse before it gets better on initial application of this but especially for those who are struggling from rosacea that has the little white pustules or if you have rosacea and acne in combination this can help to down-regulate your skin's natural oil production so bye-bye grease that could be contributing to some of that and on top of that down regulate the redness that is normally associated with those flushes and those flares total transparency if your rosacea is really bad none of these products are gonna work once you get past kind of a critical point you really do have to go see a dermatologist and get a prescription or make sure it is rosacea and it's not acne in disguise there are also other types of redness in the skin such as erythema that are different than rosacea and need to be approached differently but lucky for you we have a whole bunch of guides on how to use the ordinary products as well as deep dives into basic ingredients and different skin conditions so that you can understand how to be a conscious consumer how to turn and learn your ingredient labels figure out what's in there and work with your healthcare team in order to treat and overall embrace and understand your skin if you learn something here make sure that you that like button and don't forget to brush that's subscribe button if you haven't already more videos can be found right here and I cannot wait to see you beautiful bunch of lies in the next video love you guys bye",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "rosacea is a condition i commonly see in clinics so in this video we're going to talk about what is rosacea how to best treat it and i'm going to offer some of my skincare tips for those of you who suffer from rosacea hi my name is dr jenny liu i'm a board certified dermatologist in minneapolis and welcome to my youtube channel so what is rosacea rosaceae is a chronic and inflammatory skin condition often characterized by skin sensitivity along with a tendency to flush and look rosy and red but also may develop pimple like bumps especially along the central face so the cheeks the nose the chin and the forehead and that is a very big definition of rosacea because we know that rosacea have various different presentations in fact we even used to categorize rosacea into four subtypes we still do for more academic purposes but for when we are seeing a patient in clinic we don't use those subcategories to really treat the patient we treat based on the clinical findings and the symptoms because we know for most individuals with rosacea they'll often have kind of a collection of various different subtypes number one is called erythrometal tylangitatic and that is the redness the flushing that we often see like the cheeks the nose the chin sometimes it can be very severe and large broken visible blood vessels can be present sometimes awareness often will flare with certain triggers and those triggers are different for everyone but common things would be heat wind cold spicy food stress chocolate caffeine all the good stuff subtype two is papular pustular rosacea so this is more than kind of what they used to call adult acne even though it's not truly acne but often gets misdiagnosed or mistaken for acne will present it is these pink zit or pimple like bumps and sometimes even pustules often on the nose the cheeks and the chin the third time is called phymatis and this has to do with chronic inflammation and over growth of your oil glands essentially often will present as more like a bulbous skin bulbous nose and that's called rhinophyma with uneven surface and texture with dilated pore like appearance but that feminist change can also be seen of the forehead as well as the chin and lastly the fourth subtype of rosacea is ocular rosacea and yes you can definitely get rosacea in your eyes often these patients will have like a dry and gritty like sensation grading the sensation in the eye sometimes eyelid margins can get crusty they can get styes and the whiteness of their eye can look more red and injected as i mentioned earlier most individuals will have a spectrum of these conditions and well being having the type 1 and type 2 so the flushing the redness along with pimples being the most common presentation that we see so why does rosacea happen you know unfortunately we are still trying to elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea so we don't completely understand it however we do know that it is very common affects 60 million americans and we often see it in like in the late 20s and 30s not so much in their kids and teenagers tends to present in adulthood now genetics do play a role in rosacea we tend to see this running in families as far as what is happening underneath the skin we do know that there are certain things that we see in rosacea patients that we don't see in individuals who don't have rosacea so number one there is a defective skin barrier and that could be a reason why often rosacea patients will complain that their skin is more sensitive either to products or to the environmental triggers there is increased interest epidermal water loss so the inability of the skin to hold on to water and tend to be more dry flaky and dehydrated we also know that there is actually a decreased amount of lipid production of the stratum corneum in rosacea patients similar there tends to be a an immunogenic so pro-inflammatory response for some reason and the inflammation will generate a cascade of reactions leading to production of enzymes that will generate inflammation but also can degrade collagen and we think that inflammation in part is what's responsible for the redness and those pimples that we see in rosacea patients furthermore there is what we call a neurogenic dysregulation so hypersensitivity along with again that clinical presentation that we see of being more sensitive to certain triggers and lastly there tends to be a hyper reaction to an organism that lives in the oil glands so there is a mite called demodex mite that we see in six percent of the normal healthy population there are these little bugs that you can actually even scrape out of the skin and put on a slide and clinic sometimes we'll do this and you can see these little prolly little critters and it's like i can't believe this just came out of my skin but in rosacea patients we found that there tends to be a higher density but not only is it the presence of these mites but we think in abnormal response to these mites is what is associated with the more popular and postular variant of rosacea now as mentioned earlier there can be common triggers for individual rosacea but one of the biggest risk factors is ultraviolet radiation we know that uv radiation is pro-inflammatory damages dna generates inflammatory response reactive estrogen cdc's and also upregulates all these inflammatory cytokines that already are pre-existing in rosacea patients that will often make that worse which is why it is super important to be doing thorough and diligent sun protection on a regular basis furthermore we know that in individuals who are more red and have dilated and broken blood vessels the sun often will make that worse so how we treat rosacea really depends on the presentation so if it's redness often lasers avoiding triggers certain prescription topicals can be helpful at temporarily reducing the amount of redness and obviously camouflaging is helpful when it comes to the papules or the pustules acne like bumps often prescription topicals and sometimes even oral medications are necessary for really severe cases i mentioned earlier oral antibiotics and sometimes even oral retinoids are used for severe cases but those overgrowth of sebaceous glands laser and certain type of procedures can be helpful next i'm going to offer some tips for general skin care and some of my personal favorite skin care products that i recommend for my rosacea patients the most important thing is if you do have rosacea is to see your dermatologist because like i said often prescription medications are really going to be helpful to help your rosacea get under control but nevertheless proper skincare is still going to be really really important and really the foundation as always you want to test out any products before using them and when it comes to skincare gentle is the way to go and less is more i recommend just a good gentle cleanser once or twice a day from cerave their hydrating cleanser vana cream facial cleanser is another really good one just find one that is going to be effective but not over strip your skin's natural oil now moisturizers are really going to be the key at helping to hydrate moisturize prevent trans epidermal water loss and really help to repair your skin barrier one of my favorite products is the one from cetaphil their redness relief night moisturizer this is very calming and soothing it contains ceramides niacinamide and shea butter and it's just a really good moisturizer and this is one of you that i have found that when my skin is like say recovering from a chemical peel and tends to be more sensitive it will not burn and has never burned my skin similarly another one that i personally love and use all the time is the two layering ultra moisturizing cream from la roche posay this is a thicker moisturizer contains glycerin thermal spring water shea butter and the neurosensing which is a peptide that they've actually done clinical studies on using this product on rosacea patients and has been found to have an anti-inflammatory and calming effects so this is one that i also really love one more moisturizer that i like especially to spot trace certain really irritated areas is the event sickle fades restorative cream and this is a zinc based zinc is really helpful for repairing skin it's used a lot in healing this is definitely kind of more white and pasty thick enough to even use on chapped lips if you need again something that can be really helpful soothing to the skin pretty thick so probably would use as needed to spot treat definitely can use it all over your face but i find that to be too a little bit too sick and heavy been occlusive and for those who want a lighter moisturizer either to use in the morning or if you have more oily skin the two that i've always recommended to my patients are one from cerave their pm facial moisturizer this is great i mean it says pm but it's lightweight it's oil free great to use under sunscreen in the morning in fact i do that sometimes as well as the laura's procedure and double facial moisturizer both of these are really helpful they're both oil free fast absorbing both contain ceramides and nice cinnamon that's gonna be helping to repair skin barrier and soothing so it's really just like a toss up i honestly love both and kind of will rotate through both of them depending on my mood now one last product that i have really been liking when my skin is just super sensitive is using an overnight sleeping mask one that i found to be really soothing and calming is the one from skin fix the redness relief overnight sleeping mask and this contains honey peptides and other calming ingredients and you wear it like a sleeping mask so you would wear it over your moisturizer and you will sleep in that it really helps to hydrate the skin repair the skin barrier and it's just very soothing and it really feels really good when you put it on your skin and it's kind of formulated for those with more sensitive red and rosacea prone skin so i would love to know if you've tried this please comment below and let me know what you think now i cannot finish off a rosacea video without talking and stressing the importance of wearing sunscreen i've talked about various types of my favorite sunscreens in my previous video and i will link some of my favorites that i think are well suited for rosacea prone skin down below in the description box but sunscreen is one of those no products that the best one is the one that you like enough that works well for your skin that you will remember and want to wear on a daily basis in general rosacea patients tend to tolerate mineral based sunscreen a little bit better just because often with this chemical sunscreen it can be more irritating and can burn but i have found a handful of mario's tissue patients including my skin that tends to be sensitive can tolerate certain types of chemical sunscreens it really all depends on the formulation here is where you have to try you want to make sure you're putting on enough most people under apply so at least a teaspoon for your head and neck reapply it throughout the day and this is really important because we do know that ultraviolet radiation come through windows and most of us because we under apply and your sunscreen gets rubbed off throughout the day that is going to make a huge difference when it comes to protecting your skin so really make sure that you are reapplying using the proper amount so those are some of my favorite skincare recommendations i hope you guys found this video helpful and let me know if you have rosacea if you have tried any of these products that i've recommended i'd love to hear what you think about them similarly if you have a holy grail product that i did not mention today comment below because i would love to try them out myself and hopefully recommend them to my patients as well if you enjoy watching this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel again you can follow me on my various social media accounts until next time thanks

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare product recommendations for persistent facial redness I know it's really frustrating to deal with I really hope this video was informative to you guys everything I mentioned will be linked in the description box if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "hey guys I'm dr. Mona GU Hara and welcome back to another episode of dear derm today we're going to talk all about rosacea [Music] so rest assured that I see rosacea patients every single day it is super super common so you are not alone but sometimes you may not think it's rosacea and patients come in and they say doctor Kihara I really sensitive skin when actually that's not what's going on but that doesn't mean we're not going to talk about it today I'm deer derm we're gonna dig in a little bit deeper and talk about the different kinds of rosacea and what skincare routine would be optimal for you if you think you have it [Music] rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that a lot of people associate with redness on the face but it can actually present itself in many different ways so let's get into that a little bit more so there's four different things that I kind of talk about my patience with and people can have any variation of that first trigger-based flushing so hotter spicy food red wine changes of emotion changes of temperature I hate to use the word both hormonal flushing and the face gets a little bit pink in the cheeks and then the flushing goes back down second is textural changes on the skin so acne bumps enlarged pores dryness easily irritated any of those things where the texture of your skin is noticeably different may actually be a component of rosacea and what's interesting is you actually may see these textural changes which kind of look like pimples around your chin nose and eyes third you may see broken capillaries little tiny broken blood vessels in the skin that actually leave the skin looking a little bit pink and red and somebody may think for example you've been sunburned or have a little blush on when actually you don't and then lastly ocular rosacea or rosacea around the eye that leaves the eye watery feeling a little bit gritty like you want to dig something out of there each one of these components of rosacea has a nuance treatment that your dermatologist may talk to you about that being said anyone with rosacea really should consider using a very gentle skin care routine on a daily basis [Music] when I talk to patients about what they should be using on their face in the context of rosacea the first would start with a very gentle hydrating cleanser no harsh soaps nothing that's foaming nothing that's drying because what that's gonna do is it's just gonna stoke the fire creating more redness second when it comes to exfoliation I recommend using a beta hydroxy acid like salicylic acid instead of an alpha hydroxy acid like glycolic acid why because it's a little less irritating and also it can help minimize the enlarged pores which often come along with the textural changes of rosacea moisturization is essential because patients with rosacea may note that they have particularly dry skin so I recommend looking for creams and lotions that have components like ceramides glycerin and hyaluronic acid lastly and probably most importantly is sun protection and ultraviolet protection because we know that UV light and heat can be a very big trigger for rosacea flares so I recommend to my patients that they never leave the house before applying a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher if you're interested in collagen building or fading down fine lines here are some of the ingredients that I like the Cuchillo is a plant-based ingredient that's been used in many other parts of the world to bring out radiance and glow and increase collagen production and it's extremely gentle on the skin also I really like a vitamin a derivative called ret and aldehyde which helps to build collagen but is a lot less inflammatory than other retinoids [Music] so here are some of the things that I recommend avoiding when you're applying makeup I wouldn't use the harsh bristly brushes this is a great place for the makeup sponge to blend in your foundation or to put on your concealer because they're a lot less irritating to the skin and may not bring out that redness that can be triggered by irritation on the skin I also recommend avoiding mechanical cleansing brushes and mechanical exfoliants because they can actually make you have more broken capillaries on the skin so I would just steer clear of those altogether and then the last thing I would say is just be overall very careful of what you're putting on the skin it kind of takes some examination before you buy a product just because it says natural or organic or plant-based doesn't mean it's great for the skin and it actually may be pro-inflammatory [Music] so here are some specific product lines that I like for rosacea for sunscreen I like the elta MD line they have a wonderful product called Alta clear that you can put on each morning before you leave the house and as the clear and the name connotes it blends in easily with any skin routine but it also has this little magic gem of niacinamide in it that helps to reduce inflammation so that's one of my fan favorites when it comes to rosacea products I also like this line called a vent which is in general which is very gentle on the skin for those of you interested in collagen production and decreasing fine line this product here which is active ingredient is retinaldehyde is a gem just use a pea-sized amount over the entire face to get your desired result now one of the tips and tricks I tell my patients is actually just to apply it to the periphery of the face not the central face because the outside of your face is where you'll have the least amount of inflammation from rosacea but most of those pesky little lines another product line I love which is from Spain is called isdon't you can find it locally here in the US and this in particular this line in particular called mell atonic is infused with the coochie all that plant-based derivative that we talked about and it's very gentle I really love this because it's a serum base and I can and I like that it's clear as you can see and I like that I could use it in the morning or at night giving me a little bit more flexibility in my routine so I actually use this on a regular basis because I myself had of a smidge of rosacea that's trigger based for my feet so when I get out of the shower my face is a little flushed and I just put on my mellow tonic [Music] now that you have the general skincare routine for rosacea let's talk about the specific treatments that I may recommend to my patients so first for trigger-based flushing and I know this is SuperDuper annoying what I usually recommend to avoid the triggers the second component of rosacea that we talked about which is the textural changes or the acne bumps that may occur around the mouth the nose or the eyes eye there are a lot of options for this there could be topical or oral antibiotics that can come in the form of creams or pills and those can significantly help to reduce those irritated inflamed papules that occur and many times that is what causes the most anxiety in cases of patients who have rosacea third for the broken capillaries on the face thank God for lasers because they really help to reduce and get rid of those little teeny-weeny capillaries that are creating the red and pink hue to the cheeks and lastly ocular rosacea which actually can be the trickiest one to treat and can come on and off for years your dermatologist may give you an oral antibiotic to subside some of the inflammation or even recommend gentle cleansers to place along the eyelid to get rid of some aback grit so I hope from this episode that you learned that there are different components to rosacea but also a lot of different treatment options so definitely get in to your dermatologist and definitely check out some of the products we recommended today thank you so much for watching this episode of dear derm don't forget to subscribe to well and good and leave any comments below you",

        "transcript": "Sonia yes you know what month it is right no what month is it it's National rosacea awareness month so it's really great for rosacea sensitive skin and I'm somebody who's really reactive with rosacea so when we're first talking about rosacea in general we're really looking at what in the skin we gotta talk about it well what would you use to treat rosacea okay first of all my Trio for rosacea is gonna be aloe and calendula coming Mist Chrono calm serum and then Rose ease relief cream um so these are going to be really awesome if you do suffer from rosacea these are going to help to treat the redness help to treat inflammation sensitivity in the skin and you can actually mix your Chrono bomb and your Alum calendula calming Mist to help make your product spread a little bit easier and last longer this wouldn't be too stimulating for rosacea or sensitive skin you know it's really great for rosacea sensitive skin um but again if you're looking at different grades of rosacea I mean there's a number of different subtypes there's four different subtypes of rosacea subtype 3 would probably be the top end that you see but within subtype 2 you have a pretty broad range of diffuse redness and what we would call Pop wheels and pustules in fact subtype two is called papillopuscular rosacea so you just have to be wary of how extreme that subtitude if it's at the very top end they may experience some discomfort but even water can be discomforting for clients that are experiencing that level of severity of rosacea as a solo it's always to find a brand that like like um and there and their products really do and I'm somebody who's really reactive with rosacea so it's hard to find a whole line and brand that you can use everything in and I've tried everything and I've never had any issues and everything works really well and they're professional treatments too um just are beyond amazing like after one you see a difference even just facial like it's superficial facial I see a difference with their products so it's they're amazing that's awesome so I made the right decision on that one personally just for me because I have rosacea it's going to be the Chrono calm and the Rosie's relief cream because those work maybe for my skin um but I'm in love with everything um but I think for my clients again because I deal with more like pigmentation issues um and anti-aging um definitely like the bright white serum they love um super lightweight but it really targets those pigment um and then I'd have to see the myocyte plus because everybody's looking for that like botox without Botox right so that one's amazing too so when we're first talking about rosacea in general we're really looking at what in the skin an inflammatory response due to an overpopulation of a little facial Mite that we all have and if you want to be fun and sciency the Demodex follicularum facial night which is the might we all have on our skin right which is probably something that we don't want to know but those who suffer from rosacea have a higher population of the Mite and more of a sensitivity to their byproducts when we look at somebody who's sensitive or who has a compromised barrier what are we looking at that's different than rosacea so with someone who is presenting with a compromised barrier we're not going to see the localized redness or erythema around the nose and cheeks we're going to see a systemic redness and typically pretty dry profile as well because they're unable to really retain a lot of that moisture so they have advanced rates of trans epidermal water loss we have two different cleanser options for rosacea would you recommend using these both AM and PM or would you recommend one for day and one for night that's such a great question because it can go either way for a client who has a little more disruption to their barrier you may start with vitamin Veil only until their barrier is a little bit healthier but if their barrier is pretty good and they just need a little management for those rosacea areas usually nose and cheek then you can do vitamin Veil following with lipid replacing cleansing gel in general though if the clientele is a little bit more mature they tend to love the vitamin Veil and the little veil of vitamins the emollient seed Left Behind which really helps to protect the skin but for younger clientele that may be struggling with rosacea they tend to like a little more of that clean I hate to say the word squeaky clean because we all know that's not not so good but lipid replacing cleansing gel will give them that really nice thorough cleansed feel without disrupting the barrier so you're not going to be making the problem worse yeah I think that's the biggest thing to note with both of the options for cleansers with circadia for rosacea both of them are going to keep the Integrity of the barrier in place and help to fortify it versus stripping it or breaking it down so both of these are going to be wonderful options I think it's really important to note that a lot of our rosacea clientele tend to be heavy makeup wearers because they're trying to cover that redness that they haven't been able to find a true solution for and so the vitamin Veil is going to really grip bond to that makeup oil dirt debris within the skin so we can remove it a big part of a rosacea client's problem is that they're typically not cleansing thoroughly enough because their skin doesn't usually feel good after so this is going to be a really beautiful solution for them the next step in both your am and your PM regimen is going to be the aloe and calendula calming Mist so this mist is one of my favorite products within the collection for sensitive and rosacea skin because it has the same Purity and potency as your traditional serums do but it's just in a really nice misting application so you can apply this more than twice a day really you can apply it multiple times throughout the day and it has really good healing calming hydrating properties to it and especially in the evening with your circadian rhythms you have an increase in heat in the evenings so using the aloe Mist to have that nice hydrating misting application is really good for you know what I love too A lot of times with rosacea clients their little cheekies get so warm and hot so if you pop your aloe and calendula Mist in the fridge chef's kiss yes just so calming refreshing with rosacea clients and the barrier being disrupted a lot of the vitamin C's that are currently on the market are formulated with a pH that's a little too low and that can cause surface redness irritation stinging sensation and for those whose barrier are very compromised it's going to result in even a little topical chemical burn and so with our vitamin C it's in a hyaluronic acid base so it's going to be very hydrating and we utilize magnesium a scorable phosphate so this is a very very stable form of vitamin C it'll never oxidize and the Beautiful part is because of that magnesium and that phosphate and the hyaluronic acid base it raises the pH to be a very neutral right about seven which is the same pH as water so this is going to be incredibly tolerable for your clientele while helping to really get the Integrity back into their skin I would say this is probably the number one product for rosacea so again as Chris mentioned you can see it's this really Crystal Clear consistency it won't ever oxidize and then it goes on really clear and it absorbs really nicely into the skin almost immediately so the other beautiful thing is the post peel balm I think is one of the most beautiful bases for makeup as well because it gives you that little bit of extra smoothing and as you can tell we are just having the best time here no pilling up no greasy especially if we're talking about sensitive or rosacea clientele with a disrupted barrier this is going to help to be almost their barrier until their own natural barrier is fully repaired agreed this is where all of those heavy hitter reduction in redness and calming agents and peptides and ingredients are are going to be in so you can take either one of these cleansers and you can use them in the evening as well and then again you're always going to want to use your aloe and calendula calming Mist multiple times a day but definitely am routine and PM routine so you'll cleanse with one of your either vitamin Veil cleanser or lipid replacing cleansing gel your aloe mist and then the Chrono calm I'll let Chris talk a little about Chrono calm because she says she has three favorite products but secretly I think this is like number one on your roster it switches it'll probably change as we talk about other restaurants but I do we are in a committed relationship chronocom and I this is such a beautiful beautiful product to really work on the inflammatory state of the skin and the way that it calms down redness and nourishes your natural immunity for your skin which is really your logger hunt cells so we have op beta glucan in here which is what the loggerhan cells feed off of it's what they need to eat and those cells are a dendritic cell down in the deeper layer of your skin and they're responsible for getting rid of environmental pollution bacteria infection so this is going to help to really restore the health and integrity to the skin from within and it's such a beautiful anti-redness agent as well whether you have rosacea and you have redness from that or whether you have redness from just disrupted barrier or doing something crazy you saw on Tick Tock or the internet um don't trust tick tock it happens so one the anti-redness ingredient in here that Chris is talking about it's a peptide called talangean and it's actually the number one anti-redness peptide on the market so you'll also see with this it is a little bit cloudier of a consistency than the micro or the vitamin C reversal serum but it does still have that same hyaluronic acid base so it's incredibly hydrating it has the amazing anti-redness peptide in here the oat beta glucan as you mentioned and Dr puglies is our founder and formulator and he was actually doing some some clinical work on beta glucan and he applied topical beta-glucan to the skin and he actually visibly saw the longer Han cells reaching up to grab the beta glucans so it's incredibly helpful and beneficial for the compromised skin and helping with the immune supports of course after they do their Chrono calm my other love of my let's see it's already happened my other love of my life Tranquility cream this is your bread and butter this is another one of your very powerful agents for rosacea and this is going to be your nourishing cream for night nice and creamy It Feels So comforting and a big piece of sensitive sensitized reactive and rosacea skin is there's so much discomfort and we have a beautiful ingredient in here called delicence did I say it right delicence delicence which helps to really calm down those sensitized receptors and calm down that pain response which is also great for the evening when some of those receptors are at their heights now the difference between your sensitive skin and a true subtype rosacea everything is really going to stay the same as far as your regimen we're just adding in one additional product and this is the Rosie's relief cream now Dr puglies again who is our amazing founder and formulator he was doing extensive research on the Demodex Mite that Chris had mentioned before and how we can decrease or eliminate the population so through his research he found a proprietary blend of different essential oils that was actually designed to asphyxiate this might so he took all of the research that he was doing and he put it into a lovely retail cream that can be applied as a treatment cream so this is going to help to decrease or eliminate the population of the mites so we can actually address the underlying inflammatory components of this particular skin condition this has a a strong Rosemary extract in it which you would think Rosemary can be slightly stimulating so that's why we only suggest to use this a couple of times a week to get started so you would want to apply it every other day making sure that your skin can adapt to it and it's going to be a PM application only and when we say PM application with this and Target treating you're gonna really be targeting those areas where you see those red flares and our traditional rosacea flares happening at and just as a fun fact that Demodex might feeds on oil which is why we tend to see these flares in the high oil production places around the nose the little cheeks and sometimes forehead or chin because those are our highest oil production areas I must say men fall in love with this cream I have some clients who's the woman has rosacea and uses this and the men just full force their whole face with it because it has such a nice almost woodsy scent to it and it's very refreshing my Heavy Hitters for rosacea is going to depend on what subtype you are if you're a subtype one which is your more mild you can get away with the Tranquility cream and chronocom and that's really what's going to handle your rosacea but anything other than a subtype one you really do need to add in the Rosie's relief cream for them because that's their true solution to mitigating those flares and for someone who's subtype one when they're stressed or when they're sick they may need Rosie's relief because whenever we're stressed or sick our immune system decreases and we see a boom in the population of these mites and I think one of the things to to notice too is the big point of differentiation between a subtype one and a subtype two is those papules and pustules so we know that you can really differentiate your lower subtypes of rosacea from your higher subtypes when you're seeing that through your skin analysis so that's when you know that it's really time to bring in the Heavy Hitters and really start to use the Rosie's relief cream at home absolutely we just had a core and she's beautiful and Brilliant but when we mentioned the demo Dax bug she didn't know who we're talking about and then you jumped right in so how does the Demodex bug affect rosacea skin and what are some of the signs and symptoms that it might be flaring up and when is it time to actually use these products great questions so when um we talk about the Diamondbacks might um really what's happening is that everyone has this Smite on their skin what's the difference between me you and a rosacea fine well that client is having a reaction to the byproduct or the debris of this might and so what we see is that they get a lot of inflammation some popular activity um just a lot of discomfort redness so what we see is that that is when we want to start incorporating these products to help with the redness help with the inflammation also help to control some of that oil production because that is why typically we see it in the T-Zone area um because the Demodex white loves to feed off of oil so yeah absolutely and these are all packed with essential oils Botanicals so it's not some people that have rosacea they're worried about harsh treatments or something causing irritation and these are so incredibly gentle that it also reduces redness but also creates an environment for for healing and anti-inflammatory so you can kind of get that healthy glow back without that irritation and redness",

        "description": "Azelaic acid has been a GAME CHANGER for my skin; supporting my rosacea, and inflammatory skin in a way that no other ...",
        "published_at": "2023-07-09T14:30:28Z",
        "transcript": "kind of feel like I'm the poster child for the benefits of azoleic acid it literally has done for my skin what no other skincare ingredient or product has done and that is keeping my rosacea and inflammatory skin at Bay just look at how my skin has struggled with rosacea over the years and look at it now I have been using over-the-counter azoleic acid skin care products for the last few years and I've already done videos on some of my favorite products so I'll link those at the end of this video and also in the description box below I'm not really going to go into that today what I'm going to do is answer the question I get repeatedly asked here on YouTube over on Tick Tock and Instagram and that is how do I layer azelaic acid effectively in my skincare routine so just a very brief overview of azoleic acid and its benefits to the skin if you're new to this particular ingredient azelic acid is a naturally occurring and skin identical ingredient just meaning that it is already present in our skin so known terosinase inhibitor which is responsible for producing melanin in the skin skin which gives color to our skin which is why as an ingredient azelic acid is great to Target hyperpigmentation issues and also melasma it also has exfoliating properties it is not an aha or an alpha hydroxy so it doesn't perform exactly the same as glycolic acid or lactic acid but it can help to smooth out your skin tone and even out your texture basically a gentle option that can even suit sensitive skin types but the greatest benefit for me has been its antimicrobial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties this is what makes it ideal for rosacea and acne prone skin helping to calm and soothe and reduce the inflammation Associated redness and pimples this is why I turned to this ingredient in the first place because I have struggled for years with the side effects of rosacea my skin is combination it's sensitive from rosacea prone it also tends to be dehydrated and when my rosacea flares It's My Skin Barrier that is very much impaired some of my triggers I know and recognize and others I don't even know what they are overdoing things in my skincare routine is definitely a trigger because if I compromise my barrier by using too many active ingredients all at once or things that are too strong for my skin will set my rosacea on fire drinking red wine I hate that one because I actually like drinking red wine and the Sun is one of my biggest triggers so I try to mitigate those wrists as best I can I wear a sunscreen I focus on my skincare routine and really focus on maintaining My Skin Barrier and I limit the amount of red wine that I drink the regular use of azelaic acid just simply cannot be understated for me when I put together my morning and evening skincare routine I just follow a very simple philosophy and that is maintain and prioritize My Skin Barrier at all costs so that means being flexible with my routines if my skin is in a compromised State I will adjust my skincare routines to be simply hydrating and really focus on that barrier repair but if my skin skin is in good health like it is right now in the morning I like to prioritize a vitamin C because I want the well-aging benefits associated with it and in the evening I sort of revolve my routines around the regular use of a retinoid using acid exfoliation limited just because of my skin and hydrating skin care so how does azoleic acid fit into all of that it's quite simple really let's start with the morning azoleic acid and vitamin C actually do pair very well together I say that but that is also with a bit of a caveat vitamin C is an ingredient that lots of people are irritated with that sounds like I'm saying oh vitamin C you're pissing me off today A lot of people are irritated by vitamin C that doesn't even sound any better A lot of people have irritation on their skin when they use vitamin C I think that makes sense but if you use vitamin C regularly and love to gain the benefits from it then pairing an azaleaic acid with that works really well try it on its own to see that you have no issues with the product and then try pairing them together if you're good you're good for my morning routine I like to cleanse with water only it just works really well to maintain My Skin Barrier rather than using a cleanser I reserve that for my evening routine we'll talk about that in a moment I also like to tone my skin after cleansing and that's because toners these days are just packed full of nice hydrating ingredients and then I wait for my skin to dry before I apply my vitamin C serum then I apply my azoleic acid and then I apply a moisturizer and then a sunscreen and that is my morning routine I tend to follow the philosophy of thinnest consistency of products to thickest consistency of products but I do make exceptions the azaleaic acid that I'm currently using is a prescription strength this is a 15 azaleaic acid it does have a creamy texture so in terms of texture it sort of sits well in my skincare routine at that point this is a 15 azaleaic acid most over-the-counter products are going to be under 15 and can range anywhere from three up to 10 percent is normally what I see just showing you the texture here it really sinks into the skin quite nicely but don't always believe that more equals more over-the-counter options have shown to be very efficacious as well even in a range from three to five percent I've seen lots of people say that azelic acid does better after some of your active ingredients in your skincare routine but if the azelaic acid you're using is a much thinner consistency you could put it earlier in your routine if you wish I don't really know that there is a true hard and fast rule on that but I've been doing it this way for a couple of years and it seems to be really working for my skin so there's your anecdotal evidence at least from me I love that vitamin C and azelic acid pair so well together because I can really combine all the well-aging benefits that I'm also trying to Target in my skin combined with what I need to support my rosacea azelic acid can have some side effects for some people including dryness and flaky skin some people find that it tingles or stings a bit upon application I haven't had that experience and perhaps it's because I did a slow introduction when I introduced it initially when I started using over-the-counter osceolaic acids I was only using it once per day in my skincare routine when I moved up to the prescription strength my doctor recommended that I use it twice in my skincare routine so both morning and evening that's particular to my needs so of course if you're using a prescription strength azolacic acid you'll be in consultation with your medical professional moving into my evening routines I'm just going to explain a few of the routines that I sprinkle throughout the week starting with a hydrating skincare routine I usually do a routine like this every other day that I'm not using a retinoid or an alpha hydroxy acid it gives my skin the chance to repair itself and I find it's a really good strategy for my rosacea skin and prioritizing my skin barrier as much as I want the benefits of well-aging products and retinoids in particular throughout the week in my skin skincare routine for me it just doesn't work so well that way because my skin will get easily compromised and then I'm back to square one let me know in the comments if you're able to use a retinoid every day or if you're kind of like me and have to balance it out with other routines just to be sure that you're not damaging Your Skin Barrier if I'm doing a simple hydrating skincare routine I would double cleanse my skin that's using an oil cleansing balm or a micellar water to remove all the dirt oil makeup sunscreen debris from my face followed up with a water-based cleanser again I would apply a toner to my damp skin after cleansing then I would follow up with my hydrating serum or serums I like to use face oils and then a moisturizer on the evenings that I use an alpha hydroxy acid I do not use a nasolic acid in the same routine Alpha hydroxy acids for me are already borderline irritating for my skin that routine I need to hold kind of sacred and be very very careful because overdoing it with an acid can easily set my rosacea on fire so when I do that skincare routine for me it's once a week and I get great results from doing it that way so I really don't need to do it every single day but I know some people like to and can double cleanse apply my toner apply my Alpha hydroxy to dry skin and then follow up with a face oil and moisturizer and that's it as for a BHA or a beta hydroxy acid I do the same thing I typically use a BHA on its own once per week and so I keep my azulaic acid out of that routine however when acelic acid is formulated with a BHA salicylic acid then it's no problem and this one is really great from Paula's choices they're 10 azoleic acid booster formulated together with salicylic acid a lot of the times people get hung up on what can and cannot be paired together when it's formulated together all of those things are taken into consideration it's when you're layering products yourself acting like a little cosmetic chemist in your bathroom which I love to do that is when you can be at risk or an increased risk of irritation because there's no formulation in there helping those two ingredients to work synergistically together and reducing the level of irritation but could you layer them together yes if your skin can tolerate it you can that's the beauty of azelic acid it fits in well with other skin care products very effectively for my retinoid night I have found no issue with layering azelic acid in my retinoid together I typically use a retinaldehyde and if you don't know what that is or anything about the retinoid family don't worry I've done a video explaining everything there is to know about retinoids because I was so confused when I first started using them I'll link that at the end of this video and in the description box below for you as well so for that routine I would double cleanse tone my skin apply my retinol to dry skin apply my osceolaic acid face oil and moisturizer I hope this video has helped you understand how I put together my skincare routines using azoleic acid and for me prioritizing it in both my evening and morning skincare routines be sure to drop your azelic acid questions comments and experiences in the comments section below if you haven't already watched these videos be sure to watch them next and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "published_at": "2015-12-17T16:12:51Z",
        "transcript": "[Music] hey guys it's Heidi welcome back to the Inside Out Beauty and in today's episode I wanted to share with you my skincare routine but we're not going to discuss any skincare products these are very specific to managing redness and the reason behind this is that I have the most ridiculously sensitive skin you will ever know so if you guys have um you know tendency to have retinas if you guys have rosacea or very very allergic skin then you will probably find my personal experience helpful um that said these dazen at all replace the professional guidance of a dermatologist so you guys if you have chronic redness and you're not sure the source uh then please do go ahead and visit your doctor because I'm clearly not one all right so let me just share with you the products and the brands that I'm currently using um and tell you kind of in what situations each of them is more helpful for [Music] me all right so in the morning the first thing I want to do is of course clean my skin but I don't need to clean it very very thoroughly because one I don't have oily skin my skin is rather dry or very very dry actually and of course I would have already cleaned it more thoroughly the night before when I removed my makeup I can use a very very gentle cleanser and for that I use the Evan sakom ad oilbased says here it's specific to calming ity skin also specific to very very dry skin to allergies as well so yeah it just says my name all over it's really really really really soft has a nice pump so it's really easy to apply theen line is famous for having thermal water and is also made in French if you have slightly more oily or combination skin then I would recommend the aan tree SRA it's a cleansing gel without soap and without perfume and it's also for very dry skin but I do find that it is more for a deeper cleansing and it can be just a tiny bit harsher to me this kind of irritates my skin a a little bit and I know it sounds ridiculous because this is you know specific for sensitive skin but I prefer this one because it's more for a very very dry skin like mine and it's more gentle and the tercera I think would be better for people who usually need more uh more thorough deeper cleansing if that makes sense The Next Step will most of the times depend on what I'm doing next like like if it is a weekend and I'm not going out straight away maybe I'm just you know chilling at home uh then I will go one way and then a weekday and I have to run errands where we go out to the sun then I will go another way so let's start with a typical weekday in which of course you have to get out of your house and expose your very sensitive skin to the Sun and really for just about any skin type you always want to be super protected and for that I use the aen anti- rouers uh moisturizing protective cream uh for jure that's for the day and it has of course SPF 20 um which of course will protect you from sunlight and stuff like that now I have to say every single product I've tried every single moisturizer I've tried for my face with SPF has in some way or another caused just a Teena bit of irritation I wouldn't use it if it did cause brightness like dramatic brightness for me but it's not I don't find it particularly soothing this product but you always always need to wear sunscreen because of your sensitivity as well so it's kind of a trade-off um I'm going to tell you in just one second what I do um to kind of overcome the fact that sunscreen in any form for me is really really irritating uh but I want to kind of rra up about this product like I said it's a moisturizing protecting cream with SPF 20 to for dry to very dry sensitive skin that's Pro prone to CER roses it basically hydrates and protects from the Sun and what I do is mix this with another product from the same line from the aan anti- rur line and this is the anti- rouers Fort this is a relief concentrate for chronic redness and basically what I do is I apply the day cream moisturizer with SPF first all over my face and then on this area on my cheeks that's the most and my nose that is the the area my sensitive area actually because I don't get retinas anywhere else uh I would apply anti- rouers for it and this you guys this is my top this is at the top of my list on things to repurchase I will for sure for sure always have this product at least until it stops working for me because I honestly put a little bit of this product on my cheeks and it it in a few seconds it will just calm it down just really really Soothe My Skin and and both of these are fine if you use them you know to prime your face just before foundation anytime in the day you have a flare or even if you don't have time to wear foundation and you see your red face and you go like I really don't want to go out looking like this then I always turn to this um anti-er Port that's really concentrate I put it on just I don't know a couple minutes before leaving and I will feel a lot more confident as my skin soups if it's my pamper evening or if I have got in a bit more time because I'm kind of prepping for an event or a dinner party or you know just because it's the weekend and I'm just chilling and I don't really have to be anywhere then I will use the Evan anti- rouers cm it's a retinus relief soothing Repair Mask has a different type of texture you basically put it on and leave it for 5 minutes and then when you you see that your your skin looks more like soothed and your your redness is gone then you just wash it off another thing that I find really helpful and this is actually this product is actually the reason I looked into event products in the first place and this brings me back to the beginning of the video remember my little advice over there to go to your dermatologist okay so this is what happened I started having a lot of redness more than normal and I went to my dermatologist and she said amongst other things like being allergic or you know having dermatitis and I don't know what else she said you have also a little bit of rosacea when you get those little like pimples um that are not acne they're just if you guys have ration you know what I'm talking about they're really really small ones and they they itch a little bit so when I went there she said of course those little pimples they kind of damage your skin you know a little bit because uh you know you're because of course they will eventually like break and you know it it it's just not good for your skin so what she prescribed me like literally because of then you guys should know it's not a Cosmetics company it's a pharmaceutical company so she actually prescribed uh Cal fate I hope I'm saying this correctly French products um so uh this is a repair cream for very sensitive and irritated skins and this is great now this cannot be worn in my experience it it's not good under your foundation but if you are like in the evening or if you're just chilling and or before going to bed at night and you really want to kind of help your skin heel these two the rers anti- rouers for and the CLE face are for sure for sure two that I will always repurchase even the water contains chlorine and other chemicals to kind of purify it at least in my country it does and that can be a little bit irritating for someone that's very sensitive like me so I did purchase the uh alal or the thermal water from a v as well has 300 mL of thermal water now I have I have to say I haven't found this particularly soothing um it's not like I put it on and I see a dramatic difference like I do see with these other two products I mentioned but um I do prefer because it doesn't irritate my skin as much as t water so uh I use it and also there's a few other things I use the thermal water for use for my beauty blender to get it slightly wet even to set my makeup I also uh use this sometimes so yeah I mean I like it I'm not 100% sure if I'm in a tight budget I will probably skip it Al together the next thing I want to show you and this is kind of can be kind of homemade this is a herbal lotion even better than the event thermal water I have to say I'm sorry but um in that in this particular product I think this one wings and you can you know prepare it at home you don't have to spend that much money at all this is a combination of camomile Ando oh my God I don't know how to say that in English let me search translate tilo to English huh lynon there thank you Google translate so this is a combination of Kile te and lynon you basically put this in your freezer and when you have a flare then I would just go ahead and just spray it all over and it's just a this very cooling super calming uh sensation the other thing I really really really really want to recommend is the beauty blender pure and this is the white Beauty blender I would recommend it for anyone but particularly anyone that has sensitive skin or uh tendency to ress you really don't want to Rob your skin while applying skin care this has a right bals it will also add a little water so that your skin care kind of um absorbs better so yeah it's definitely a great idea to have one of these you guys and also it's white so it's not going to get stained with your skincare it's also a color guide for you so that you don't get it mixed up with your other Beauty blenders I mean this is a great idea now back to daytime if I want to go out and I will not wear makeup whatsoever and I'm looking really really really red and I don't want it for some reason I I don't want to use you know the other event products the SPF one there is a really really good line that I've been using for a very long time from Clinique and that's the Clinique redness Solutions and this one is a daily protective base with SPF 15 and this one is really good I wish the SPF was a little bit higher like or 30 but what this has that the moisturizing protective cream from the event antier like doesn't have is a a very agreeing pigmentation kind of in the gray area between makeup and skincare but I would say is more of a skincare product so what I would do is a PL in my problem area it's green but it starts becoming like it starts blending in you're not going to look green it will give me more confidence to go out without makeup Solutions line is really really good but I find that it is particularly better when I'm having rosacea flares as opposed to just sensitive sensitivity or allergies which is a different type of you know um redness like I mentioned before now these are two other products that have SPF and they're kind of all on that same area between being a makeup product or being a skincare product and these are the first of the clinque uh City Block Shear uh this is kind of a tinted moisturizer with SPF so this looks a little bit more like Foundation um but it's not irritating and it has SPF 25 as opposed to these one that I just showed you that only has SPF 20 so that's why I keep it when I want a little bit more more coverage but I still want to kind of protect from the Sun maybe I'm going sailing or I'm going to a barbecue or to the pool and I don't want to look to like having too much makeup and I want to have uh you know good SPF protection and I will for sure reach out to the city blog in fact if you've seen my backups case video you've probably seen that I keep an extra one of these because that really really good and it comes really handy um the other one the L'Oreal nude Magi CC cream um this one is again very specific for uh redness and neutralizes redness and it also has SPF 20 so it would be a more affordable option to this one to the Clinique daily protected base uh broad spectrum with SPF 15 but it has SPF 20 and you can buy on the drugstore and it's more affordable than the cleaning one last thing I want to show you in that kind of gray area is the redness solution targeted corrector and this is actually a concealer um but it's also from the red solution line a yellow concealer so you would apply over your retinas here in this triangle and just Shear it out with a beauty blender and you would be um neutralizing that redness over there the only thing I have to say about this product is that it hasn't got enough yellow pigmentation and not as much as I would need to really concel my redness if your redness is not as bad as mine then this will be a good alternative but for me it's kind of too light so moving on let's start with my nighttime routine and of course at night I usually have makeup that I have to remove that I've used all day and when you have have sensitive skin that's prone to redness again you don't want to Rob your skin you need to find something that will literally melt all your makeup uh this may count as a surprise to you guys but the best thing ever I can recommend is the Johnson's baby oil with Alo Vera and Vitamin E this is really like uh harmless and it will require while minimum rubbing I wholeheartedly recommend this it is inexpensive if it's good for the baby's tushi it's good for your very sensitive skin the other option that I'm honestly almost out of but um it may be a good option if you're not if you have oily skin and you're not very you know you don't really like um using baby oil for your face for some reason this is amazing for me again this is my favorite I prefer a million times the Johnson's baby oil than the Clinique take the day off cleansing milk but if you guys want something more like highend and you guys like the Clinique line this is a very gentle um cleansing milk as well it's kind of not related strictly to retinas but I will show you anyway my eyes I use the Clinique All About Eyes reach cream pink smell one and it's depuffing it's really good good uh for my skin and it doesn't get my uh eye area red at all so I can you know rely on this cream um and the next thing I will do is depending on where I'm at like if I'm more allergic or if I'm not if I'm having kind of a rosacea flare again you can identify the difference because ration fles have have those little pimples and in that case I will use the retina solution again this one is the daily relief cream um I use it at night because it doesn't have SPF and because it's not it's kind of gel like I don't know how to describe it but it kind of creates a little film like a little layer and it's not good to apply makeup over I wouldn't use this to moisturize and then apply makeup because I've done that and and just my Foundation doesn't look good and it has a green pig [Music] uh that doesn't show at all when you apply it it's really really subtle and it contains amongst other things it contains green tea RG tested it's 100% fragrance free and dermatologist certified in reductions for retinas it's extra gentle oil oil free moisturizing cream that's appropriate for skins with rosacea like I said so if I'm feeling more like I have a rosacea flare I will turn to this at night um now that said right now for instance I'm not having any Ry Chef Wares so it doesn't make sense at all it won't help me at all if the redness is not connected with Rosa like right now it's connected to allergies and just spring allergies for that I only recently found like seriously the most the most gentle cream ever so happy if you have sensitive skin and you know what it feels to kind of not have it respond the way you want and be concerned about your retinas you will understand why I feel this way these will be also in my top repurchases for sure the aan sakom ad balm it's a lipid replenishing balm so it is oil based it kind of gives your uh your dryy skin the pits it needs and that sometimes is a cause for itchy skin and very very dry skin that it's missing the oils that naturally needs and for some reason you're not producing the genetic reasons or you know maybe aging or whatever reason it is and it's really important to know that it is recommended for babies as well again if it's good for your baby it's good for your sensitive skin and it for uh severe dryness it has 0 % preservatives 0% parabens 0% fragrance and 0% alcohol for me it's like it's a miracle I feel like I've nailed it with this product um and with the other one I'm just about to show you right now but honestly you guys if you are in the search and you have nail it by all means get a SLE or just you know get get a hold of it somehow get a friend to to show you or get someone at the dstore to to give you to kind of try it on you in the same line is the Evan tolerance extreme h u moisturizer it's a hydrating and soothing cream and it's for hyper hyper sensitive skins and uh allergic skin so again it's my type of skin the only thing I have to say that's not so good about this product is that it it has a very special um applicator inside it's supposed to avoid contamination of the product and you have to really press to get product out but when you do it's like a ton of product comes out and you don't really need that much product the balm the big one has the exact same applicator in the in the bottle and I don't have the same problem so that's it for my 2015

        "transcript": "let me guys get excited because this video is a long time coming I feel like it's been over a year since I did a tips for rosacea today's video I'm going to share with you guys dermatologist tips for navigating skincare choosing skincare and thanks to avoid and skincare products for people with rosacea one of my favorite skincare products for people with rosacea you guys know is Rosa care and I'm partnering with procure the maker of Rosa care on today's video so I'll talk a little bit more later in today's video on why this is a fantastic product for people with rosacea in their skincare routine if you have rosacea you already know what a challenge it can be to navigate the skincare aisle and select skincare products that do not irritate you staying burn cause excessive redness and irritation on your skin rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by hypersensitivity to things that come in contact with the skin and that hypersensitivity manifests with symptoms such as burning tingling flushes of redness heat and little red bumps that almost look like acne and pimples but are a little different in their underlying nature rosacea is an incredibly uncomfortable disease to live with so my number one tip for rosacea skin care and navigating rosacea skin care products is keep it simple keep it simple in that your routine and the products you use should not be excessive there should not be more than three products think about it rosacea is a skin disease in which things that come in contact with the skin are very likely to irritate you so reduce the number of things that you put on your skin that is my number one tip basic tenets of a skincare routine really for anybody but in particular for people with rosacea should just be three products a gentle cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen and I'll get into the details and nuances of those in a moment so that leads me into my next tip and that is cleansing your skin it is important to cleanse your skin and to select a gentle cleanser a non soap cleanser I have several videos talking about some of my favorite gentle cleansers for the face so I'll list those videos down below for you to check out things that come in contact with the skin from your environment so on the skin and can contribute to you prolonged symptoms and exacerbation of redness and irritation the way you cleanse your skin out is very important you need to do so in a gentle manner just use lukewarm water want to avoid extremes of temperature and just use your finger pads in a circular motion across the face cleansing your skin this way is important for everybody but in particular for people with rosacea because physical physical touch physical factors can also flare redness irritation and precipitate flares of your disease in other words things like spin brushes scrub brushes facial brush those harsh washcloths can be your nemesis so just use your finger pads in a gentle circular motion and then rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water my third tip is to use a moisturizer on a daily basis whether your skin is dry or oily you still really need to moisturize moisturizers hydrate the skin by trapping water onto the surface of the skin and sealing it there in place they also condition the skin cells smooth the skin cells and calm down inflammation for people with rosacea using a moisturizer is really important also because we know that in individuals who use a moisturizer along with their rosacea medications they have a better outcome to their treatment than if they don't use a moisturizer and the reason using a moisturizer is so important is that it helps just you the skin hydrate the skin reduce the likelihood of irritation and the way to apply it is to use it immediately after cleansing to damp skin so once you rinse off your cleanser in the face is still wet that is when you want to apply your moisturizer and the reason for this is that it capitalizes on the hydration status of your skin at the time of cleansing just as you wet the skin to remove that cleanser there's a lot of water on your skin so moisturizer with its ingredients will come on and we'll lock that water in place and really helped you drive hydration into your skin and see the skin and reduce irritations and doing so will reduce the severity of rosacea and we have several studies showing can improve your treatment outcomes with your prescription topical and oral medicaid rosacea medications it's a really important part of rosacea skin care now my fourth tip will come as no surprise to you all because I talked about it and any chance I get I will bring it up and that is to protect your skin from the Sun wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen rosacea patients have a challenge however in finding a sunscreen that will protect their skin without simultaneously irritating the rosacea so some tips for selecting a sunscreen are to select a physical sunscreen and what that means is that when you look at the active ingredients of the sunscreen it should say zinc oxide only or it should say zinc and titanium dioxide those should be the active ingredients these active ingredients are most well tolerated or people with rosacea they are not irritating they do not sting they do not burn on the other hand other ingredients in sunscreens that are chemical ingredients chemical filters things like oxybenzone Ava Ben's own chakra line these ingredients can really be irritating for people with rosacea these ingredients can cause a little bit of irritation to this these types and precipitate a flare so it's best to select a mineral only physical sunscreen and by that again I mean one whose active ingredient is either zinc only or the active ingredients zinc plus titanium dioxide those are most well tolerated and the sunscreen also should be labeled broad-spectrum and it should be an SPF a sun protective factor of 30 or higher in order to properly protect your skin sunscreen needs to be applied on a daily basis even when it's cloudy out this is because the ultraviolet radiation that comes from the Sun can come through the clouds it can come through your windows and can contribute to the inflammation in your skin and drive your rosacea so you need to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen on a daily basis some other tips the over choosing your sunscreen is make sure it does it's fragrance free fragrance as I'll get into later is a it can really be problematic for people with rosacea to make sure it's fragrance free look for ingredients like silicones silicones go by the name dimethicone and a few other names all lists down below for you guys to help navigate but silicones are well tolerated in moisturizers and sunscreens for people with rosacea there they tend to be lightweight they are oil-free and therefore are comfortable for people with rosacea hyaluronic acid is a humectant that will frequently be included not only in moisturizers but also in sunscreens and is also well tolerated in people with rosacea helps to hydrate the skin and in a sunscreen can really helped you combat some of the dryness that you might experience with using a mineral sunscreen they can be a little drying so those are some good ingredients to look for and some good features to look for in choosing a sunscreen check out my videos on my protection mineral sunscreens I reviewed several and again I'll list the video that I'm talking about it down below in the description box to make it easy for you guys so my this set of tips pertains to ingredients what to look for what to exclude the number one thing that you should excluding from your skincare products is fragrance I always encourage everybody to make every effort to exclude fragrance from their products to only select fragrance free products but in particular people with rosacea have to do this and the reason is twofold people with rosacea have a higher likelihood of developing something called allergic contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis happens when you become sensitized against an ingredient and then you develop a skin allergy every time you come in contact with it so they have a higher likelihood of developing an allergy to fragrance in their products and people with rosacea are also more likely to have flares of their symptoms regardless of allergy when they come in contact with fragrance why is that so well the reason is because fragrance compounds can function not only as irritants on the skin and drive inflammation but they're also things called vasodilators vasodilators make the blood vessels in her skin to dilate and bring more redness into the skin which is the opposite of what you want to do in rosacea so selecting products that are fragrance free is really important selecting a product oh it's fragrance free it's tricky to navigate because you might be duped into thinking that a product labelled unscented is safe unscented is not fragrance free when you read unscented be very careful because unscented often means the product contains fragrance and it contains a masking fragrance to hide the scent of the product so that you don't detect it with your nose but it's still there and fragrance goes by a lot of names so I will list these names down below in the description box for you guys so you know what to look for because manufacturers are not really required to disclose the inclusion of fragrance in their products I'll list those names down below for you guys so you know what or in addition to fragrance the other ingredient that you want to avoid it's kind of very similar to pregnancy is any type of essential oils lavender oil rose oil rubs hip oil any type of essential oil regardless of how it was processed and made can contain things like fragrance ingredients that while you may not detect them with your nose while they may not have an aroma to them they can still irritate and bother the skin of rosacea so avoiding products with essential oils is really important the other ingredient to avoid is the inclusion of alcohols in your skin hair products alcohols are frequently present in a lot of sunscreen will often have alcohol so you've got to look for that ingredient alcohol is also added to stabilize active ingredients in sunscreens so it's in a lot of sunscreens and for people in general you know alcohol and alcohol Danitra they're not it's not a bad ingredient it's not something to fear but for people with rosacea it definitely is something that can contribute to a flare of their disease and irritate their skin simply because it is more on the drying side and people with rosacea just don't tolerate that to the same degree as other skin types and other people with without rosacea so avoid avoid alcohol and then menthol menthol is something that has to be avoided you'll find men fell on a lot of face washes and it imparts a tingling sensation you don't want a tingles and rosacea and some other ingredients in that vein that are often out it includes things like peppermint as well which is added to make things tingle and then witch hazel I have videos talking about witch hazel and you know it can be irritating and it really can be irritating for people with rosacea the other ingredient to avoid is eucalyptus eucalyptus is frequently added as a preservative to products and but it has been reported as something that is really aggravating to people with rosacea there are some beneficial botanic ingredient so in rosacea and for rosacea care one of which includes niacinamide niacinamide is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for redness it can it can reduce the amount of redness and it also can help your skin barrier in healing and keep your skin hydrated so it is a good ingredient ceramides are also a good ingredient to consider or rosacea they are natural part of our natural lipid barrier and in moisturizers can help our skin barrier and then also licorice root extract is very helpful in rosacea skin care products because it like niacinamide can be calming out anti redness you will find licorice root in a variety of products that are labeled anti redness and kind of targeting people with rosacea so that is a good ingredient from a cosmetic perspective another ingredient to look for property in a product you look for is chromium or color correction with a green tint this helps to camouflage redness and even out skin tone very nicely the reason I like this product is they is specifically formulated for people with rosacea and they they have not included any of the common rosacea irritants there's no menthol there's no eucalyptus there's no fragrance so all the stuff I told you to avoid is not in this this contains good ingredients for rosacea including niacinamide which as I said is anti-inflammatory helpful for the skin barrier it also includes licorice root which is anti redness and thirdly it contains the color correcting chromium property so it can nicely helped you even out skin tone without masking things so it's not like a makeup or a cosmetic it simply helps to even out skin tone through that chromium these ingredients are evidence-based for rosacea so the formulation combines the wisdom of nature with the power of science to really deliver an effect product for our rosacea sufferers that takes the guesswork out of ingredients and navigating ingredient lists and in addition to those beneficial rosacea ingredients that I mentioned niacinamide licorice root extract and color correct and chromium this also is a nice rosacea friendly moisturizer in that it's got hyaluronic acid which is hydrating helps to hold on water into the skin as a humectant and has dimethicone and silicone ingredients which helped you seal in water into the skin and trap water there and prevent what's called trans epidermal water loss from the skin that could lead to dryness so this is a really nice lightweight and comfortable moisturizer to wear for people with rosacea or really honestly if you have redness in general it's also very good this product is oil-free it's not going to exacerbate and the acne clog pores it's non-comedogenic and I'm really comfortable to wear the way to use this is as a moisturizer to apply it immediately active cleansing your face to damp skin and allow it to dry you can apply it in the evening time after cleansing and then again in the morning after cleansing after after cleansing and applying this allow it to dry and then put your sunscreen on over for morning use I can buy it on amazon.com as well at CVS anyways guys that concludes the tips check the description box I will list the key features that I mentioned in today's video I hope it was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

        "transcript": "April is rosacea awareness a month and for those of you who know me in the channel you know that I've posted a lot about my struggles with rosacea some of the products that I've used to help overcome it and I say overcome it kind of loosely um I've come to terms with it I recognize what my triggers are I understand better how to maintain My Skin Barrier and most importantly focus on the treatments and medications that give me the best outcome for my skin I will say rosacea is definitely a marathon and not a Sprint as is most things with skin care there's rarely an overnight success or magic treatment that's gonna solve all your skin issues no matter what they are but certainly that's the case with rosacea at least that's been my experience while I have my rosacea pretty much under control I still have flare-ups I still have irritation I still kind of regress backwards so I just wanted to kind of sit back relax and do a little bit of an update video for you on how my rosacea my skin is doing now and what I attribute My Success to my skin in at its lowest point look like this but you can see now I specifically for today's video I'm not wearing any foundation BB cream CC cream I chose a tinted mineral sunscreen it's really new to me it was sent to me in PR it's naked Sunday's tinted mineral sunscreen I like the tinted mineral sunscreens of course because they offset the white cast overall my skin is just so much better than it was not to say that I don't still have flare-ups I do especially when I ignore my triggers which I know full well what they are red wine which sucks because I love red wine spicy foods also sucks I love spicy foods and my husband likes to cook spicy foods so yeah sometimes I have to suffer through the aftermath with my skin and the sun it's very hard to avoid the Sun but I do my best to mitigate that so I will wear a hat when I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time and I always always wear a daily sunscreen my view on sunscreen is honestly just find one you love and you use that speaking of setbacks recently I was traveling staying in a hotel room you know the air is different in the hotel room I was drinking red wine with dinner the climate was slightly different you can see on my face here how my rosacea flares and it's almost immediately so as much as I try to control my triggers and set the situation to be optimal for Success it still happens I'll tell you what I did in my story and hopefully you can just extrapolate from that something that may be useful for you of course you should be in consultation with a medical professional I'm not that I'm simply here to share with you my story and my experience so that hopefully it can arm you with some more information and help you along the way if nothing else to know you're not alone the Hallmarks on my rosacea is an impaired barrier Associated redness and flushing irritation inflammation and pimples back when it was at its worst this is what I did I stopped everything in my skincare routine basically put myself on a skincare diet I I went back to the very basics of cleansing and moisturizing my skin and when it comes to Cleansing just choose a cleanser that's very gentle and hydrating that's what worked for me I've used this Cetaphil Vana cream was one of my favorites uh this one by avino continues to be one of my favorites it's their common restore line and I wanted to call out this one this is the glucoside foaming cleanser and while this is a new launch from the ordinary I've been really enjoying this product for my skin my children have been using it too and they also have very sensitive skin it was tested on babies originally and it's just been a really lovely cleanser so back then when I was at my worst I wish I would have had something like this too I've also used cerave's hydrating cleanser it's really just about finding the one that works best for you within your price point I only cleanse my skin at night with a cleanser in the morning I use water only this is one of the ways I was able to keep my barrier intact the cleansing process just seemed to be too much for my skin if I was doing it morning and night so that was really a game changer for me for moisturizers I like to offer something that's rich in ceramides and that is a little bit occlusive to lock that moisture into the skin because one of the Hallmarks of rosacea is a damaged Skin Barrier it has trouble holding and retaining that moisture into the skin so if you can do that with your moisturizer you're ahead of the game so cerave's moisturizing lotion is a great one love regimen Labs cream this is their second iteration of this particular product they've actually improved the consistency and the applicability of this on the skin it's far less thick and more spreadable I'd say on the skin and this one's fabulous because it has ceramides as does the CeraVe one it's a higher price point for this but I just really love this brand for a gel type moisturizer going back to Aveeno this common restore line has just been really good for my skin I love this it's drugstore so it's readily accessible and great for my combination skin sometimes I don't want a thick Rich moisturizer this can be great in the morning and a thicker richer cream in the evening is sometimes what I opt for but another new launch from the ordinary they've improved or added to their natural moisturizing factors line and this one is their natural moisturizing factors plus phytoceramides so again just adding more ceramides into the formulation making this a really good moisturizer for rosacea in my opinion and also for those of you with dry skin when it comes to daily sunscreen my opinion just find one that works for you whether it's chemical mineral hybrid whatever it is tinted non-tinted cheap expensive if you're gonna put it on your face every day go with that one I'm being facetious because sometimes sunscreen can be irritating to some and you want to find the one that best suits your skin I've actually created a shop my which really lists the products that are my favorites by category those are affiliate links so you don't have to purchase through through those just look at what the products are and then you can Google and purchase on your own because otherwise I make a very small commission if you purchase from those links so if you want to great and thank you if you don't totally fine as well but the point is to be able to share with you what my favorites are by genre so I'll link my favorites below for my sunscreen category so you can take a look through there ask me specific questions in the comments if you have about any particular product all of the ones that are listed there are ones that have worked for my skin so I hope you find that helpful I did want to call it this product that came to me in PR this is by Dr jard it's your secret pair tiger grass Camp drops they're really neat and it's green looks kind of gross but if you know the color wheel green offsets or neutralizes red now this is an SPF 35 but I actually use this kind of more like makeup and then it's just giving me that additional sun protection so I apply whatever sunscreen I'm wearing wearing for the day and then I put a few drops of this over top and it really neutralizes the red so I'm kind of almost using it like makeup as opposed to sunscreen but definitely impressed with this product for me Beyond getting a basic skincare routine in place and focusing on restoring and repairing My Skin Barrier without adding in any active ingredients like retinoids and vitamin Cs and acids and all that stuff just keeping it to the basics I also needed medical intervention so at the time I was prescribed this which is metrogel this is an antibiotic gel often used for people who struggle with rosacea I can say that this was definitely responsible for getting my rosacea under control in that kind of acute flare-up phase that I was in once My Skin Barrier was intact and things were calmed down settled down that's when I could reintroduce the active ingredients into my skincare routine such as my vitamin C retinoids Etc so just because I have rosacea doesn't mean that I can't capitalize on those things it's just sometimes I have to opt for versions that are more sensitive skin friendly and when I have a flare-up I kind of revert back to the basics again just to be sure my Skin's under control before I reintroduce those active ingredients in my skincare routines the next thing and it's no surprise for those of you who have watched my channel for a while it's the thing that I actually attribute my kind of ongoing success with my rosacea is azelic acid I feel like it is really responsible for keeping my rosacea obey and maintaining My Skin Barrier overall I have used over-the-counter acelaic acid serums for years and I can say some of my favorites are Paula's Choice 10 azoleic acid booster and this one by theramid it's their acid or azid I'm not sure how it's pronounced but this one's at 15 azaleaic acid I was impressed with this one because it's actually the same percentage of azelic acid as my prescription and strength osoletic acid and I fairly recently started this prescription phenacea finessia tomato tomato I'm not sure but it's a 15 prescription only here in Canada as oleic acid now the different approach I've had with this one versus the other ones is that I was normally using those once a day generally in my morning skincare routine paired with my vitamin C but I've been using this one now for about six weeks twice a day morning and evening skincare routine it's another reason I love this as a product azelic acid it pairs well with so many other things it really doesn't have conflicts you don't have to worry about it I use it in my evening skincare routine paired with my retinoid in my morning skincare routine pair with my vitamin C the only thing I don't do is I don't put it in the same routine as my acid day when I use my aha or Alpha hydroxy acid it's once a week and I just focus on the acid and hydrating skin care products to surround that routine I'm only six weeks into this sort of regime so I will definitely do an update for you later on but already I am reaping the benefits of this overall I can feel that my skin is just more calm and healthy azelic acid has so many health benefits for the skin especially for rosacea it works to decrease the swelling the associated redness but is really effective at targeting the bacteria that's in the pores that can also contribute to the pimples associated with rosacea making this also a great product or great ingredient for those of you with acne prone skin of course there can be Associated side effects I think primarily those are tingling stinging and even drawing of the skin I personally haven't had that experience so I'd love to hear from those of you who perhaps have had that experience you can share that in the comments section below but certainly if you're using a prescription nasolic acid you'd be in consultation with a medical professional and of course they'd be able to talk to you more about that but if you're using OTC or over-the-counter azoleic acids just be aware you're experiencing that as well I will continue to monitor my rosacea with you and I'll do more updates as we go along and just see how my journey goes because I'm hoping it's helping you to understand more about the disease and spreading awareness which is what the April rosacea awareness month is all about I'll drop some information on that in particular below I would really really love it if you would share your thoughts experiences comments in the comments section below if you haven't watched them already be sure to watch these videos up on screen and I hope you have a fabulous day",

Dre here on YouTube she has some great videos on rosacea and I will link those in the description beneath my video but one thing she recommended that I have loved is this Alba lien I use this to take off my makeup it has the feeling of Vaseline but I love how it feels if you have dry skin and my skin has been a little drier because of the cream that I'm using at night from the dermatologist this leaves such a beautiful layer of moisture my skin even when my skin clears up from all this I'm going to continue to use this I also noticed that my lashes are better and I think because I'm getting out all of the mascara some of my other removers that I've used for mascara don't work as well this really takes the mascara off now while the Abilene is on my face once I feel I've covered area every area with makeup I go in with my vana cream gentle facial cleanser I love this all of these products I'm mentioning are in my Amazon store and I appreciate you supporting my store but this is beautiful it is fragrance free and it does not bother my skin at all or cause it to get red or flare up I go right on top of the elbe lean I don't wash that off and I just cleanse and cleanse until I feel like I really have my skin clean and then I rinse my face with water and that's it when I am done my face feels so clean yet I don't think my face has ever felt this hydrated I didn't realize how dry my skin was till I started doing this and this just leaves my skin feeling beautiful I have two moisturizers that I love if you don't have rosacea you just have dry skin or mature skin I am really enjoying this vanta cream this is their light lotion now they make - this is the light lotion I prefer this for my face and for my arms and legs if they get dry I love the vanna cream the moisturizing skin cream this is much thicker so it's perfect for legs and arms and especially feet I love this for my feet but another thing that I enjoy that dr. dre recommended is this procure Rosa care and this has an actual tint to it it's a moisturizer but it calms the face down it has licorice root in it and I think it really does calm my skin down I love to put this on it's got hyaluronic acid in it the licorice extract and it leaves a little tint of green which helps to conceal the redness at nighttime once I am done with moisturizing and I have my face really clean I go in with my prescription from the dermatologist my eyes a liqu acid but gel this is a 15% gel that he recommended for my rosacea now once this clears up and I feel like it's under better control I really want to go back to cure ology they've been working with me also talking with me about the rosacea and they've been fantastic my provider has given me some really good tools and information about rosacea but for now I'm on this now in the morning I don't use the Alba lean in the morning that's just to remove the makeup in the morning I wash my face with the vanna cream and then I also put on some type of lotion either this or the rosa care I really like this for the daytime especially because I'm trying to conceal any redness before I put on my now many of you have asked me Laura what sunscreen are you using I have a really hard time a sunscreen for years since they've come out there are certain ones that will break me out in a terrible rash like hives I'll break out in my chest my arms so I have tried dozens and dozens of sunscreens and it's very frustrating if you're like me and your skin is that sensitive what I found that his work for me does leave a little bit of a white cast so I let it dry for quite a while what I do in the morning is I do my routine first thing right when I get up and put my sunscreen on and give it time to absorb into my skin before I put on my makeup now I love this one and again this was a dr. Dre recommendation Eucerin this is a 30 sunscreen and it is a broad-spectrum sunscreen and it's a mineral sunscreen not a chemical sunscreen it has UVA and UVB protection now one that I went upon the recommendation of my doctor is vanna cream and this is their sunscreen sport I like both of them pretty equally now this is a 35 protection and again this is fragrance free so when I use these two I don't break out in a rash or get any kind of acne or anything from it one question subscribers always ask me is what are you putting on your lips for an SPF I love the lip protectant for benecrine it does leave a white cast but it almost looks like a pearl look on the lips of pinky pearl because my own natural lip color shows through now what you can do is rub this in and then I top it with a lip stick so if I'm going to be out and I don't want just this on I let this dry a little bit really rub it into the lips and then put a lipstick on top I also have very itchy legs and arms at certain times and so I keep a couple of products in my arsenal from sarahfey this itch relief moisturizing lotion was great for days my legs were burning itching and once I put this on it just took the itch right away within a day so this is a little miracle worker they say this also works on sunburns and inside right so this is something just great to have in your medicine cabinet in case you have any of those issues now also for my legs I love this Sara B moisturizing cream if my legs feel dry or irritated I put this on it sinks right in I love the texture of it this is thinner than the Vanna cream I love the Vanna cream for my feet elbows and everything but this is a beautiful texture I think for arms and legs a lot like the Vanna cream light lotion but this is another option that I feel is fantastic the winner of last week's giveaway for the Real Techniques brushes will be listed in the first pin comment join me in congratulating the winner I had so many people that have one comment how great all those thumbs up felt when they saw those coming that's just fantastic I love when we support each other and this week I have another Real Techniques kit this has a couple of their little sponges a mirror two brushes it's just fantastic these are great brushes that are affordable at the drugstore and I think anyone that wins this will be thrilled in the comments if you just leave for me something you enjoyed about the video or a product you're thinking of buying or a product you'd like to suggest for me to try thanks so much for watching",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video I'm going to share with you a simple straightforward effective skincare routine for clearing up blackheads white heads acne breakouts and for rosacea and that really stubborn cousin of rosacea perioral dermatitis this is a really easy routine anybody can do it doesn't require a lot of advanced thinking planning layering give this video a thumbs up if you like simple straightforward No Nonsense skincare routines that don't require like a lot of advanced thinking planning tons of products cluttering your shell I'm going to be using one of my favorite ingredients it's very underrated it's sulfur in the de la Cru maximum strength acne treatment this is a 10% sulfur mask I'm going to show you how to use it and while I do it I'm going to explain how it works what the benefits are and what to expect you want to get started by first washing your face you can just use a mild gentle cleanser I'm using this one by Neutrogena a favorite of mine the hydroboost with hyaluronic acid hydrating Gel Cleanser fragrance-free importantly when you wash your face always make sure to use lukewarm to Cool Water using really hot water not only can dry out the skin but actually can be really aggravating to conditions like rosacea and perioral dermatitis you want to make sure to pat dry the skin if your skin is soaking wet this product is probably not going to set up as as well now that my skin is clean and there's no water residue left on the surface this product is going to go on a lot more evenly a lot more smoothly to use this you just need about a pearl sized amount and you're going to apply a thin film to the face now I'm going to put it to my entire face sparing around my eyes common mistake people make when it comes to Skin Care is putting on a big glob all you really need is a very thin film of this it has a very moisturizing texture make sure to get my nose cheek area so as soon as you've applied this in a thin film to the entire face sparing the area around your eyes you're going to set a timer for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes I'll go ahead and do 15 while the timer is going we're going to talk about what what exactly this is doing what it's helpful for what to expect sulfur why would you want to use that in a skincare routine it has a lot of benefits for the skin if you weren't aware it's anti-inflammatory and it's antimicrobial it can help reduce the acne causing bacteria cutie bacterium acnes and it can also help control certain microbes on the skin surface that can aggravate conditions like rosacea your skin has these little mites hello kind of freaks people out they're called Demodex mites but in Ros part of the skin problem where you get these inflamed red spots is thought to be due to an abnormal response to those little mites and sulfur can actually help with that sulfur is also chotic meaning it basically unclogs pores it does this because the sulfur is thought to interact with cysteine the amino acid and the keratins in your skin helping to basically break up the glue between cells that are kind of stuck together in your pore the benefit of doing that is unclogging pores so you can see Improvement in blackheads and white heads otherwise known as open and closed comeone so for example if you get a lot of Comey dones on your forehead this may help you out if you get a lot of blackheads on your nose this is something to consider because sulfur is both anti-inflammatory and because it can help reduce the burden of the acne causing bacterium cutie bacterium acnes this can be a particularly valuable mask to consider incorporating into your skincare routine if you have acne whether it be acne that is predominant L hormonal maybe predominantly localized to the jawline maybe you have comedonal acne that's aggravated by hair styling products on your forehead and you're trying to clear that up or maybe you have acne on your body like your chest or your back you don't have to just do this to the face this product can help with those things sulfur is really underrated by and large some of the things I really like about sulfur and this mask in particular are that it's pretty easy to tolerate it's very gentle on the skin I mean it's well tolerated by by people who have the sensitive skin condition rosacea I also like that this product can be used alongside other treatments what we're doing here in this routine is essentially a form of short contact therapy what is short contact therapy essentially what it sounds like putting an active ingredient on the skin leaving it there for a defined period of time and then rinsing it off the advantages of short contact therapy are that you get the ingredient on the skin you derive the benefits but you minimize any side effects of dryness that's what we're doing here I've got a lot of videos talking about short contact therapy on this channel whether it be with troan or other acne ingredients like benzol peroxide so check those out but today we're basically doing a form of short contact therapy in contrast to some of those other active ingredients that we've talked about with short contact therapy though I want to emphasize that sulfur is pretty gentle on the skin it's actually kind of soothing the main side effects of using the sulfur mask are it can be drying some people find their skin itches when they use it and probably the thing that bothers people the most is the odor some people find that it smells like rotting eggs other people note that it smells like a match head basically the smell of sulfur now we're going to rinse this off the skin surface in my opinion I don't smell any residual sulfur odor using this product after I rinse it off but I have gotten comments over the years from people who are like I use that and every time I use it my husband or partner they tell me that my face smells like eggs so just a word of warning it can leave a foul odor on the skin surface that a lot of people don't care for but as I mentioned you can use it alongside other active ingredients it doesn't counteract other active ingredients and because it's relatively gentle overall I mean it may be a little drying but overall it's pretty gentle you can use it alongside other active ingredients for either acne rosacea perioral dermatitis for example in the case of acne you could use this mask rinse it off as we're going to do in a moment and you'll see see me do that you can rinse it off and then you can use your other acne treatments whether it be bzal peroxide troin aoic acid um topical dapsone you can also use treatments for rosacea along with this whether be topical icin which is sold by the brand named cilantro or topical metronidazol this is not going to get in the way of that it's gentle enough that you can actually do this on a daily basis comment below have you ever dealt with a bout of peroral dermatitis otherwise known as per orificial dermatitis it can be very frustrating and uncomfortable as the name implies often involves the skin around the mouth although it can involve the skin around the nose and around the eyes periorificial dermatitis is notoriously difficult to tackle head on and majority of skincare products actually end up irritating that condition but sulfur is something that is prudent to consider in the routine to address that condition again it is thought to be related to rosace the anti-inflammatory properties of sulfur are what is thought to be responsible for improvement in periorificial dermatitis with sulfur so in summary benefits that you might observe with a product like this are fewer breakouts fewer blackheads fewer white heads in the case of rosacea fewer papules which are those red bumps fewer pules which are those white pus fill bumps similarly with periorificial dermatitis you may note Improvement in the number of red bumps that you get with that condition and an overall just Improvement in the sensitivity that you experience with those little bumps if you've ever had that again those bumps they can sting and be really uncomfortable what if you don't have acne rosacea or periorificial dermatitis can this still be helpful certainly can it's chotic properties can help improve the appearance of pores does this have any anti-aging properties to it no there's nothing about this that combats skin aging how often can you do this mask you can do it as often as you tolerate it you actually can do it on a daily basis either as part of your morning skincare routine or part of your evening skincare routine and truthfully if you're motivated you can do it two to three times a day as tolerated so what I suggest is that try using it once a day for the first couple of weeks see how you do with it if it's too drying maybe go to using it every other day but if you tolerate it fine consider increasing it to using it twice a day by increasing the number of times a day that you use it you may note that that you get a faster onset of improvement of things like red bumps pules blackheads and white heads again everything in the skin takes time but by increasing the frequency as tolerated you may know that you get to those results faster than doing it at a more conservative Pace now if you'll recall from my video on short contact therapy one of the things I really like about it is that it gives the individual a lot of control and tweaking the duration of contact you can start out really conservative leaving this on on the skin surface for 10 minutes and then increase the duration of contact you may find that initially you only tolerate wearing it for 10 minutes and that it's too drying but with time you are able to tolerate it better outwards to 15 and 20 minutes and then again increasing from just using it once a day a few times a week to daily to twice a day I mean really it's going to be something that you can guide people who have drier skin maybe are more sensitive those that tend to be more on the rosaceous side of things they may find they have to be more conservative whereas people who have really inflamed acne they may find that they need to be a bit more aggressive and use it more frequently the spots of acne they can be quite thickened and so the penetration of this can be a little slow in those areas so by using it more frequently you may get to the end point that you're looking for faster okay now that the 15 minutes are up I'm going to rinse this off the skin surface something really nice about this product is you don't don't need to use cleanser to rinse it off the skin it's water soluble meaning it'll come off with water now you certainly can use a gentle cleanser if you find that that works for you I would suggest though just using water because the more times you wash your face with a cleanser that can end up drying out your skin too much and as I said sulfur can be a little drying to begin with and again cool to lukewarm water we're not going to go boiling the stratum corium here all right so now that I've rinse that off we're going to come in with the final step of this very simple straightforward routine and that is to apply a moisturizer if this is part of your evening routine or a moisturizing sunscreen if this is part of your daytime routine doesn't matter what the product is so long as you like it and it doesn't bother your skin I'm using the hadot amuji skin conditioning gel by nuturi this is a really lightweight hydrating gel it's beneficial in that it's going to replenish any moisture that I lost from washing my face and it's going to help keep the Skin Barrier protected and hydrated to minimize any potential drying side effects from The sulfur mask with moisturizer you only need a nickel to Dime sized amount again you don't need a big glob on there of course it's going to depend a bit on the consistency of the moisturizer that you're using so you can always add a little bit more if you feel that you need to but you don't need to go on in with a big glob from the get-go it just will end up wasting things now if I were doing this as part of my morning routine I would pat dry the skin completely and I would come in with a moisturizing sunscreen if you guys missed my video on the pure screen Plus Mineral tinted sunscreens from Neutrogena definitely check those out but these would be a great option if you have especially if you have very sensitive skin they're mineral sunscreens they're less likely to sting and burn in comparison to the All chemical sunscreen and you have four different shades to choose from there so that would be a great option okay where do you get this Dayla Cru sulfur oy you can get it a lot of places it can be a little hard to find cuz they sometimes put it like down at the bottom shelf but you can buy it at Walmart you can buy it at Kroger grocery stores I've seen uh Target you can also get it at like Walgreens r a CVS or you can get it on the Amazonian so it's pretty inexpensive and you don't need a lot of this you also as I mentioned earlier in the video You could also use this product to like the chest the back anywhere where you have breakouts this could be used and it can be helpful it can be used under the arms too if you find that you get painful breakouts there maybe related to hyro adenitis you may find that this is beneficial in those areas it can be very soothing and anti-inflammatory can this product be used if you were pregnant always discuss that with your treating healthcare provider but by and large sulfur is is considered to be safe to use in pregnancy can you use a sulfur mask if you are allergic to sulfa s u LFA the answer is yes sulfur is not the same as sulfa sulfa is a class of antibiotics that some people are allergic to but this does not crossreact with that okay I'm going to wrap this video up here I really hope that this was helpful to you guys straightforward effective three-step routine for acne rosacea paroral dermatitis really anyone could benefit from this routine if you're looking to incorporate sulfur in for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits um now on the end slate I'm going to link my video on how to do short contact therapy with benzo peroxide it's a great way to use benzol peroxide for your acne derive the benefits of that ingredient but minimize the drying effects benzo peroxide in contrast to sulfur can be a lot more drying and irritating so watch that one next especially if you're coping with acne breakouts but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] h [Music]",

        "transcript": "you have no idea why your cheeks are so\nred all the time today our topic is about rosacea hey wishtrenders welcome\nback to Wishtrend TV it's your girl Eunice in the house today\nI know y'all missed me well anyways guys on the last episode of do and don'ts we\ntalked about blackheads if you haven't seen that video yet go check it out\nright now or maybe after this video so today guys I'm gonna talk about\nsomething very special for those of you who are really really really frustrated\nbecause you have no idea why your cheeks are so red all the time I feel you guys\nokay I'm on the same page as y'all I know this can be very stressful that\nis why today our topic is about rosacea when blood vessels constantly expand and\ncontrast and they actually lose the string to contrast back that is when it\ncauses the face to flush there are three main reasons of rosacea number one is\nhormones the most common cause of redness the results from decrease of estrogen level number two is changes in temperature the\ntemperature differences between indoors outdoors UV rays or even long-term\nexposure to the cold weather are all changes in temperature that causes\nredness number three the skin barrier using the wrong skincare products can\ncause redness by damaging the skins barrier so now that we've learned about\nthe causes of rosacea stay tuned until the very end because we're gonna be\nactually talking about how you can prevent rosacea and tips on how to\nimprove it all right so for today's do and don'ts we\nhave prepared seven tips on how to prevent\nor to improve rosacea so let's get started\ndo number one: foods that help with facial flushing one of the ingredients\nthat is excellent is mulberry leaf now this is a cold natured ingredient and\nalso this is not just great for the red flushing of your face but also it's\ngreat for your migraines we want to recommend that you just drink mulberry\ntea it'll be really nice to drink dried mulberry tea or we want to recommend\nthat you mix with water and Mulberry powder together that's a great\ncombination too then the second food is beans beans beans beans I love beans\neverybody loves beans and for those of you who have went through rosacea due to\nhormones we want to highly recommend beans beans are rich in isoflavones and\nthey also function as female hormones DK over there say he doesn't like beans but\ni like beans and beans are very very good for you next food is a very\nfamiliar one it's oranges did you know that oranges contain vitamin P which\nfunctions to strengthen skins capillaries this helps them to be less\nsensitive to external irritants and this helps with rosacea number two cleanse\nwith cold water using cold water to wash your face or to splash it on your face\nalleviate actually facial flushing causing the blood vessels to contract\nalso did you know that putting ice on the roof of your mouth actually helps to\nlower the temperature of your mouth slightly lowering the blood temperature\nof the blood vessels that goes through your throats the brain detects the slight\nslight temperature change and contracts the blood vessels to alleviate redness\nespecially for special occasions where you really don't want your face to\nbecome red you want to prevent that it's great if you put an ice in your mouth or\nyou get a cold drink to prevent your face from flushing. do number three lower\nthe skin's temperature rosacea results as the face's\ntemperature increases so it's helpful to lower the body's temperature so if you\nkeep your feet or the lower part of your body cooled or in cold water this can\nactually help to prevent rosacea in addition to lower the temperature of\nyour face with skincare we want to recommend that you use products with\ncooling agents we want to recommend that you use products that has really\nexcellent ingredients or agents to lower the skin use a product that can actually\nlower the skin temperature by one degree and it will hydrate skin from deep within\ndo number four care for the skins with sheet masks now sheet masks\nactually care for the skin temperature as a whole thing it's an excellent\nexcellent thing prevent rosacea with sheet masks that not only hydrates\nand soothe the skin but make sure that you use a product that doesn't have\nharsh substances like alcohol artificial coloring and phenoxyethanol we recommend\na super super gentle type of sheet mask the gauze type of sheet mask to prevent\nrosacea and another thing is we want to recommend that you use products with\nceramides in it to strengthen the skins barrier or we want to recommend a sheet\nmasks that lowers the temperature of the skin so that I can prevent rosacea and\nnot only that it suits heat and it has gentle agents in do number five\nstrengthen the skins barrier using the wrong cosmetics actually damages our\nskins barrier making our skin more vulnerable to external irritants because\nof this we need to strengthen our skins barrier with the proper and right\nproducts prevent redness and strengthen the skins barrier by using products with\ningredients such as stearic acid caprylic and Capric triglyceride\nwhich was a very mouthful but work really well to strengthen the skins\nbarrier Do number six apply UV Protection UV rays expands the capillaries now this\nis why it's so important for you to avoid the sunlight and for you to put on\nsunscreen even though when you are indoors use a product that has both UVA\nrays UVB rays and that can protect the heat all at the same time this will help\nto lower the skin's temperature by preventing rosacea for you guys Do number 7: makeup that covers redness When covering redness it's important that you\nuse a yellow tone base to cover your skin now this is much better than using\na really thick or concealer that doesn't fit your skin tone with the full full\ncoverage so cover your redness this with a very natural BB cream that can cover\nyour redness and both your pores as well use a BB cream that is layerablel that\nis buildable because you need to stack it up a little bit to cover the rosacea\nand we want to recommend that you use BB cream with a very natural finish because\nyou don't want to use those BB creams often that has great kind of tone to it until now we have learned about the do's for rosacea now let's go on to the\ndon'ts for rosacea Don't number one processed or overly stimulated foods in\nparticular, fillers in processed foods actually causes rosacea so you should\navoid foods that can raise the body's temperature I know how hard it can be\nbecause I love love spicy food too but really really spicy food or salted food\ncan have an effect on rosacea instead nourish the skin with fresh produce and\nalso protein and carbohydrates and an adequate amount of fats Don't number two: harsh exfoliation those that tends to have rosacea also has\nsensitive skin isn't that true it goes hand-in-hand right so using a harsh wash\ntowel or using a scrub can actually damage our skins barrier and it can\nworsen our rosacea avoid harsh excessive foliation and we need to put our focus\non exfoliating while hydrating the skin at the same time use essence type of\nproducts that contains AHA to gently melt away dead skin cells while at the\nsame time that has really hydrating agents as well to moisturize the skin\nand to exfoliate the skin at the same time don't number three cleansers that\nleave the face dry cleansers that give you a very squeaky-clean\nkind of finish also washes away our natural oils this leads to harsh\nirritation and dryness making the symptoms of rosacea even worse those\nwith rosacea should use about two to three pumps of a low pH cleanser these\ncleansers actually leave a less of a dry feeling so let's care for our rosacea\nwith hydrating cleansers Don't No.4:  ingredients that trigger rosacea\nwhile you should definitely avoid harsh products like alcohol you should also be\nvery careful of ingredients such as peppermint eucalyptus and clove oil which\ncan induce rosacea so those with rosacea should use\nproducts with really mild ingredients that can calm your skin like Guaiazulene at\nthe last step of your skin care apply a generous amount of Guaiazulene cream on to\nthe spots or the areas that you have rosacea it will alleviate rosacea caused\nby heat and irritation not only that it will calm and regenerate the skin this\nproducts nickname is actually called the blue cream for the red skin so just by\nthat nickname you can get an idea of how effective this cream is to calm your\nrosacea more exciting news oh my goodness news for y'all I know that we were very\nannoyed because we love the blue cream and there was a tiny tiny little bottle\nof 30 milliliters but Klairs has answered our prayers because a new\nproduct is coming out it's the same thing but in 60 milliliters so it's a\nhuge tube for us to use and I thank Klairs for answering\nour prayers and making it bigger don't number five hot showers hot springs and\nsaunas a lot of us probably really love long hot showers and also going to the\nhot springs and going to sauna it's one of my favorite things to do with my mom\nhowever this of course can help with blood circulation but it is really\nreally bad for rosacea this constant exposure of heat actually expands our\ncapillaries so this can actually worsen the symptoms of rosacea don't number six\nblood pressure medicines blood pressure medicines actually expands the blood\nvessels so it has the ability to induce rosacea\naside from blood pressure medicine and angina medicine common painkillers or\nthe medicine for our stomach can cause rosacea so we want to make sure that you\ndouble check your medicine cabinet to be safe but to be more safe we really need\nyou to double check with your doctors because you might need these medicines\nokay all right guys don't number seven Don't drink alcohol. as alcohol is broken down in our liver\nit not only expands our blood vessels but acetaldehyde produced within the\nbody as metabolism occurs induces rosacea as well so because of this\nreason I know it's hard but for those of you who is struggling with rosacea needs\nto stay away from alcohol alright guys so that is it for today for those of you\nwho are really stressed due to rosacea we really hope from the bottom of our\nheart that this video could have helped and for the next video we're gonna\nactually have four reviewers episode it's gonna be super fun we're gonna have\na lot of hairy friends who try out hair removal products so it's gonna be super\nfun so you guys have to watch it okay alright guys thank you so much for\ntuning in until the very end and please subscribe and like this video and I'll\nsee you guys next time remember guys we're beautiful just as we are",

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can check it out also if you want to Deep dive on information about any of these skin conditions you can actually search Cassandra Banks and rosacea or Cassandra bankson sunburn or Cassandra bankson skin condition in the YouTube search bar and we've probably done a video on it specifically if you search Cassandra bankson how to treat a sunburn I've shared with you some of my best tips and tricks as well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this next video love you guys hey",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video i wanted to talk about a skincare line that you can get on amazon that is fantastic and has so many uses for so many different skin conditions and skin issues that i have to do a dedicated video on that it's a brand i've talked about in some other videos skin smart anti-microbial all of these products are hypochlorous sprays what is hypochlorous it's a compound oops i just knocked over a lash freak that i had sitting here anyways hypochlorous is a compound that our immune system actually makes the white blood cells in your immune system make it and use it to kill bacteria white blood cells are the first players of the immune system to kind of show up whenever there's an infection inflammation or irritation in the skin and this compound hypochlorous helps to kill off bacteria viruses and fungal infections this is another one of those ingredients that i consider medical grade as a matter of fact hypochlorous is a hospital grade disinfectant that's also safe to use on your skin who would have thought that something that is used to sterilize hospital equipment can also be put on your skin and be useful and importantly non-irritating yes that's right hypochlorus is very friendly for people with sensitive skin or rosacea prone skin it doesn't burn it doesn't sting it's not drying it's not irritating it is a great ingredient not only is it antibacterial but it's anti-inflammatory as well so it's really helpful for a lot of skin conditions it's helpful for acne at its root acne has as part of its pathogenesis a bacterial component cutie bacterium acnes is a bacteria that lives in our pores and plays a major role in acne now another ingredient i have tons of videos on that is fda approved for treating acne is benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide likewise is antibacterial but unfortunately it is super drying and burns and stings and can be very irritating hypochlorous is a nice alternative it's not fda approved for acne but it certainly can help acne a lot skin smarts has a facial spray that can be used if you are an acne sufferer and what i like about it is that it's great to take with you and if you find that you're somewhere and you're sweating a lot and this is a nice option because it's not drying it's not going to interfere with your skin barrier or cause irritation and can help with calming down acne calming down and reducing acne flares and related to acne now that we are all wearing masks a lot of people are seriously suffering with mask knee or acne related to wearing a mask basically the mask causes irritation from the occlusion rubbing on the skin and people are getting a lot of acne breakouts underneath the mask no matter you know even if you don't haven't been dealing with acne a lot of people are suddenly coping with it and the facial cleanser is great to just spray on your face you know around where the mask is going to be it disinfects the surface of the skin and can seriously help in reducing that so it's really convenient for the situation that we're now all faced with with wearing the mask and having that frictional irritation and bacteria and sweat get trapped in the pore but it's not just acne that this is going to be helpful for it's also helpful for rosacea rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that's characterized by burning stinging to otherwise innocuous things that come into contact with the skin and part of rosacea has to do with inflammation and perhaps some of the skin microbiome is disrupted and so an antimicrobial can help if you have rosacea and you've seen a dermatologist you already know that rosacea is treated with topical antibiotics like metronidazole or systemic antibiotics so there's definitely a bacterial component probably at play and at any rate at least inflammation is is at the heart of rosacea this is a great option this facial spray for helping reduce that inflammation and irritation beyond rosacea it's also fantastic and amazing for people with eczema eczema is a disease where you have an impaired skin barrier and a lot of what kicks off flares or exacerbations of eczema is staph bacteria on the surface of the skin and one of the ways that we treat eczema to reduce those bacterial related flares is by recommending bleach baths i have a video on the bleach bath method so i will link that down below for those of you who are eczema sufferers it definitely can be very helpful but for everyday use the hypochlorous plays a similar role in controlling that bacterial burden on the skin for people with eczema if you have a freshly cropped up flare of eczema you know it's open a lot of times it's oozing and i i would strongly encourage you to consider getting some of this to spray on that because it can easily become colonized with staph bacteria and that makes that eczema more stubborn more persistent it contributes to itch so this is a really useful tool for for people with inflammatory skin conditions i held up this particular product it's their foot spray the foot spray the hypochlorous foot spray is great for just that foot hygiene if you have smelly feet a lot of what causes the feet to smell bad is sweat and the bacteria that live on your skin breaking down that sweat and causing odor this foot spray will help reduce that bacterial burden and will help with foot odor it's also got anti-fungal properties so it will help in reducing fungal infections on your feet and your toenails it's not a treatment for foot fungus it's not a cure for foot fungus but it certainly can help when sprayed on the feet consistently so i love that they have that they have the foot spray yeah you can pick up a lot of little critters on your feet in the shower communal showers that's why they always recommend shower shoes but definitely consider keeping this in your gym bag and spraying your feet after like right before you get ready to put on your shoes and socks to disinfect them highly recommend it's it's great it's a great option for those situations now if you're somebody who deals with flares of bacterial folliculitis or really any folliculitis honestly this will also help reduce that those flares because of the anti-microbial properties it's anti-bacterial so if you deal with bacterial folliculitis which is one of the most common types basically the staff bacteria trickling down into the hair follicle and causing little itchy bumps this will help reduce the burden of that bacteria on the surface of the skin and and help in reducing flares of that if you have other types of folliculitis at least the anti-inflammatory component of the hypochlorous will help with that as well uh it's just a really useful ingredient and that condition hidradenitis superitivo that a lot of you suffer with it's a miserable disease to live with using topical antimicrobials helps control flares of that disease it doesn't cure it but it definitely helps so those are some skin conditions that definitely benefit from using hypochlorous what's interesting about the hypochlorous is it doesn't leave a residue on your skin that's why it's not irritating it goes to work right away it exerts its mechanism and then is converted to saline so it's basically just like having a little salt water solution on your skin so it's not irritating really friendly for sensitive skin oily skin i mean any skin type can hack hypochlorous oh one other thing i forgot to mention too you know a lot of people who have frequent staph infections staphylobacteria i was talking about people who have frequent bouts of what's called impetigo basically a little superficial staph infection a lot of times what's going on is that your nose is gets colonized without bacteria and you can actually spray a little bit of this around your nose to help control that and it can it can really help with that another handy dandy use for the skin smart hypochlorous sprays is spraying your makeup brushes to disinfect them i've got videos talking about how makeup brushes can harbor all sorts of bacteria and germs that aggravate your acne and cause problems i have videos recommending you know that you clean them regularly but seriously if you get some of this each time you go to use your makeup brush if you spray with this that will help even more it's not a substitute for actually washing the brushes but it it's just another add-on that can really help with the makeup brush hygiene one thing that's important to know is that hypochlorous is not the same thing as bleach bleach is a man-made chemical that is sodium hypochlorite whereas hypochlorous is something that your white blood cells make naturally now the hypochlorous and skin care products and disinfectants is technically man-made but uh you know it's not the same thing as bleach so what i'm getting at is that it's not going to bleach your fabrics or you know it's not the same thing as bleach it does have a bit of a kind of a subtle bleach like odor to it but don't be alarmed it's not bleached it's not going to bleach your skin or anything like that and like i said it is converted to what you know it goes to work right away and then it's converted to to saline which is you know basically just salt water and um i mentioned while it's naturally produced by your white cells the stuff in products and disinfectants is man-made and but the process of making it is actually very interesting they take um vinegar and salt and water and through a process called electrolysis make the make the hypochlorous the other nice thing about this at least from an environmental perspective is that you're not putting out toxic chemicals i hate saying toxic or toxin because the clean green beauty movement has just you know totally absorbed that beyond belief that term but i mean that there is such a thing as a toxin and an environmental toxin and this you know it's just saline so you know it's what's the ocean basically uh so from an environmental standpoint it's much better how do you use this you just spray it on your skin and let it air dry it dries in about 30 seconds and then that's it you don't have to wash it off because again there's no residue left behind and you don't have to do anything so it's really convenient for on the go and for disinfecting on the go and now the other thing i will say honestly so love the skin smart brand on amazon but they have all these different bottles and packaging and you may be wondering are they how are they different they're honestly not i get why they have them in different packaging because people are coming to their site looking for different skin needs specifically like for example somebody may stumble upon them looking for things for their feet so they can't list you know i can see how it would be very cumbersome to list every single thing on here that these are helpful for so they just make separate bottles to kind of target different consumers i'm fine with that i don't think it's manipulative or anything but do know that the ingredients are the same and all of these products so if you bought the foot one and want to spray it on your face that's fine if you have acne breakouts on the body this is fantastic easy too easy to get you know your back or your chest and it's it's not going to bleach your fabrics like i already said which is a downside of using levon benzoyle peroxide is that it can bleach your fabrics this doesn't do that now setting your expectations moving forward though um hypochlorous is not an fda approved treatment for acne so if you have active flares if you're having an active breakout of acne i would say benzoyl peroxide is still going to be your best bet for clearing it but this is something that can be incorporated into your acne routine to get control and to help but it's not going to be a substitute necessarily for benzoyl peroxide but down the road this might be something that you can use exclusively to help control the breakouts depending on the nature of your acne but in other words for acne it's not it's not a replacement for benzoyl peroxide necessarily but it has similar advantages that benzoyl peroxide offers in the management of acne without the risks of irritation bleaching fabrics dryness so it's very sensitive skin friendly you know a lot of people with acne have super sensitive skin they do not tolerate a lot of topicals this is something to to consider introducing into your routine in that case this is also great to take with you camping i know like we're getting out of camping season but i often get questions for skin care product recommendations for people who are going camping and they don't necessarily have access to like running water or anything this is great to take with you because you can disinfect your hands like a hand wash you can wash your face with it i mean it's not gonna remove makeup or anything it's not like a makeup remover but if you have acne and you are sweating a lot this can help um it's you know safe for the environment so you don't have to worry um and it's something you can take with you on the go i don't know how easy it is to carry this with you in a backpack but these little bottles are pretty lightweight so i don't know i think that would would probably be good enough so hypochlorous is a fantastic skincare ingredient i think it is under appreciated hospital-grade disinfectant that you can put on your skin that's not going to be irritating and is non-toxic literally uh as opposed to woohoo let's sell you a bunch of crap you don't need yeah it's a really good ingredient now is skin smart antimicrobial the only company that makes skin care products with hypochlorous or disinfectants absolutely not but it's the one that i'm most familiar with and so i thought i would make a video and feature their products because they're the ones that i have always recommended to patients and used myself there's nothing novel about the formulation of the hypochlorous that would make one brand better than the other so don't buy something if you already have it is what i'm getting at um but yeah i really like this company and i do recommend that their products um so i hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe i'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

        "transcript": "[Music] hi there i am dr sam ellis and i am so excited to share with you my morning skincare routine for sensitive and rosacea prone skin i'm a board-certified dermatologist and i practice in the san francisco bay area just for some background on my skin type i tend to be kind of dry and a little bit sensitive because i have a skin condition called rosacea that makes me prone to redness and sometimes little pimples or bumps especially on my cheeks and so that's typically what i'm trying to tackle in any skin routine whether it's my morning routine or my evening routine also i am in my early 30s and i just want my skin to look as glowy and plump and youthful as possible and so that is something else i'm striving for in my skincare routine this video is sponsored by vichy and i'm really excited to talk to you about their lyft active supreme ha wrinkle corrector serum and why it's a really nice addition to this morning routine all right let's get started getting down to business we'll get the hair out of the face the first thing i do in my morning skincare routine is just wet my face with water i don't actually go in with any type of cleanser and people be like but you put on a retinoid at night don't you need to rinse that off in the morning and no by the time you have slept on your pillowcase that has either wiped off or absorbed into your skin and because i have dry insensitive skin doing a cleansing step in the morning is just overkill it can strip the skin of those natural oils and protective lipids that you build up in your skin overnight while your skin is sort of resting and i want those there i'm not trying to take them away the only people that i would say maybe should consider a morning cleanse are those who wake up and have really visible oil on their skin or if you've been instructed by your dermatologist or other dermatology provider to wash your face twice a day so i'm just gonna that's loud dip down here splash a little bit of water on my face and then just sort of pat dry people will say oh you need to use like warm water in the morning to like open up your pores or cold water to close your pores your pores don't open and close that is just such bs just put on the water temperature that's comfortable for you okay and then i'm just patting my face dry to get it prepped for my first actual skin product that i'm going to put on it the first thing i put on my skin in my skincare routine is a topical antioxidant and i really like to think of topical antioxidants as a protective boost your skin encounters so many insults over the course of the day that might be uv radiation pollution the byproducts of the normal cellular metabolism that your cells undergo all of those things can lead to something called oxygen free radicals in the skin and these are just highly unstable molecules that bounce around and damage structures in your skin and what antioxidants do is they essentially neutralize those oxygen free radicals so that they don't have the opportunity to wreak havoc the topical antioxidant that i am using today is the skinceuticals floritan cf if you have seen my holy grail skincare items on my youtube channel you know i talk a lot about the ce fruit by skinceuticals but the florentine cf is a really nice alternative to that especially if you have sensitive skin and the reason for that is instead of having 15 percent l-ascorbic acid like cephrolic does this one has 10 and some people think they can't tolerate l-ascorbic acid but they just can't tolerate super high percentages of it so having the lower percentage makes it a little more skin friendly if you have sensitive skin this also has two percent fluorotin fluorescein is just a different antioxidant that helps fight pigmentation and kind of speeds up cell turnover and so it's really nice in the summer because a lot of people show more pigmentation when they have more sun exposure and that helps fight that at the end of my bottle that's devastating so for my face and neck i usually use like i don't know like a third of a dropper just drop it into my hands it's like about six drops i'd say just put it in my hands you can press and pat or you can swipe really doesn't matter neck and then my hands are usually a little damp with it at the end and i definitely put it over the back of my hands because even though that's not showing pigment now but i treat enough people in their 50s and 60s who are very upset by the pigmentation that's developed on the back of their hands that i know that i need to be protecting this right now the other thing i really like about this formula is it just feels very lightweight not greasy on the skin it absorbs in like 30 seconds so i can just kind of immediately move on to my next skincare step without feeling like i need to sit around in the morning and let it really dry down for my next step i am going in with a hyaluronic acid serum today i'm going to be using the vichy lift active supreme ha wrinkle corrector first of all there are some brands that are just famous within the dermatology community and vichy is one of them and it's because they put so much time and effort and research into their products to make sure that they're developing things that are safe and effective so i already liked so many vichy products i had a feeling i was going to really like this as well this is a 1.5 pure hyaluronic acid serum and hyaluronic acid serums are humectants they work by drawing water to the skin's surface to make it appear more plump more rejuvenated more bouncy more glowy all the things we want our skin to look like again like i mentioned vichy does the research so with this serum it actually showed a 47 reduction in the appearance of wrinkles and a 60 reduction in the appearance of fine lines after six weeks of consistent use so it is not just one of those hyaluronic acid serums that's making claims it's actually shown to be effective having rosacea and sensitive skin i really appreciate that this product is fragrance free and then it has of course the nourishing vichy volcanic water as well as a vitamin c for additional antioxidant support the way that you use this serum is take the cap off turn it upside down there's like a little squeeze here and you just release like three drops or so into the palm of your hand that doesn't look like very much but this product spreads really well and it slips just right over the surface of the skin so you don't need a lot and a little goes a long way you could apply this in the morning or in the evening or it's really gentle enough to use both day and night just press it in there again this product just dries down really well i've tried a ton of hyaluronic acid serums over the years and a lot of them just don't work well with my skin because they either pill up on the skin or they're like too sticky so i don't like how they feel or they just don't layer well with my other products and i just have not had any issues with the vichy one some people will ask me like is the hyaluronic acid serum really necessary okay nothing's necessary in your skincare routine except for maybe sunscreen but there are very few things in skincare that give you immediate results usually it's a waiting game for things to kick in and then do cellular change but humectant serums like hyaluronic acid serums because they're drawing that water up to your skin surface in real time you get an immediate boost in how your skin looks and feels and appears to everyone else and i just find that when i use a serum like this i get more compliments and who doesn't want more compliments i have my antioxidant serum on i have my hyaluronic acid serum on the next thing i'm going in with is my prescription azelaic acid 15 gel this is the generic for phoenicia and i use it to help control my rosacea azolic acid is a great ingredient some people would call it like a jack of all trades master of none because it is not super super potent but it is great because it is antimicrobial it is anti-inflammatory it fights excess pigment formation so it does a lot of things but for me i use it mostly for the anti-inflammatory properties it helps keep my rosacea bumps under control and it also does help improve my redness to some degree it has taken me a while to get my rosacea under decent control azoleic acid is not the only ingredient out there that helps with that there are things like ivermectin and metronidazole and oral doxycycline that i use a lot in my practice to help patients with more severe rosacea get control of their disease but i'm able to use azelaic acid alone for control in addition to using tretinoin in the evening so i'll just show you kind of the texture this is generic it's sort of like a lightweight gel so i like that if i'm going to layer more than a few things on my skin in the morning i tend for them to all be sort of lightweight so i don't feel like i have this like cakey thick mess building up on my skin uh for me i use about pea-sized amounts of about the same amount that i would use of like tretinoin and i start on my cheeks and i kind of work my way outward a lot of people want to know like if they're given prescription medications topically like how do you layer those with your other skin care ingredients and there is no perfect way to do this i really encourage you to talk with your dermatologist and strategize together one it makes your dermatologist aware of the other products that you're incorporating into your routine and sometimes they might want you to take some of those out for a little while and then experimentation so i found that when i layer my acetic acid over my antioxidant and sometimes over my hyaluronic acid serum i don't have any issues i still find that it works really really well and then azolic acid is something that can be used morning or night or even twice a day so a lot of the clinical studies on rosacea have people using azelaic acid twice a day and that is often how i will prescribe it in my practice but again once you've been working with a prescription medication for a while that's topical you can kind of play with it a little bit to figure out how it works best for you and now for the grand finale what do you think it is sunscreen you might be like dr ellis you didn't put a moisturizer on what is wrong with you even though my skin tends to be a little bit dry i do not find that i need an additional moisturizing step in the morning between the hyaluronic acid serum that pulls water to my skin surface and then the occlusion with azelaic acid gel and my sunscreen that is enough hydration and moisturization for my skin to feel good all day and then i use a more nourishing thick moisturizer in the evening there's nothing that says you need to put a moisturizer on twice a day like that is so arbitrary so you really just need to do what your skin needs and not what the expectation of what a morning or evening skincare routine should be as you might imagine being a dermatologist and then also being involved with social media i have sampled tested worn hundreds of sunscreens and i definitely have some faves so one that i really really enjoy is they can make mermaid skin gel uv spf 50 pa plus plus plus plus when you are choosing a sunscreen of course you want it to look good on your skin you want it to feel good on your skin but you also want it to do its job of protecting your skin from uv damage and when we think about the type of uv radiation that reaches our skin it's mostly uva radiation and uvb radiation uvb rays traditionally are infamous for causing sunburns and really being the most provocative in terms of causing skin cancer whereas uva rays we think of as more of the aging type of uv radiation that leads to sagging loss of elasticity fine lines as well as irregular pigment in the skin and you want a sunscreen that's going to protect you from both types of uv radiation when you look at a sunscreen label you'll have the spf that's generally talking more about how well that sunscreen is going to protect you from sun burn and then you have the pa rating and again that's not on every label this is a japanese sunscreen it tends to be more prominently featured on asian sunscreens and that pa rating can go anywhere from one plus all the way up to four pluses and it's talking about how well the sunscreen will protect you from uva radiation so when i see something that is spf 50 with pa plus plus plus the max pa rating i know that the sunscreen is going to be providing really good broad spectrum coverage and protecting me against both skin cancer but also the signs of aging i think this is a really nice sunscreen for the summer because it is super lightweight and it rubs in i mean it rubs in great it also doesn't have alcohol in it which i find is pretty rare for such a lightweight sunscreen that rubs in so well also because it is an asian sunscreen it has some more advanced uv filters that aren't fda approved in the united states but are very very effective especially at blocking uva rays this is like next level sunscreen in my opinion when you are applying sunscreen you want to make sure you are applying enough so really like a full quarter teaspoon for the face i'm going to be wearing my hair down today so i'm not really going to be applying much to the back of the neck but i'm going to make sure i'm getting like my entire face my neck back of my hands for sure also i feel like this sunscreen is so good if you have a beard or a mustache or just any other facial hair what other facial hair would you have oh sideburns because it rubs in so well it doesn't cling to hairs and i don't know that from my personal experience but watching my husband apply this and i don't know there's something cute about watching your husband put on mermaid skin gel you don't want to overly rub your sunscreen and i feel like i see sometimes you are just like rubbing and rubbing and rubbing and it's like gosh at that point half your sunscreen's rubbed off your face so i kind of like rub it in let it set up i will probably go back in and put another layer of this on in a second just because i find with more liquidy sunscreens rather than trying to put a full quarter teaspoon on it once i like to put like an eighth of a teaspoon on let it dry down a little put a second layer on and it just it makes the application a lot easier that way so going in with my second layer now make sure we really get the neck i also want to really make sure you hit your ears and like up into your hairline i find tons of little baby skin cancers little basal cells and squamous cell carcinomas hanging out on the tops of the ears especially in guys but also in women and then right at the hairline like up on the top part of the forehead so you just want to be really mindful of how you're applying your sunscreen because there are some areas in people that just get consistently missed and it's really that accumulation of uv damage over time that leads to both the signs of aging but much more importantly the risk of developing skin cancer that's all rubbed in i'm going to let that set up a little bit usually what i do is i'll go make coffee or do some type of other morning task while my sunscreen is fully drying down and then i can go in with my makeup once everything has set up okay that is my morning skincare routine thank you so much for joining me i hope you found it helpful or you learned something new if you want to hear more from me i do have my own youtube channel as well as an instagram account where i kind of take you behind the scenes day in the life stuff as a dermatologist thank you so much mixed makeup for having me back total honor love being here and i'll see you guys again next time bye",

        "transcript": "hello guys it's millie welcome back to another video um so in this week's video i'm going to be talking you through my skin routine i've done a couple of videos like this but a long time ago so i feel like it's time to update you on some of the products that i use because i know a lot of you follow me from my initial like rosacea video um so i'm gonna update you and give you a quick overview of all the products that i've been loving recently none of these are sponsored or anything like these are just products that i've been trying for a really long time now and that have worked really well for me so first off i'm going with the natural look today because whenever i talk about my skin like i like to just not wear much makeup like i don't have any foundation or anything because it frustrates me when people tell me like when i watch videos about like oh use this um product or whatever to treat rosacea and somebody's talking about like how it's affected their skin and you can't really see it so this is what my skin is looking like at the moment you know my eyelids look a bit sore because i have eyeliner eczema which is just like another one you know another skin issue to add to the list but hey ho this is what we're looking like at the moment i'm very happy with my skin to be honest at the moment i'm um keeping on top of my skincare and i feel like it's showing so that's exciting so if you haven't watched any of my other videos that's totally fine i'll give you a quick overview so i suffered with rosacea i first flared out maybe three two two and a half to three years ago now and it was really really bad and i didn't know what the hell was going on with my skin i had to do loads of research and this is why um that was sort of like the catalyst of me investing starting to like invest in my skincare routine and create a skincare routine because i didn't even have one beforehand so you know rosacea is awful but kind of like the silver lining for me is that i take care of my skin now and before i didn't i was just like moisturizing once a day that was pretty much it so i've suffered with rosacea i've suffered with periaral dermatitis as a result of using products to try and help my rosacea sharp my skin barrier just could not deal with it i've also suffered with most recently eczema um which is similar to periero dermatitis i guess but it's just the xml is on my eyelids and not like around my nose and mouth um so yeah and i have oily sensitive skin obviously i've got sensitive skin i feel like most people with rosacea have sensitive tint sensitive skin so what i've done is i have recorded me doing my skincare routine in the morning and in the evening so you can have a look at how i apply the products what the products are etc and then i will jump back here show you them a bit more in person tell them tell you what they actually do why they're beneficial for your skin um and we'll go from there enjoy the next clips hello it's very echoey because i'm in my bathroom so sorry about that but i'm just going to quickly show you what i take my makeup off with and what i do to wash my face in the evenings so i've got full face to make one foundation uh all day and i'm into the gym so it's time to take it off so just to remove my makeup i use the micellar cleanser water this is probably one of the things in my routine which i have genuinely never changed it has always worked so well for me it's never like broken me out it's never given me dermatitis it never stings like when i have dermatitis and i wear makeup on top of it um it's never made my rosacea worse it's yeah it is a product that i will be having in my routine for the foreseeable future i genuinely think i've probably used it ever since i started wearing makeup so maybe like 10 years so yeah very dirty but it gets off most of it and then then i go in with the double cleanse this is weird that i'm doing this out of the shower so what i do next where is it i wet my face and i double cleanse with always bit mucky with paula's choice oil reducing cleanser this is like a cream cleanser that foams like a tiny bit but not massively so your face feels like clean but it doesn't like strip it so it looks like this and i've been using this for about i want to say a year now on like my third bottle but now i'll wash that off and then obviously pat never rub guys i'm really sure everyone knows that this by this point so that's what i do to cleanse my face to take my cough and cleanse it i'm just gonna jump in the shower now and then i will show you my um like skincare post shower serums moisturizers all that fun jazz okay i'm looking like an egghead because i have a hair mask in where is it if you are interested i'll show you what it is because i am obsessed with it this is the hair mask i use nothing to do with this video i just absolutely love it the weller fusion intensive repair mask not sponsored none of that job it just saved my hair when i got a bleach for the first time and my hair was like what the hell are you doing to us um and yeah it's brand new as well and it's a huge tub so i'm gonna sleep with it overnight so when i've got out the shower my face is dried obviously just naturally um i then use the niamicide and zinc 10 i've been using this for ever since i really like started investing not investing but like getting into skincare and like trying to treat my rosacea i niamicide was one of the first things that i ever introduced and it's staying and it's not going anywhere and then i just wait for it like a couple of minutes to let that dry so once that's dry i then go in with the sand and sky tasmania spring water which i have not been using for too long so i'd say like all together and i've been using it for like three or four months and my skin is loving it it's got hyaluronic acid in it i've never used hyaluronic acid before so yeah i was reviewing it like trying to repair my skin barrier and i'm absolutely hooked on it my skin is hooked on it and i would recommend it to anyone it's to be honest it's pricey um i think it might be like 40 pounds but a little goes a long way like and also i only use it in the evenings so it really does last me a long time so say that's 40 pounds and i've had it for about four months and i've got like i don't know if you can see i've got like three quarters of bottlenecks but i love it my skin is obsessed with it so i am obsessed with it and then when that is dry i go in with my neutrogena hydro boost gel this has lasted me so long i've been using this for about eight months i would say now i was getting really dry skin when i was traveling in the van um but i didn't want to have like an oil cream based moisturizer because i just knew that that would equal um spots like breakouts for me so i did a bit of research and this is a hydro so it's a gel based cream if you can so it's not like a lotion i'm almost out there you go that shows how much i love it and i only use like a tiny amount because a little bit also goes a very long way rub it my hands and then i spread it everywhere and it's like it's a gel consistency i honestly i'm so ugh i love it before i bought this i wasn't even moisturizing because i was too scared to moisturize to make my skin like oily but that's actually like probably the worst thing i could have done because your skin like barrier needs moisture like it needs the moisture and i was massively depriving of that so yes absolutely love this would highly recommend to anyone with oily skin so i let that dry and then i do my eye stuff just before i go to bed so i will check back in with you then okay so i'm going to bed now and i have just put on my cream recorded it and then i've i'm free done it basically so i use the uh this is a prescription cream that i got for my dermatitis in australia and i use it for my eczema i use it for my eczema um that has been on top of my eyelids so i literally take i'll show you that much like the tiniest amount possible and i spread it on top of my eyelid like up here and then under here as well i've just done it so it's still damp and then when that has soaked in a little bit i then go in with the set um it's not cetaphil i don't know what i always say the avene sulfate maybe the restorative cream if you have eczema dermatitis any of that jazz i'm sure you'll have heard of this because it is a lifesaver for those dry itchy rashes that you get and same again i just put like a tiny tiny dab on and then i put that on top of my eyelid and underneath my eyes and the combination of this has been working very very very well for me for the last month my eyelid eczema is a lot better um but yeah so that bit isn't rosacea related but for example dermatitis these have been great but that's my evening routine done i'm going to bed and i'll see you in the morning for my morning routine good morning guys um yes i have got hair and i had my hair yesterday i put um hair my skin has slept overnight and i washed it off and that's amazing um so i have had a shower i washed my face just with the um paula's choice oil control again you've seen that already so i didn't need to show you you can kind of see my eyelid eczema this morning like it's just a bit like puff it's always seems to be worse in the morning but after i've washed my face what i do is i go in again with the ordinary nyama side and zinc and i am aside makes a good base for a cup and then always just pat it in because at the end of it rubbing it it gets a bit tacky so i let that i let that dry for two secs and then i go in with this is a product that i have only just been using for about two weeks now and i am obsessed this is gonna pronounce it wrong everything the erisan sun protection um factor 50 oil control sun gel to cream which you can feel straight away in the texture that there's like less oil in it this is what the bottle looks like and then it comes out like a little cream so i do like a pea size amount and i spread that on my face and i like it because it dries quite tacky like obviously it's mattifying but underneath makeup it's really nice because like your foundation really sticks to it um [Music] but i'm not really wearing foundation today and then i will go in again with my dermatitis stuff for my eyelids and that is it let's go back to the main portion of the video okay so first off i'm going to it's going to be super quick um so this is the oil reducing cleanser that you saw me use this is paula's choice or juicing cleanser this is like my third bottle of this i would say so when i was in australia i was wearing a sun cream every day and i started to get blocked pores like a lot and the cleanser that i was using i think it was the cetaphil gentle cleanser just wasn't clearing my pores and wasn't taking away like the oil from my skin and then that was leading me to have like blackheads and breakouts so i absolutely love this it does what it says on the bottle oil reducing cleanser it has really really helped me keep on top of my oiliness and it's only a combination which is quite good because as i mentioned i've got i sometimes have um like dry spots because of my eczema or peril dermatitis and it also removes makeup which i love so i obviously use the micellar water to remove my makeup with i'm not going to talk about my salad water because that just helps it doesn't really help my skin it's just a makeup remover isn't it but it's just very gentle which is why i use it but then this is a calendar and also a makeup remover as well so it's like a double cleanse which i love um just to fully clear my skin of any foundation if i've been wearing it yeah that is the cleanser skin balancing if you have oily skin i would highly highly recommend um because it's worked great for me so next up i'm sure loads of people know the benefits of this already getting five guys niamicide and zinc 10 percent is it so niamh said 10 zinc 1 so the most important thing for rosacea is niamicide is anti-inflammatory which means it will reduce the redness the like inflammation in your skin which will reduce your rosacea which is you know that was the main point of why i started using it in the first place it also regulates oil in the skin so on the oily side of things that was really great for me it minimizes the appearance of your pores and also over time it actually reduces the size of your pores which i completely agree with i 100 agree with that when i have been since i've been using this my face has been so much more plump so much more smooth and i imagine that's because my pores are less visible next up is the um so this is the sand and sky tasmania spring water which contains hyaluronic acid so i have absolutely hooked on this product this is the newest product that i've been like introduced into my routine um and yeah i am very very happy that i took the plunge and tried it so what hyaluronic acid does and what i've been fine didn't it do for my skin is it is super hydrating and so it actually helps repair your skin barrier so rosacea is commonly combined with a damaged skin barrier which means you can see the redness on your face easier you can see the visible um veins underneath your skin because your skin barrier is so thin and damaged so a product like this hyaluronic acid will put the hydration back into your skin and it will help build up your skin barrier um and make your skin stronger which means obviously the redness and the lines um on the like beneath your skin will be less visible i did a whole review on sand and sky products um because i was using their hydration kit which was like a bunch of different things and i absolutely loved that so this is the one that i have kept on from that little experiment yeah if you're interested in that i'll link that somewhere below next up is a very basic product i feel like the neutrogena hydro come on why does it not the neutrogena hydro gel i am almost completely out of it i use it every day but in the evenings but not like a huge amount um this i absolutely love it's thick when you pick it up but when as soon as you rub it into your skin it honestly feels like it's like a gel water so it doesn't feel oily at all i wonder if it is actually oil-free yeah it's completely oil-free so that makes complete sense um it absorbs into your skin straight away like you don't feel it's sitting on like top you don't feel oily i just absolutely love it it's been an absolute godsend for me and another thing i would recommend if you have oily skin for sure the final main product i'm going to talk to you about is honestly i don't want to butcher the name by trying to pronounce it erosion probably not but this is the new spf that i've been trying recently i've been trying this for about two three weeks now so it's also a gel cream so very similar to the um moisturizer so it must be oil-free or so i don't know if it's oil-free but it's definitely oil control sun gel to cream ultra light um i have been really enjoying this i will be completely honest with you so i was originally putting it all over my face and then my dermatitis no my eczema on my skin started to get a little bit bad again like it started to sting and i don't know if it's because of this or because um i was wearing foundation for like a few days in a row and i don't usually do that i usually wear it like two or three times a week so just to counteract any issues that i might be having with it i just now spot apply this by spotify i mean like i put it on my cheeks rub it into my cheek cheek forehead nose and chin and i will just like avoid my whole eye area whereas before i was literally like doing everywhere so i'm still loving it and i really really hope that my ex my eyelids like stops playing up because i haven't broken out and my skin still looks really clear no extra blackheads so i'm really hoping i can continue to use this effectively finally last up this is this is just going to be super quick because these are more like one of them is a prescription this has so many because i got it from australia so this is what i've been using for my eczema so far so good um it's definitely helping keep it under control it is a common known prescription uh cream for eczema and then also i always use this whenever i'm struggling with any dry patches or eczema or anything like that is a highly highly intensive hydration cream it literally says it's a restorative protective cream so i smother my eyelids in this before i go to sleep and they love me for it in the morning so yeah that is another one if you have eczema or dermatitis it reduces the redness and like the anger of the skin um massively so that is pretty much it for this week's video i hope you've enjoyed it i hope it's been useful i know that like my other videos have been more specific for rosaceae skincare um but i just want to clarify i still have rosacea so all of these products work for rosacea because if they didn't i wouldn't be using them um they just also happen to work for people with oily skin people with sensitive skin and people prone to eczema and dermatitis so yes that's it thank you very much for watching and i'll see you next week's video bye",

        "transcript": "if you've got redness or rosacea or even just sensitive skin i think you might like today's video i'm going to go through some new skincare things that i've found that work really well for me hiya i hope you're keeping well as i mentioned today i'm going to go through some new skincare things that i've found that are working really well for my rosacea i've got two types of rosacea subtype one which causes flushing of the skin and subtype two which causes the texture that can come from rosacea so keep that in mind when i'm working through these suggestions and also something i always love to remind you of is that i'm not a doctor or a dermatologist and none of this should be construed as medical advice but that said it's nice to have a bit of a touch point if you've got similar skin so i just thought i'd share them nonetheless as always everything i've mentioned is listed in the description of the video which is now at the bottom of the screen so you'll see the beginning of a caption if you tap that a full list will expand of all of these things okay i'm gonna kick off at the top with a really strong statement this moisturizer is one of the best things i've ever used for my rosacea whether you've got that or whether you just want a lovely all-rounder moisturizer you might be watching this and you don't have rosacea i cannot recommend this enough and it's the la roche posay ultra wheat cream now this has been around for a while i only tried this for the first time a couple of months ago and if you've tried any of the um talarian ultra range from la roche posay it kind of comes with a bag and the bag gets smaller as you use the product so you can see i'm kind of on my way to finish in a second bottle do you know what i love about this so it was designed as a night cream but i honestly think that you can use it twice a day i've been using it twice a day when you fall into this hole of your rosacea and you get your medical advice a lot of your routine will i'll speak to my experience your routine gets a bit more simple a bit more dare i say boring and lots of your creams are there to kind of target and treat the redness and so you miss the fun that used to come with your skincare now what i love about this is that it's really silky it feels like a cosmetic cream that just feels lovely feels hydrating it sits beautifully under your makeup which again lots of quite rosacea friendly creams are that bit richer and you often have to leave them a little minute before you were to put your makeup on it's just fantastic really densely hydrating lightweight does the job great for twice a day and one thing i meant to say i'm glad i've remembered at the top of the video i want you to keep in mind when i'm going through these suggestions that because part of my job is making lots of videos i probably use skincare a bit more quickly than someone else would because on any given day if i've removed and reapplied makeup a few different times i personally redo my skincare or at least a chunk of it every time i do that so even though i've got a few things to show you realistically you wouldn't get through things as quickly as i would because you're not taking your makeup off that many times a day probably now while i'm talking moisturizers one of my moisturizers that i would really recommend to you in particular if you've got quite dry skin is the cerave facial moisturizing lotion now a lot of the products at cerave they are obsessed with ceramides and so ceramides are great for rosacea they're an ingredient that will help to repair your skin barrier and essentially if you've got rosacea your skin barrier is most likely compromised and so you want to get it feeling that bit stronger again now all of the cerave formulas are really hydrating but what i like about the facial moisturizing lotion is that it is hydrating but it's relatively lightweight and so you could wear this under your makeup um it's a bit richer i would say than the ultra nui but again very moisturizing now they have just brought out i'm just rubbing the excess on my arms as you do a version of this that contains an spf 50 brilliant for this time of year would really recommend i've been using this for a couple of weeks the one thing i did want to show you is that you will see a marked difference in the texture and appearance it still sits really well is lovely and hydrating and you know is just as comfortable as the original facial moisturizing lotion but i wanted to give you a heads up that spf 50 has significantly changed i would say the texture and the richness and so definitely want to give a go but keep in mind it's not going to be the texture that you're used to now then this next one isn't necessarily designed to target or treat rosacea however if you've got redness and rosacea it's likely accompanied by potentially dryness tightness those kinds of feelings of discomfort i just wanted to put you on to the bye bye lines serum from it cosmetics this is a hyaluronic acid serum a couple of drops of this slotted into your routine whether it's under your makeup whether it's in the evening will really make a difference not only to how hydrated your skin is but how it will hold on to makeup and i really like this one because a bit like i explained about the ultra nui um it's lightweight enough to make a difference but still sits really well under your makeup have you ever heard of that technique where you if you've got a bit of bad news to deliver you do a nice chunk of good news you say the bad news and then you finish on the good news again so i'm gonna give you some bad news in the middle and then we're going to go back up again into a nice happy ending but i really feel gutted about this and this is more of like a public service announcement part of the video i absolutely love the event tolerance extreme cleanser what i love about this is that you feel like you're taking your makeup off with a moisturizer when i first learned about my rosacea i was really encouraged to use a cleansing cream and i was thinking i actually i know i'm fairly natural today but i wear loads of makeup in particular eye makeup and like i don't want to have to use a separate eye makeup remover separate this is separate that i like one thing to do all of those jobs and so when i was thinking about these cleansing creams as much as i loved the idea of something really hydrating i was thinking well is that going to get my eyes off then i started using this it will get every bit of stubborn eye makeup your face everything all off you can get right into your eyes and it won't irritate them i am actually so crossed with myself now because i feel like i always buy this and always have it in the bathroom and i know i've mentioned it a good few times before but have i actually gone berserk about it i don't know it's been discontinued now when a product gets discontinued what will happen is they'll stop making it and stop listing it on the website but if you think of like if you're a brand you're on your own website you might be on cult beauty look fantastic boots all of these different stockists so basically i have stockpiled this i got a load from look fantastic but even at lots of different places if that's one of your favorites which i know from having chats on here it is quite a few people's favorite i'm sorry to tell you it is time to stockpile as an alternative to that the la roche posay derma cleanse would be kind of one of the closest matches that i would recommend that is great and readily available the derma cleanse again will get all of your makeup off and you can use it around the eyes and all of those things i've just described but i would say the texture of that feels more like a gel cream whereas that is like a moisturizer cream and so bit of sad news but you've got the heads up now if you can find it in your local store or wherever you usually get it do that before it's gone now i've got a few more suggestions i wanted to share with you that slightly more of an investment now in particular when you're considering the price points of these things i think it's a really good time to remind you that the best way for you to get really accurate advice on your skin is to see your gp or a dermatologist or someone that can give you a one to one because as i mentioned at the beginning my symptoms and skin could be completely different to yours so just keep that in mind but that said i've got a few things here that i think would be of great interest the first one is this skinceuticals hydrating b5 mask and this is a very intensely hydrating gel and i would say to you with that the first time i used it when i woke up the next day have you ever used a different conditioner in the shower and literally as you're rinsing it off you can actually feel already that there's a difference and straight away you notice the step change that's how i felt that's how my face felt when i washed this off the next day incredible because i have a lot of dryness with my skin i really felt that it quenched that and made a really noticeable difference however one thing i want to be really clear on is that the first time i used this it made my skin quite red years ago i remember learning that especially when you're working with active ingredients the a tingle is okay but if anything burns you need to get it off straight away so i put that on and i was definitely feeling a tingle and like for example um you've got vitamin b5 in here lots of hyaluronic acid it's really even though it's got active ingredients in there it's not necessarily full of like exfoliants or anything like that so i was thinking okay starting to tingle my face flushed to quite red but it felt really comfortable and it wasn't burning and i thought you know what i'll just see what happens and leave it where it is woke up the next day skin was absolutely great it felt brilliant there was no more redness and then funnily enough i think that was maybe the weekend and then in the week i was attending a skinceuticals launch of something else that i'm going to show you really lovely session and i spoke to the dermatologist there and i explained what had happened and she said to be honest it might just be if you haven't had any adverse symptoms the next morning that your skin is getting used to it or maybe you were a little bit more sensitized that day so just give it another go if it worked well for you and see how you get on and i've used it several times since then and i think it's really great um i would say that instantly when i say instant i mean the next morning because if it's any kind of hydrating mask i like to sleep in it first of all to let it do its job and second of all like that's an investment i'm not washing it off after 10 minutes i want it to work overnight um i feel a really noticeable difference after having used it and i've only used it a handful of times both because i want to kind of savour it and also i don't think you'd need to use it loads because it does the job so well that you feel quite quenched um if you're looking for something to kind of step charge your routine every so often or something that would be lovely to use the night before a special occasion things like that i would really recommend it while we're on skinceuticals i also wanted to show you the phyto a plus brightening treatment which is a daily moisturizer they've created that contains azelaic acid now for me personally having the subtype 2 rosacea with the pustules azaleaic acid as an ingredient is one of the only things that has reduced the pustules really really drastically but the thing with that is a lot of the azaleic acids that we have access to you need to have them prescribed by a doctor now i am using prescription creams at the moment this is something as well i wanted to mention in the video since last summer i've been using skin and me which is incredible i cannot recommend it enough i've previously done quite in-depth videos about skin and me but having used it for nearly a year i just cannot recommend it enough if you want a you know easy to access online service where you are sent a formula that works for your skin definitely give them a go however i very recently finished my subscription to them and i've gone back to my prescription creams one of which is a 15 azelaic acid um i see dr emma wedgeworth i can't recommend her enough if you want more information about your skin whatever your skin condition she's got so many videos on her instagram page she also has them on youtube because um she works with dr sam bunting and so sometimes they do videos together if you want to see a consultant dermatologist in real life and have that one-to-one i would thoroughly recommend emma she's fantastic and the azaleic acid that i'm using from hair is a 15 the azelaic acid in here is a three percent so it's definitely gentler than what you would get in a prescription form but a great way to try the ingredient if you haven't already again i'm only about halfway through this so i'll give you a thorough run through of this once i've finished the bottle because this again is an investment and one thing i would say to you about skinceuticals you know all of the products i see they have various different price points and i think sometimes it's important to understand why something is that bit more with skinceuticals one of the main reasons that that is more of an investment is that the way they kind of test their products and tell you that they're working or show you their findings is that they conduct clinical testing like so often you'll see on a product oh 50 of users said it felt great 90 said it felt amazing but that's just a person's opinion whereas skinceuticals literally test things in a clinical environment they publish medical journals to show the findings after everything and they're really geared to that more um use for a medical environment and so that's why it's a bit more of a step up and you'll notice as well with skinceuticals that they are only available to buy in places where you can also have expert advice and have that really thorough one-to-one so if you're interested in them as a brand i have to say i've used several things from them and i think they're really fantastic but because it's such a step up and that they are working to such a sophisticated level i would really recommend that you have a one-to-one with someone before you consider any purchases from them just so that you can take away something that is absolutely tailored to you and then one last one that might not be for everyone but honestly i i'm delighted because i don't tend to exfoliate necessarily and i feel like i've found something that i can ever slightly exfoliate here and there but i'm being really cautious with it when i first got diagnosed with rosacea the doctor that rosa that diagnosed me was dr stephanie williams she has bought out her own cleanser this brand delo um the radiance and rejuvenation cleanser now this is described as being for breakout prone skin with aging concerns but during rosacea awareness month her team reached out to me and said this is absolutely safe within reason and with caution to use on a rosacea prone skin would rose like to try it so delighted i've been using it then since uh middle of april say um but because this is a very kind of gentle exfoliating cleanser when i looked at the website in terms of instructions to use for an everyday user the advice is to use it every other day build up your tolerance then you can get to every day once you've built up your tolerance to that you can go to twice a day i'm not following that at all i am using this maybe once possibly twice a week i'd say on average once and the way is let me show you a little bit of it on my hand it's very runny and then when you get some water into this it emulsifies i don't want to say it's a foam because it's not a foam but it just kind of lathers up a little bit and i tell you what the minute i have finished using this my skin feels smoother and one thing i will say is that it also feels a bit tighter so the minute i get out of using it i'm definitely straight to like a rich moisturizer to counteract the fact that it has exfoliated but like in particular say my forehead where i don't know if you can see today it's a bit of a dull day i get a good bit of texture there it just feels completely smooth and i would say that even though it does have a lot of active ingredients in it for me every now and again it's that nice little thing i can slot into my routine to just have my skin feel a bit smoother um how it was described on the website which i would also agree with don't use it to take your makeup off almost use it as a bit of a treatment step so use your different cleanser you discontinue the vein cleanser while you can um to get your makeup off and then follow up with that if you want something really smoothing so those are a few newer things i wanted to share with you but in all honesty i actually filmed a version of this the other day and i didn't put it up because it was about this long the truth is with rosacea i know this is really boring and i'm always saying go back to the old videos but once i found something i really like i stick with it and so previous videos that i've done about my routine or things that i recommend a lot of those are still in my everyday makeup and skincare routine so like for example this was just next to me when i was coming to film the la roche posay micellar water i'm not going to have a big song and dance about it yet again but that is my everyday makeup remover i use it all the time and i've shown you that a million times and nothing has changed and things like if i want a balm one evening i live the elemis naked cleansing balm i'm thinking about what's in the bathroom um the talarian sensitive rich cream for when i want a bit of a richer moisturizer things like moisture surge from clinique all of the old things that i've previously recommended to you very much still stand and there were a series of videos i did last year that i will link in the description here that were kind of um you know do you want something for redness and oily skin do you want something for redness and dry skin do you want something affordable are you happy to stretch to something that has a few more active ingredients in it all of these kind of things i've probably covered in a bit more detail in another video so i just thought i'd focus on the newness today and the things that i've been using a bit more very recently but thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed and just as one last sentiment before i go i know that living with rosacea isn't always the easiest thing like i have got such a full coverage foundation on today for some reason i feel like as well i've been eating really healthily i haven't been having it's things like white wine that will really flare up my skin haven't been having that i've been you know putting my spf on i've been really well behaved and for some reason i am ready to be treated today i've been getting loads of sleep like what it's that kind of thing isn't it you feel like you do everything right and some days your skin just completely sabotages you um i've been there a million times you've been there we're gonna have those bad days they will pass you'll figure out what works you'll learn the kinds of things that you can do to calm it down again so please just remember that i know it's something that you're contending with every day but there is so much that you can do to reduce the severity of your symptoms and another thing i'd remind you is that this is a very valid reason to go to the doctor and ask for a bit of extra help rosacea is medical and there are things that you know go beyond the realm of what you will be able to find on the shelf at your local pharmacy so never be afraid to go and have that conversation and maybe that podcast even is a good place to start and just have a listen to how normal these conversations are and how much can be done to help you um but anyway thanks so much for watching if you find anything new as well by the way or even just if you're using something that you love i'd love to hear about it in the comments often things that i find just because someone else has recommended it to me or i love hearing what you're using and enjoying and if there's anything else i need to give a try so um let me know and anyway i'll chat to you soon take care",

        "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to my channel or thanks for clicking on this video um in this week's video i'm going to be doing a rosacea skincare related video um my last one did really well and i got like a lot of comments a lot of likes and like people like actually interact and said that was great so in this video i wanted to um explain what i do to exfoliate my skin because i know that is one of the issues and when you have rosacea they tell you not to use that harsh harsh scrubs because it will basically make your rosacea worse when i first um had like my massive flower rosacea i was like okay but if i can't exfoliate my skin i'm literally gonna have acne because i've got really oily skin so i'm going to be sharing my favorite product with you um and something that has literally been a lifesaver in my rosacea journey and so if you're interested in finding out what the product is um learning a bit more about rosacea then keep watching so i feel like this is going to be quite a short video because once i've told you it's probably there's not going to be much to say but basically this whole video is about my paula's choice anti-redness exfoliating solution i love it um so what this does it actually so it's anti-redness exfoliating solution two percent salic acid is for blemish prone skin it clears break up breakout unclogs pores and visibly reduces redness and this is in regular strength and quite honestly that is exactly what it does so first i'll just sort of explain how it works and how i use it and so basically when you have rosacea they tell you not to use a harsh scrub on your skin before i had my big flare out of rosacea this year i used saint ives um apricot scrub which i literally would i would have taken to the grave with me because it worked so well i have oily skin so i have blackheads and that and you know if i don't clear them out then i will get spots so when i was told i shouldn't be using that i was like a little bit concerned i was like okay well what else am i meant to use um so i did my research and i came across um liquid exfoliants they work exactly the same as scrub exfoliants um except it is a liquid basically so you use it on a cotton pad you soak the compound in it and you wipe all over your face and then you get like this nice tingly feeling and what that tingling feeling is is the um i guess it's like the salad the salic acid and like the active ingredients in here working its way into your pores and literally de-clogging your blackheads and your spots um you can use this one to two times a day um like i said i have it in regular strength so i use it um if my skin's like doing fine and it's not like it's particularly bad i'll use it once a day in the evenings um but if i'm like having quite bad skin like my skin's not the best at the moment um i'll use it two times a day so i'll use it in the morning and in the evening as well the texture is literally like water um but there's one thing to note basically so like i said i have oily skin and i have the regular strength um and i thought when it was getting really bad i thought oh do you know what i'll get the they have an extra strength i was like i'll get the extra strength because that will literally like you know attack my blackheads and like sort my skin out i was like easy fix so the extra strength arrived in the post and they don't explain this to you on the website i don't really understand why it's any different but the extra strength is very oily it's got like an oily substance an oily texture whereas this is literally just feels like water um so i used it a couple of times but i have oily skin like i've just said so it just made me break out even more um but what's great about paulie's choice is that if you do not like any of the products and you've used them a couple of times you can send them back and they will give you a full refund or you can send them back and they will ship out another item like don't exchange basically um so i was really really happy about that like i just sent it back and they gave me my money back and then i brought just the regular choice again so obviously that wasn't too great for me because i had oily skin but um it's probably quite good overall because if you have more on the oily combination side then i would suggest using the um regular strength but if you have more on the dry side then i would actually suggest using the extra strength because of the because of the oils that it has in it it just doesn't make any sense um how they've done how they've done the extra strength for people with dry skin but that is that and it's you know what i also love about this is that they have a little baby size sorry about how cute is that so when i went on holiday i brought a little one of these and it's um so cute because you can just pop it in your bag that means you can take it on holiday with you because this is over the limit i think yeah this will be over the limit but this is under price wise it is a little bit of a test here i believe the big size is 38 but a lot of the time paula's choice have like 10 discount codes on or something like that and then the little size is 9. so 38 9 and that is dollars is it's aud so australian dollars so it would be about 18 pounds i would highly recommend this for people with rosacea's prone skin or just redness because it does actually help reduce the redness as well um acne prone skin oily skin honestly it's one of the best best things that i have discovered on my skincare journey so far i love it so much i don't know if you can tell but i absolutely love it also just one final thing what i do love about it is that you can use it every single day so you're not meant to use harsh scrub exfoliants every day because it strips about the layer of your skin but because this is a liquid exfoliant it's not as harsh it's a little bit more gentle on your skin that's why it's you know good

        "transcript": "hello to say it's been a hot minute is a drastic understatement but what I'm glad to report is that my skin is clear my rosacea people say it's incurable I don't care I never believed it I never wanted to believe it so I kept searching for me it's been since 2016 and it's now 2023. it's about time I would say and in this video I want to share with you uh the things that have really helped me have changed and revolutionized my skin I spent a long time believing that it was difficult to heal and that the more pain I put myself through the stretch of the regimen the more likely it was that I was doing the right thing and that I would get better that was never the case and I've had times where I feel like I've healed and then I've backtracked I got mold poisoning and everything came back even with a Vengeance I became you know having reactions to all types of food when I had made so much progress before and I just thought when is enough enough and it was actually last year in August when I got I was before August it was in June last year when I got covered and I got significantly worse again everything got re-triggered and activated and I was just fed up and you know in those moments where you go nut enough is enough what I'm doing is not working it has gotten me this far it's not getting me any further and you hit this like roadblock and it's so frustrating and you just want to cry and you're overwhelmed I hit that point back in June 2022 and I turned around and went I'm doing it differently so I met this friend through my blog in the raw and I had helped her with her rosacea journey and she came back around and swung back around and helped me with my rosacea Journey now her recommendation to me was to try particular products this is not a sponsored ad I have nothing to do with anything I would never do that um but I'm just going to share with you what worked because I think I owe it to you and I've I've recommended it to multiple different people and the results that they've had has just been amazing uh because it works and all of a sudden what I found in my health Journey was that it went from being super difficult to being very clear this is getting rid of the cause I don't have to like starve myself and worry about everything being just so otherwise I'm going to have this awful reaction which is what it was all of a sudden I'm getting better and better and I can eat I was so happy and it was such a relief because every day my skin is getting consistently better consistently better consistently better and it's just like for the first time it's not get a bit better get a little bit worse get a bit better get a little bit worse and just like this journey of just uncertainty and like is it this is it that enough you know we have to deal with enough things that we shouldn't be having to worry you know constantly about what we eat about changing our pillow every five minutes about worrying about touching our face and just all these like finicky things that we we obsess over when we have such severe issues we think oh if we do all these miniature things like then my skin will be okay as if it's your fault that your skin is not okay that you are doing something fundamentally wrong well sometimes it's about finding the root of how it occurred and allowing yourself to enjoy life and ease into the things that you want to ease into um so this is what these products did for me and oh I should probably show you what they are I didn't organize that very well this is a bit impromptu so the products that I started using were recommended by my friend who also had a severe formal rosacea very similar presentation to mine we have very different Journeys but very similar presentation and I was super skeptical at first I was I it actually she recommended to me nine months earlier and I kept thinking to myself I wish I tried this earlier uh but who cares it was perfect timing that's just the same it was perfect timing so I tie the products I but before I did I start going no like I just nosedive into all of this person's content he was originally a doctor dermatologist who got sick of the fact that the typical way that Dermatology functions the options are laser antibiotics or anti-inflammatories all of which can cause a lot of damage and for many of you I know because I speak to so many people around the world their rosacea got significantly worse after taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatories because it exacerbates the underlying cause now controversial thing to say but I'm going to say it so he started questioning that and started formulating uh and researching to what might work and rosacea is such a complex skin condition it seems to be one of the most difficult skin conditions and the one that doctors seem to believe cannot be eradicated cannot be reversed but I have reversed the vast majority of my allergies before I get to the solution I just want to share with you something so exciting for the past three weeks I have been eating gluten I've been eating all these things that I normally would be like I'm never eating that again it's so bad for you um and just enjoying food and just loving life um so uh and I still listen to my body anyway the point is let's get to the product so I started using and researching and deep diving into a product called as osmosis or a brand called osmosis I began with their rescue serum uh which helped with my dry painful red and flaky skin it was so painful and so red I'll show you before and afters um I mean you can see the after but the befores of when I start before I started using these products it's just crazy like the inflammation not just the redness and the bumps I had like a nose bump like this but also the puffiness of my eyes the swelling of my cheeks like I also had like a double chin um even though I'm the same size so I was just overall really inflamed and swollen and that's because it's autoimmune issues now I thought on the rescue and immediately I felt insane relief like previously I had been putting on so much Derma vigils like just slapping on the lipids just to try and almost like a Vaseline just like trying to cover my um my barrier so that it would not be leaking moisture all the time because it was so itchy and so sore I was applying it multiple times a day I couldn't go anywhere without it I would never ever dream of you know not cleansing my face or going through my routine if I woke up I immediately had to go to the bathroom and wash my face because I was in agony always when I wake up when I go to bed now sometimes I forget to wash my face I actually don't know who I am anymore I'm pretty good though like it's it's not a regular occurrence but that's the level I don't it it's not like an everyday Obsession because it's not painful it's it's livable I mean it's pretty good so okay rescue fantastic product it's a DNA Repair Serum it helps to heal scars does all these things for collagen look it up um I'll probably put some links below uh so that you can have a little bit of a look-see but Dr Ben Johnson has so much so many YouTube videos online I'll tell you all the other things that I also used as well so I started with rescue and I also started with regenerate which was a liver it's meant to help regenerate the liver and help the liver so Dr Ben's theory is that with rosacea it's either liver induced or it's candida introduced and he has things on the website to determine what that is you can also email him uh and I'll put his email down below you can email him personally and he will respond to you um for free so that's really generous um it's getting harder and harder for him to do it within you know a week or so but it's worth it regenerate he told me I needed to go on it for nine months I hit the nine month Mark I think a month ago um and now I'm off all the internal products and my skin stays consistently really good it's improving all the time every month and so regenerate was the second one I also after I started doing the regenerate I was making a lot of progress but I wasn't making it's like I was making progress in some areas of my skin and not in other areas and when I sent some photos to Dr Ben he said you also have candida rosacea so I went on his candida protocol as well as the liver protocol and I started as I was detoxing my skin that's why I started with the rescue because it helps detox as well detox and heal after I started with the rescue I started adding other elements into my regimen but if it was causing the detox to happen too strongly I would pair back and wait I think it took me three months before I could go on some of these other repair serums I went on stem factor which helps with like collagen and scarring and then I also wanted to try Catalyst Ace 11. once you start learning about all these incredible products and what they do for your skin it's like I want to try I want to try but you have to slow down and so I now have implemented I've got stem Factor rescue the um correct serum I started off with calm which is better for rosacea skin you start off with calm and then uh Catalyst ac11 every now and again um and that's really good for elasticity and it's just all of it helps with different things for the skin especially when you're doing repair like I've had almost what seven years of skin damage and breakage to make up for so my skin is loving it the first thing I realized when I put this topical stuff on my skin was oh it's fading my skin my my skin feels fed uh so that was really great and then um yeah so you can look up what his candida protocol is it's um something called uh you take these capsules called clarify it helps you clear out mucus which apparently is what candida different types of candida feeds off and then you take this like spray Elixir thing which helps reduce the population of the candida so I did that for three months and noticed significant effects and then I just continued to improve as I continue to take regenerate and I also took his fat supplement which I forget the name of at this point in time uh that one's really amazing as well I took that for three months because I in the past had really bad I just I just didn't have enough natural oils and lipids in my skin um that's also something that could help aid your skin as well as not having enough oils because I wasn't absorbing it because my liver wasn't functioning properly so I wasn't absorbing fat and I've noticed like I used to have a lot of pulling like my skin was pulling and tight because it didn't have enough lipids and fats and I've done you know a lot of skin scans now and the pulling is no longer there so my skin is now like having this vibrant lipid look the youthful look or whatever I know I'm younger whatever I did have like all these what appeared to be like all these Fine Lines because my skin was so dry I would highly recommend giving it a go emailing Dr Ben again this isn't sponsored but I just wanted to give you guys an update because I want more people to know about what works and at the end of the day it's all about having a better relationship with your body learning to love yourself more and living the most vibrant life you can so you can start giving to others one of the things that I struggle with the most and I think we do struggle with in self-esteem when your skin severely affects your life especially with more severe skin conditions or ones that are autoimmune related they really significantly can impact your life and it impacts your ability to contribute to the world to actualize yourself to Greater to Greater degrees it might affect travel it might affect the activities you participate in it may affect the you know the confidence level of you to be able to make contacts and friends and further yourself and your career it might reduce your ability to earn and therefore give back to society maybe you want to make more contributions to Charities causes all these things like it affects every area of your life and people don't realize the significant impact and so that's why I'm sharing this with you because I feel like the past nine months of my life 10 months I think it's 10 or 11 months now I can't even count anymore I've just lost track have been transformed because of this so let me know how you go let me know your thoughts let me know if you've tried it before and yeah I would love to see how it helps you and if you tried it as a result of watching this video anyway lots of love to you and um good luck on your skin Journey",

        "transcript": "hi guys this is not only the latest that I've ever filmed a video um I've also never really been this unpresented before a video where I'm going to be talking about my skin my Skin's not looking great but trust me it's actually quite good at the moment it used to be a lot worse um but yes in this video I'm going to be talking about my updated skincare like what's been working for me and I'm also gonna have a quick chat about the whole laser situation because I've been getting a lot of comments on my old videos where I was talking about my laser and I just thought I would thought I would address some of those questions in this video so we'll get started with what I'm currently using um because I haven't posted like a skin care um like what I'm using for over well over a year now I must be um and the videos I used to post were what I was what products I was using for my rosacea and for my perier or dermatitis which I suffered with um and yeah some of them have changed some of them no longer work for me and I found some new ones that now do work for me so let's get into it my silicone is in water I use every day to take off my makeup um whether I am wearing makeup or not wearing it I will use it to take either just my makeup off or just cleanse my face after micellar water I use the CeraVe sa smoothing cleanser I have been using this for about maybe five months four or five months um and I am using this in replacement of my Paula's Choice um aha solution um I used to use that a lot I had some great results with it I did a whole video on it and I really would recommend people trying it if you're trying to find a way use a product that has salic acid in it to break down like clogged pores but unfortunately you know your your skin changes over time and mine just didn't like it anymore it was just a bit too I kind of saw it stop working like I feel like I started to get black blackheads and stuff and before I didn't so anyway I scrapped that and I introduced a cleanser with salic acid in it so I still have salic acid in my routine this this next step is a bit weird I then put this on my face which is nice oral two percent anti-tandruff shampoo what I do with this is I like Pat my face dry after cleansing it and then I will put this on my forehead and like my chin line and leave it for five minutes and then wash it off um this is for treatment of fungal acne um if you have ever had fungal acne you can get it for a bunch of different reasons you can get it from or like excessive oil excessive sweating I think you can get it from um you can get it from like uh I think it's like clogged hair follicles or something you can also get it from having um antibiotics very regularly as they mess up your whole bacteria levels basically I take a lot of antibiotics um for another issue in itself and so then once I wash that off obviously I put my face dry and then I go on my skincare on the dry side of things first off I don't have it with me but I'm still using the metronidazole gel um I honestly think the one I'm using is our update now because I stopped using it for ages and then I've started using it again because I noticed that I was getting like quite inflamed spots and that is a treatment the metronidazole or whatever is a treatment for rosacea and I found that it um it helps with the information side of things and it does help my skin I think it helps so I'm just using it um after that I use the Vichy 90 89 sorry booster which is a hyaluronic which is a hydrating hyaluronic acid serum um I've only been using this for about two months now but I've been absolutely loving it it's basically just super super hydrating um hyaluronic acid is really good for your skin um and yeah I haven't had any bad reactions to it I think it's helping my skin feel a lot smoother and a lot plumper so I am really enjoying it and the bottle is beautiful beautiful it's glass it's a blue and white ombre I'm obsessed uh so after that comes the big game changer um as you may know if you've watched any of my past videos and my video on perier oral dermatitis the reason that I developed dermatitis and it was really really bad I'll see if I have any photos and put them here it was all over my eyelids all over like my um my nose and my my lips like around the sides it was during lockdown thankfully but it was bad and it was because I was putting too many um strong products on my face and to top it off I started using the ordinary retinol a serum um and that was just like boom my face was like nope at that point I think I was using azaleic acid salic acid retinol a niama side and zinc like I was just using a lot and now I've sort of like cut back like on the other side of things I'm only using salic acid in my cleanser hyaluronic acid is pretty gentle so I'm fine with that and then this is what I'm using for my retinol which I've only started using Nat recently it's the CeraVe retinol resurfacing serum what I like about this product is that it has a small like a very very small amount of retinol a in it so small in fact that it is so far down the ingredients list um it's like nothing to be concerned about the other ones the other like ones I've tried are really really strong really potent and my skin just obviously couldn't handle it so I started off using this about four to six weeks ago I'd say um no actually way longer than that because it's almost empty maybe two months plus actually um and I used it every other day and now I use it every day and I love it it has helped my skin so much on the acne side of things I put it across my four oh I mean I put it everywhere but I have actually started to develop a tiny tiny little rash however I'm on top of it like because I know what happened last time and I know the things that helped my perioral dermatitis last time um so I'm treating I'm treating it and I think I'm on top of it and I'm just avoiding putting the retinol in those sensitive areas so I'm doing again my forehead my jawline and then like just like the sides of my cheeks and not I might like my nose but basically like not like the Triangular area under my eyes and not like around my nose the retinol is great obviously because it helps your um so it increases your cellular turnover it's quite good for rosacea as well but most importantly um I would say the effects that I've seen are on the acne side of things it's very drying which is probably why it helps my skin because I have very oily skin so after I use this I then go in with a moisturizer which is just that no no children you know neutral Junior nitrogena oh my God why can't I say it the Hydro Boost gel um this is I think I'm almost out to be fair I just use a tiny little bit and I just put it all over my face um you can use anything I like this one because I think it's oil free so it's really good for oily skin obviously I got a question the other day um on my perioral dermatitis and said what do you suggest using around the eye area and since using my retinol I have been getting really really dry under under my eyes even though I am actively avoiding putting it in that area I don't know why it's just happening unless it may be the hyaluronic acid but how I counteract that is by using this which I've spoken about before the evinae um restorative protective cream I'm sure if you've watched any videos on um eczema or perioral dermatitis you'll know what this is so after I've done all of that I then put like a tiny bit on my fingers and I just go like underneath and then I also put it here which is where that little like rashy bit is coming up and that's been keeping that like great like very much under control and it's massively reducing it and then once a week I will then use my larochet um D plug-in mask or whatever because I find that even though all of that is great for my skin or is helping my skin anyway um it sounds like loads of stuff that I'm using but it doesn't really seem that much um but anyway sorry I'm still finding that I have like clogged pores and blackheads because I'm not using an exfoliator now technically I know that the retina is a little bit exfoliating but still um and I love this I've been using it for about five weeks six weeks once a week for that length of time and I find that it just pulls out all the gunk basically and helps completely decock my pores so that is me for the skin care that I've been using for someone who has suffered with perior dermatitis eczema um rosacea sensitive skin all of it all of the above and this is currently working for me are plus one other thing all right which isn't even anything to do with this video I did a completely separate video on it itself but it's honestly I'm loving it so much I feel like I have to mention it and I got gifted this but I absolutely love it it's the current body mask it's the LED face mask it has reduced my redness for my rosacea so much the next morning after I use it I can tell when I've used it like my skin is like non-red and it's plump and it looks hydrated and I love it I absolutely love it um I'm really really grateful that I got the opportunity to work with that brand um because yeah I'm a big advocate for it now so you know if that was marketing done right because I am a big fan now um so laser wise um I have had like three sessions I think in the last six months of the laser that goes all over your face I have one more session page for and I I'm like Ugh annoyed really because I don't think it's making a difference I've done two videos I've done videos doing the whole facial flushing and whether that's worked and then I've also done a video on the spider vein which is specific laser on like your capillaries and broken capillaries um so this facial flushing laser I don't know if that's stopped working for me if I'm not getting it done enough for to for it to make a difference but I've sort of stopped that now I will use my last one um obviously because I paid for it but after that I probably won't do it again um but in a recent video that I posted I got a question about my laser um for my my broken capillary on my face I don't know if I have any photos if I do I'll post it here because it was really bad um and I got yeah laser therapy for it I had the laser therapy for a for probably a total of like nine months and then it was like basically complete no it was completely gone during those nine months they did it didn't just go after one session like it would get lasered and then it would look better but still be there and still be like red and then it would I'd go again and it would be a little bit less red and I almost feel like I plateaued a bit at the like the six month Mark um so I actually switched laser clinics and then in the last three months it was like boom they got rid of it completely um so that I 100 recommend because that was like a lifesaver for me because my broken capillary on my nose was so bad it literally looked like an open wound it was awful so if you are getting the treatment and you've started to see like some changes but you're worried that it's not gone completely don't worry it's a process like it takes a few months um it's not going to go in one session so yeah I'm seeing the time and it's 17 minutes I've been talking for 17 minutes that is it I'm really sorry I've been rambling I feel like this video hasn't been helpful at all I've just been talking at you but I wanted to give you an update of what I'm using what's currently working for me um and just like an update on the laser thing because I've been having a lot of traction on that so thank you for watching I hope it's been helpful let me know if you have any questions down below um if you have like rosacea let me know any other products that you'd recommend I'm pretty good with my routine at the moment and I'm scared to introducing the thing else but I love doing research and research in the background so please share thanks for watching and I'll see you next week's video bye",

        "transcript": "let's build a skincare routine for rosacea skin in the morning start off with an optional cleanse follow that up with an over-the-counter or prescription strength AOL like acid next step is a vitamin C I like THD ascorbate based ones for rosacea sensitive skin follow that up with sunscreen we know that UV flares rosacea so it's really important to use a sunscreen and mineral sunscreens are less likely to irritate your sensitive rosacea skin in the evening start off with a cleanse you can use your double cleanse if use a gentle retinoid I prefer the skin better alphar rette if you're dry you can use a soothing serum like the skin ptical phyto corrective with soothing Botanical as well as hyaluronic acid last step choose a moisturizer bonus points if it has soothing ingredients like cantella",

        "transcript": "hi my name is Marsha and today I'm glowing as most of you know if you've seen my videos before I have been on a health journey to improve my overall health and with that comes self-care self-care refers to everything taking care of of your body your mind your spirit everything and that includes your skin so if you guys have been watching any of my videos from the beginning one of my first appointments with my doctor you know my cat is rubbing on the tripod one of the first appointments I had with my doctor I was diagnosed with rosacea it was one of the many things that I was diagnosed with and rosacea on my face I have I've always had lots of redness I'm gonna zoom you in a little bit here because if you look I do have makeup on but if you look like right here you can actually see some of the blood vessels that are really close to the surface of my skin and I do still have some little blemishes however it's significantly different than what it used to be one of the things I was prescribed for my rosacea was this and metronidazole gel 1% I tried using this for a week or two and honestly it was just so painful to use I would put it on and it felt like I was putting like an acid scrub on my face I mentioned it to my doctor and he suggested that I keep going with it that the more I use it the my skin would you know get better I just I couldn't do it so I stopped using it what I did do is I really started concentrating on washing my face with cleaners too that are good for really sensitive skin I'm my skin is so sensitive that I'm allergic to almost every single sunblock I'm allergic to the Sun and with the rosacea and everything I always had red red blotchiness and some blemishes and stuff and it was so bad that for a couple years I didn't wear any makeup because it was just making it that much worse so I kind of suffered through and said this is as good as it's gonna get so I'm gonna show you guys what my evening skincare routine is I've been wearing makeup all day so I'm going to show you what I use to remove the makeup and the products that I use as far as moisturizers and stuff like that so let's go to the bathroom [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I don't tell dry my face once i rinsed off the cleaners but let me show you my skin no there's a little bit of redness still as I mentioned I do have a little blemish there right there is one of those broken capillaries there's some more right through here where you can actually see the the blood vessels that are really close to the surface of my skin so now that my face is clean I use this Juice Beauty brightening eye cream to moisturize I don't necessarily think that you need I cream I think lotion in general it's certainly better than what I was doing before because I wasn't really taking care of my skin I was I was actually afraid to put anything on it so I avoided a lot of that stuff and then I use a green apple this is actually labeled as a body moisturizer but as I mentioned to me a moisturizer as a moisturizer and if it works for your skin then you should use it my skin is so sensitive that whatever I can put on it that doesn't make my skin freak out so I put a blob of it on my hands rub that in get down my neck and on to my chest and then I just rub the rest into my arms I also had other things like on my forearms I had what's called chicken skin it's where you have extra cop I think it's collagen that kind of gets in your skin and it actually makes your skin feel like you have chicken skin I was like like those little permanent goosebumps so to speak so I started doing some dry brushing and I helped to exfoliate all that skin and the build-up of sebum or whatever and this is what I do and there's a couple of channels that I watch all the time on YouTube I really like their content one of them is skin care by Hiram he's not a dermatologist or an esthetician but he's got a ton of information on different products and things that can help people with sensitive skin I don't know if he's ever mentioned Juice Beauty he does some of the things I've been using I actually got the ideas from his channel and then there's also James Welsh and he also has a skincare channel where he goes over hair and skin and just both of those channels have been some of the favorite ones I've been watching to help come up with a skincare routine that has really helped to improve my skin yeah I'm gonna put in some pictures throughout this video I'll show you what my skin looked like before and how it looks now again I don't have any bumps or like I used to have patches of like pimply type texture on my skin typical rosacea stuff but like I said it was so bad that I didn't want to put anything on especially makeup and stuff like that and now all of that texture and stuff is completely gone my skin is smoother there is still some redness when I'm not wearing makeup my blood blood vessels are so close to my skin that are to the top layer of my skin that I don't think that's ever gonna go away from me and I'm okay with that but in all honesty in my opinion the number one thing that has really helped my skin because rosacea is actually an inflammation in the body so when I did an elimination diet and I figured out the foods that affect my body that caused inflammation within my body once I started eliminating those foods my skin saw drastic improvement and that was the the biggest things I've eliminated from my diet is dairy products and breads so all forms of gluten those are the the main culprits that cause problems for me I've always been lactose intolerant I was born with a lactose intolerance so it's it was a big problem and it made my skin so much worse but now like I said earlier I am glowing and I'm loving it my skin feels good and I love wearing the makeup as I showed in I think I mentioned it in my last video so if you guys are new here please please feel free to subscribe I would love to have you guys back if you guys are already a subscriber I appreciate you so much and I love you that you keep coming back to watch and support my journey and I look forward to seeing you guys in the next one have a great day [Music]",
