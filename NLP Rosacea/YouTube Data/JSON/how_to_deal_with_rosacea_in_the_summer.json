        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as well thank you so much for watching don't forget to like this video And subscribe to the channel and I'll see you next time foreign",

        "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be doing my summer skin essentials for sensitive rosacea skin I don't have that many of them because I mean let's be real when you have sensitive skin rosacea skin your skin is very selective on what it likes but I just want to come on camera because I do have some items that I feel like I need to share with you guys I do have a playlist on my youtube channel that has all of my rosacea content in one spot you guys can just binge watch all of it I think the last time I did a video was maybe in January or February one of those two months and I just briefly talked about some of my favorite items and I am still 100% obsessed with those items they are awesome same thing with my other one I think it was in December that I filmed that video and I talked about like my must-have products for rosacea skin still I'm a huge fan of all those products uses products pretty much every single day so I always like to quickly say that I like to film these videos without any makeup on well I am wearing lipstick but you guys know like I'm not wearing any foundation or any like tinted moisturizer this is like my natural skin I like to do this you guys can see my skin for what it is it's just also kind of for you guys to know that if you are in a place where your rosacea is really really bad it's going to get better I promise you have faith have hope I was once that person that was literally on a couch just like I give up that looks like I look like I don't want them to see me like I know all those feelings so when you guys tell me that you guys have those feelings I can completely relate so I'm gonna go ahead and start off with the face cleansers and that I would recommend and I actually have a drugstore one and I have one that little bit more pricier because I know we're all on a budget sometimes so some of you guys may prefer drugstore over a little bit high-end so I'm gonna start off with the one that I have used when my skin was the worst of the worst and that is the pure skin face cleanser by first aid beauty now I mentioned firstly Beauty all the time in my skin videos or whenever I talk about my rosacea journey first day beauty was one of the only very very few brands that was there for my rosacea when they was at its worst when I literally couldn't put anything on my skin without it like literally feeling really irritate a removes dirt it removes oils or whose a makeup all that it's safe for sensitive skin is allergy tested it is fragrance free and it truly does not have a scent everyone I first are using it was like oh my god this is so boring it doesn't have a scent like I need something that can smell pretty but you don't need all that like you can smell flowers in a garden for your face you really want to try to keep the scent as minimal as possible especially when you do have rosacea sensitive skin so this is just very very self-explanatory you put it on your face when you're washing it it cleanses it it doesn't dry out the skin it just leaves it feeling really nice and you know clean so I really do recommend this one I actually just repurchased another one because I'm like I need this you know to keep me attacked and find them on their website or at Ulta comm Sephora calm they have it pretty much everywhere now but I'm a huge believer a first DVD because this is one of the skincare brands that was there for me when I really needed the support for my rosacea so this is a great cleanser now moving on to the drugstore cleanser that I've been using this is the one that I've been using pretty much every day a lot of you guys actually have been asking me like do you have a good drugstore cleanser for a murse a shoe skin and I was like I'm trying one but I don't want to talk about until I know that I've used it enough for me to be able to either say it's good or it's bad and this is the set of fit so you guys know Cetaphil I feel like it's very self-explanatory use all China in the drugstore Cetaphil is mainly recommended a lot by dermatologists they'll be like oh go get some set of failed products like they're really soothing and they're really sensitive friendly for skin and so I had tried like the regular Cetaphil face cleanser and to be honest I wasn't like obsessed with it like it wasn't anything spectacular for me so I kind of just let that one go but then when I went to Cetaphil I want to say like two months ago I saw they had this redness prone skin foaming face wash and I was like hmm Brighton is prone skin that sounds like something for me so I was like let me give this a go so I decided to try it and I have been really enjoying this stuff I used this at night in the morning I have one of these guys one of the first day Beauty cleansers in my bathroom shower I typically shower every morning because I go to the gym every morning so after I come home and I shower and I just used that one that's already in my shower and then at night at my sink I have this one so I use this one mainly at night I'm not saying this is only for a night I'm just saying that's how my routine goes and also because I'm lazy to have to move my cleanser from the shower to the sink I know that sounds so like diva licious but like I'm sorry I just I have to cleansers to situations like so this one I like to use it at night especially because I feel like with that filming consistency it really does allow to get off all the makeup all the junk off of the face and make it feel really good I also love the fact that with this cleanser it does not dry out my skin and I think that's a big part of it chews because sometimes I've noticed that with my rosacea it can get dried out in the cheek area after I like strip it clean and I feel like with this one it doesn't do that I also like the fact that this is a foaming consistency because I feel like with the film a consistency is that it allows it to like lather on more gently onto the skin and also cover more ground you need less product and it just gets rid of everything that needs to get rid of so I really do appreciate this Cetaphil foaming face wash like I mentioned this is the redness prone skin one and I also like it because I feel like it really does leave my skin feeling hydrated so after I wash it feels hydrated I can go like a good 20 minutes before I apply like my night and all that stuff and it's not gonna start to feel like it's like cracking or super dry like it moisturize me like it just it feels good so like if I were to forget to apply my night cream for some reason this would be still good on its own but for me I feel like cleansers are very important when you do have rosacea because I feel like cleansers are probably the main thing that makes a difference I feel like for me when it comes to rosacea skin what I would recommend anybody with rosacea skin to get is a face cleanser a moisturizer and sunscreen that's pretty much all you need especially when your skin is really really bad and struggling you don't need anything more than that and I feel like when people start to add too much stuff to their skincare that's when things start to just get bad or get flare-ups and I feel like if you already got those three things linked down to the tea and they're really working for you then you can go ahead and add an exfoliator or you can go ahead and add a toner of serum that's how I went about it and I do have those extra steps but I know that if I were to take out those extra steps that would be just good with these three steps so now that I mentioned that I'm gonna move into a product that was an extra step that I've added but that I know a lot of people consistently ask me about this is the Cetaphil extra gentle daily scrub so this is kind of like the exfoliator I don't use this daily because I don't think that telling you the rosacea should use an exfoliator daily I use this probably once or twice a week if I do wear a lot a lot of makeup and I feel like I need to like do that extra cleanse but it is very very gentle definitely for somebody that wants to like really exploit wants it to be like super like beady and stuff and like really scrub your face this is gonna be way too gentle for you this is for people that are just dipping their toes in the water into an exfoliator want something super duper gentle that's not gonna irritate or not gonna like make their face look really rad this is the way to go this is actually my second bottle of this so I can really vouch that I really do love this product because I repurchased it it's not irritating it just makes my skin look really good and I really forget it in the areas where I feel like I need that extra scrub so I don't really go too harsh around the cheeks where the rosacea is I kind of like leave that a little bit more alone but I just hit the areas where like I feel like I put on a lot of makeup and it doesn't irritate anything else okay so now we're gonna move into to complete essentials so the first one I want to talk about is the first aid beauty weightless liquid mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide SPF 30 this is an absolute must if you do not have this you need to go buy it right now stop this video and go buy it I've been on the hunt for my perfect sunscreen for a very long time this sunscreen changed the game for me this is first a baby sunscreen absolutely amazing with the zinc oxide in there it has that 30 SPF it really protects me through the day I also love the fact that this sunscreen is tinted a little bit and so with that little tint that it has I feel like it really allows to kind of even out my skin a little bit further so on the days where I am not wearing makeup and let's say I just have a bare face and I just want to look a little bit more put together just putting on my sunscreen does a trick for me so it makes me not even want to put on any type of tinted moisturizer or anything like that and because I also do have lash extensions which are such a blessing I can literally just put on my sunscreen and with that little tint that it gives me it really does a good job of slightly minimizing certain little areas of the redness and it makes it look a little bit more evened out and I'm actually wearing sunscreen right now because I am a sunscreen addict like this is like my life so I really do go in with a good amount of this if you guys did watch my last video which is my summer foundation routine I mentioned that product and I show you guys how much I put on my face and how it makes a really big difference for me this product has not irritated me at all I've had such good experiences with this I am so happy that I finally found a sunscreen that works with my rosacea so if you're looking for scream and you do have rosacea steam or sensitive skin I would highly look into this sunscreen if I first abd do a little bit further investigation on your own but a lot of people I've seen talk about this product really really do enjoy it one thing I do want to note is that when you do use this make sure that you really shake the product but you really get the product to disperse out I also really love this because it's very lightweight on the skin it doesn't smell like sunscreen either I hate those sunscreens that smell intensely like sunscreen this does not do that at all and it just it sinks in no white cast looks absolutely great and is worth your money for sure and the last one is another sunscreen this is by seriously fab this is a zinc it over sunscreen 25 SPF and most of you guys when they come for me girl 25 SPF ain't nothing but guess what this is more so for my retouching a sunscreen so typically on days where I'm just wearing sunscreen I'll put on the sunscreen in the beginning of the day then through the day like every two to three hours I'll go in with my seriously fab zinc it over and I will retouch always recommend you guys shake this if you guys don't shake this you may get little white dots on your face and the white dots is just the sunscreen product we we just we there's nothing you can do about it but just make sure you're always shaking it this one is in the fresh greens and they also have another one which I was mainly using all last summer because my skin was very very sensitive for some reason last summer and the unscented one was great dim irritate me whatsoever right now I'm wearing the fresh creams which I just mentioned just have a little bit of a scent but it doesn't irritate me at all like it works great so I highly recommend this to retouch your sunscreen through the day I've had no issues with it whatsoever I feel like it just does a good job of refreshing my face especially if I am wearing like foundation and stuff this is great because it'll make sure that it doesn't interfere with the foundation but I just feel like it's very important to apply that sunscreen but then to continue retouching it and if you can't retouch it by applying the liquid because you have a foundation or something or because you just don't have it with you you can always carry a little spray they also have many versions of this which is great for your purse but I carry this in my purse anyway something like I need it I really need this product in there so those pretty much are all my summer

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "hi I'm Dr Sam Bunting and today I'm going to be giving you my five simple skin care cheats to help manage your [Music] rosacea now if you have rosacea that means you're prone to red bumpy skin that flushes at the job of a hat so if you've gotten off the tube of the bus this morning the chances are you're a bit hot flustered and your face is tingling and you know that your cheeks and nose are reminiscent of Santa now you've probably tried lots of creams you've probably even tried color corrective makeup with that greenish tint and found all to be a bit lacking in terms of managing racea it's probably fair to say that the best way forward is using prescription skin care products and possibly even oral medication but I think the bit that's often missed is the importance of your support products and what background kind of backup kit you have access to to help manage your skin especially at a difficult time of year like summer so let's get down to it step one cleanse with Care Now 82% of patients with racea complain of skin sensitivity so pretty much everyone and no doubt this is due to a defect in barrier function that it's often forgotten about when we talk about racea so that means that every time someone cleanses their skin with the wrong product it leaves them stingy they complain of burning and their skin is uncomfortable so I think the way to go about cleansing is to seek out something that's gentle non- foaming and nonf fragrant so skip anything harsh foaming that leaves your skin tight for product suggestions please check the description box below for some great ideas step two ditch counterproductive habits now in the first instance this means physical exfoliation so pretty much anything in involving a cloth a brush or a product with grittiness physical exfoliation is not the friend of those with racea secondly skip any sort of astringent toners so toners that contain alcohol or witch hazel as these are irritants and will add nothing to your skin care regime the one exception is uh the group of patients with Rosia who might also have acne and significantly oily skin so really March shine and prominence of the pores in the T-Zone in which case a toner like product that contains salicylic acid at 1 to 2% may be helpful step three moisturize but don't antagonize now patients with rosacea as I said often have a tendency to acne too and the combination of these two conditions can make them very fearful of using moisturizer for fear of making matters worse but I think moisturizer is key especially because we know that patients with rosacea are prone to dryness because of this barrier defect so I think it's important to use moisturizer but it's also important to have some flexibility in the moisturizer that you use so I often talk to patients about having a good day Moisturizer in a bad days moisturizer so something lighter for when their skin is normal to oily and something richer for nighttime and the other aspect of this is it also improves their tolerance of things that we might use on prescription which might otherwise irritate in the first instance it's usually best to seek out water-based moisturizers rather than oilbased products and again French Pharmacy bands tend to win in this department so something light for oilier days and something richer as a sort of a soothing agent when your skin is more active are great uh components to have in your skin care wardrobe step four don't skimp on UV protection now we know that there's no doubt that UV is a big part of what dries rosacea and certainly patients talk about flareups in summer after UV exposure so building sunscreen into your day-to-day routine is vital and I'm a fan of physical filter based sunscreens in racea prone skin they tend to be less irritating and they tend to give broader UVA protection especially at the longer end of the wavelength of UVA so I seek out products that contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide and I think that the new elegantly formulated tinted sunscreens are a great option in rosacea sufferers the key to making at work as part of your skin care routine is to apply it over moisturizer where it's needed and to allow layers to build carefully and slowly so that everything dries and creates a smooth surface and that way when you apply makeup you don't tend to get those little Annoying white balls peeling off which kind of ruins everything so for some product suggestions again please look in the description box below step five avoid heavy Cosmetics that require a Brill pad to remove coming back to our point about skipping physical exfoliation so I think that skin no matter what the problem always looks best with light coverage all over and careful judicious use of High coverage products just where they're needed so it avoids the idea that there's something lurking beneath you know we've all had those instances where you've had a steak come covered in sauce and you're just not quite sure what's underneath the same is true of makeup so keep it light all over build coverage where you need it use a product that's low for irritancy and fragrance and use a beauty blender again to create a light seamless coverage of product all over and then use something like Nars radiant creamy concealer or vich Derma blend liquid foundation to create coverage just where you need it and in racea sufferers it's typically in the middle of the face over the nose cheeks and sometimes chin you using a light product means you're not scrubbing to get it off at the end of the day um and again if you combine with a tinted sunscreen underneath you'll find that you need less product anyway so those are my five skincare cheats for managing racea I hope you've enjoyed this video and if you have please remember to subscribe and I look forward to seeing you next time bye [Music]",

        "channel_title": "Dr Sam Bunting",
        "description": "One of the biggest triggers for redness is using the wrong skincare - something I imagine every rosacea sufferer knows (myself ...",
        "published_at": "2023-03-30T13:00:19Z",
        "transcript": "now if there's one thing I know about it's redness and a tendency to rosacea and I have learned that the most important thing are my daily habits when it comes to managing my skin now any redness or rosacea sufferer will know that the wrong skin care habits can really be one of the biggest triggers around and that's why it's so important to put together the right supportive skin care routine with the right actives to manage your skin I truly believe that azelaic acid takes pride of place when building an effective redness solution skin care plan so azelic acid is brilliant in redness prone skin and rosacea because it changes the way the skin senses the environment so part of the issue with rosacea is that we overreact to things like UV exposure and harsh winds so I've always likened it to the fire alarm in the kitchen going off when the kettle boils rather than when the oven is on fire the same thing is true for our skin in rosacea now that's because of something called toll-like receptors and the dial is turned right up so these are over sensitive and they overreact leading to things like vasodilatation so the blood vessels in the skin open up changes in Skin Barrier function flushing and then blemishes so papules and pustules now the great thing about azelaic acid it turns the dial right down products that I recommend that contain azelic acid include the inculus 10 percent acetic acid serum the ordinary is the original 10 azoic acid suspension and Flawless brightly serum which has also got 10 azelic acid in combination with three other actives the next active ingredient I think is worth considering is niacinamide now this barrier loving B vitamin is an asset for two reasons firstly it does make the Skin Barrier that bit stronger and more resilient and we know that decreased barrier function is part of the reason why rosacea prone skin behaves so sensitively so that's because of increased ceramide production bolstering your Skin's barrier function and then secondly it's anti-inflammatory and we know triggers in down of why niacinamide is so helpful I think many of us saw this at first hand during the pandemic when wearing masks not only aggravated acne but also tended to aggravate rosacea and niacinamide was a real hero ingredient in that context now products that contain niacinamide include the garden of wisdom's five percent niacinamide serum or as I mentioned Flawless brightly serum also contains niacinamide with azureic acid for ease now the next ingredient I want you to think about for treating redness prone skin might not seem like an active but to me it is and that's physical sunscreen I have patients genuinely appreciate the value of mineral sunscreen and actually improving their rosacea and redness you know are separate to the benefits that they achieve from their actives and I think it's that important because at the end of the day most of the people affected by rosacea tend to have light skin and light eyes and we know they're at risk of premature aging and possibly uncontrolled inflammation might accelerate that so we want to protect the dermis as much as possible so daily sunscreen is a non-negotiable the other thing is that physical sunscreen can often just make the skin look better it has light reflecting properties and if tinted can really give a nice evening out of the skin tone which on good skin days can often mean you can get away with just using concealer personally I cannot live without a lightly tinted sunscreen I'm a Flawless gossamer tint one addict as many of you will know but finding that minerals sunscreen that makes you feel confident even on a day when your Skin's a little on the pink side is a real godsend now introducing a retinoid into redness prone skin or indeed rosacea can seem risky idea after all they're associated with irritation and potentially dryness and scaling however when redness prone skin is calm or your rosaceous in the maintenance phase they actually have quite a lot to offer so firstly they may actually improve the tendency for abnormal red blood vessels to appear so the development of those fixed broken capillaries that we associate with redness prone skin secondly they have a role in re-densifying the dermis so after all we know that those with light skin and light eyes are more at risk of rosacea they're also more at risk of premature aging and we really want all that collagen and elastin hyaluronic acid the structure of proteins that make the skin thick firm and resilient so I'm a big fan of retinoids introduced in the right way at the right time and in the over-the-counter space I think when acts of retinoid has to be one of the best ways to do this in a gentle and reassuring fashion products you can try include the inky list Gran active retinoid the skin rocks retinoid one or Flawless nightly serum if you want to try your retinoid in combination with azelaic acid and niacinamide one more skin care consideration for you is Ivermectin now this is available on prescription hence I'm mentioning it last but it is something to think about if you are getting frequent flare-ups with papules and pustules and redness now in rosacea redness comes about for a number of reasons firstly those broken capillaries can lead to a permanent redness in the cheeks typically but also in the nose and the chin now the blemishes of rosacea can also leave redness behind so post-inflammatory pigmentation can create redness on the skin so as a separate way in which the skin can Redden and then the Third Way is simply through barrier just function that can lend itself to the skin becoming irritating now for me azaleaic acid is excellent at down down the inflammation making the skin look less pink and then Ivermectin or cilantro as it's known on prescription helps to reduce the incidence of those papules in pustules so it is really helpful for an inflammatory flare-up of your rosacea now I tend to use cilantro for inflammatory bursts and then I will plan to wean someone off that onto azulaic acid for maintenance and then I'll just reuse it as often as is needed to help the patient control their flares the good thing about ongoing use of azulaic acid is that over time I find that you get fewer and fewer flare-ups and you get better and better control and in addition to that you also get the nice skin conditioning benefits you get improved texture you get better looking pores and an overall brighter appearance to the skin whilst also helping them achieve the best possible complexion they can so as I've discovered it is really worthwhile having a long-term plan when it comes to a Rosy complexion because unfortunately it does tend to hang around as a tendency however putting in the right groundwork using the right products can lend themselves to improving your skin immeasurably whilst also controlling your redness so it's work that's worthwhile and I hope you find the recommendations in today's video is helpful so if I've convinced you that azaleaic acid is right for you might want to watch My ultimate beginner's guide to using azaleaic acid to give you a foolproof plan for getting started I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you again soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "are you one of the ten percent who's prone to a long blush or even a flush or are you getting spots here that are different to acne type spots or maybe you're someone who's got skin that just looks red all the time and it's super sensitive especially to skin care well you might have rosacea now april is rosacea awareness month so today i wanted to go deep in this common and distressing condition so you have all the information you need to determine if you've got it how to treat it how to choose skin care and what not to do now i'm speaking as somebody who's prone to rosacea myself it kicked in around the age of 30. i suddenly noticed that a glass of red wine my favorite made me redder for longer than all my friends i don't want any photographs taken after a certain time in the evening um i didn't really tend to get spottiness as such and i was definitely sensitive to ill-chosen skin care choices um so i would have to be very careful about what i used on my skin um so if any of that resonates with you then do keep watching because we're going to go into this in a bit more detail but the good news is there's loads that can be done with the right choices of skin care with finding the right treatment to manage your type of rosacea but the key in the first instance is to know what kind of rosacea you have so let's get into that so there are four different types of rosacea now the one that we all know commonly i think is the papulo pustulotype which is often mislabeled as acne rosacea because of the presence of spots red bumps and red bumps with white heads of papules and pustules but there are some key differences to distinguish rosacea from acne the time acne is really a misnomer so the key thing really is that there are no comedones as part of the rosacea process now what can be confusing is that people rosacea can sometimes be also prone to acne but the distribution tends to be different so typically with rosacea we're talking about mid-face disease and the spots themselves have a different quality they're what we call dome shape so the tops are rounded where acne spots tend to be more prone to pointing so that's really key so no comedones and any sort of different shape lesions in a different distribution adult acne is typically in the u of the face teen acne in the t zone so that's type 2 rosacea now type 1 is what we call erythema telangiectatic rosacea so that's a bit of a mouthful but basically it means redness and broken vessels so that's someone who probably doesn't get the spotty aspect but it's just constantly a bit red on the cheeks or the nose and when you peer closely we'll have little broken vessels broken capillaries and they have this pronounced flushing then the third type is phymatus rosacea where basically the ongoing inflammatory process activates fibrosis and thickening of the skin and that's typically seen over the nose something we call rhinophyma now it's rare and it's more common in men but it is an important type to recognize we want to really prevent that type of rosacea and then the final type is ocular rosacea so rosacea's disorder that can affect the eyes and the eyelids so you tend to see reddening and injection along the lid margins and it can occur with conditions like blepharitis as well but someone will typically describe their eyes as being dry gritty um a feeling of discomfort and that's a common manifestation of rosacea it's one that's often missed now one of the hallmarks of rosacea aside from those physical findings is the description of discomfort of the skin so burning and stinging especially in association with skin care and we know that people with rosacea are prone to barrier dysfunction so this is something that practically can really cause problems difficulty using skin care products finding a suitable sunscreen everything burning or stinging when applied to the skin now that is a big and common trigger especially for women but additional triggers exist as well and it really is important to get to know your rosacea and know what your triggers are for some people winter cold weather low humidity will be a real aggravate um we know we've already got barrier dysfunction but that low humidity cold air chafing with winds and things can really make the skin even drier and more sensitive on the other hand there's a group where sunshine and uv is a big part of it and we know that uv is probably a big part in the whole ideology of rosacea it tends to happen in fair-skinned individuals as we said but summer can be particularly troublesome and you factor in sunscreen problems it can often get really quite stressful as i mentioned before what you consume can have a big impact so for me as i said red wine and that's common because red wine not only um is a vasodilator from the point of view of having alcohol in it but it's also histamine releasing which can be a double whammy for redness prone skin but all types of alcohol can make the skin more prone to flushing as can spicy foods hot caffeinated beverages so really be conscious of what you're eating and how that plays into where your skin behaves other things to think about is environmental things so you know i tend not to recommend saunas to my patients we have a disorder that's characterized by broken vessels by vessels opening up in response to the environment and staying open for longer we don't want to promote that by going into a hot environment for long periods of time similarly be conscious of your room temperature where you're working you might well find that a cooler room suits you better it certainly does for me so why does rosacea happen in the first place there's lots of different theories and it's not fully yet understood but the main philosophy that we adopt nowadays is the understanding of the innate inflammatory system in the skin and how it goes wrong and causing rosacea so it's thought to be uv triggered as i mentioned but in those who are genetically predisposed and what the key finding is is the presence of something called catholicidine which is an inflammatory mediator that we're seeing in the skin in response to environmental stressors like sunshine and it's abnormally processed in rosacea and it tends to cause a whole cascade of inflammatory mediators that are released into the skin that attracts something called neutrophils which are a type of white blood cell that really kickstarts the whole process leading to ongoing inflammation that leads to these changes involving the tissues both in terms of the dermis and its structure and the blood vessels so the innate immune system is there to protect us but it's overly sensitive when you have rosacea so i've always likened it to the smoke alarm going off whenever the kettle boils rather than when the oven is on fire so it's misbehaving and the the red alert is going off too soon so when it comes to managing rosacea i think it's very important to look at your approach to your skin holistically so it's not just about what you use in terms of the treatment elements it's about the skin care approach that you adopt too and there are some important steps i think that are worth considering so with rosacea the most important thing is simplicity now i know that simplicity is something i'm i'm an advocate of you know in in all situations really but never more so than in rosacea so i think that we know that biodysfunction is a big part of what goes wrong with the skin so it's really important that what you do does not additionally deplete the skin barrier so the first thing to look at is your cleansing no double cleansing keep it gentle non-foaming i tend to recommend non-clogging as well stick to a single cleanse and use tepid not hot water and when you're patting your skin dye do so very gently it's really important that you do no harm with your cleanse then as part of a barrier repair approach seek out a moisturizer that offers that so not just something with humectants hyaluronic acid really won't do you much good when it comes to rosacea you want nice occlusives you want barrier repair ingredients like ceramides and niacinamide if your skin can tolerate it to help really ensure that barrier stays nice and robust sunscreen with rosacea is really important to give you that uv protection and actually it's amazing how patients really do start to appreciate how important daily sunscreen is all year round with their skin but i find that the best tolerated sunscreens are those that are all minerals so containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to give broad spectrum cover but nice gentle filters that won't tend to irritate skin now moving on to treatments for rosacea so i think it's really important to make sure that that's what you've got in the first instance i mean usually it's pretty straightforward if you've got the symptoms and the signs that i've described but if you're in any doubt do go and see your doctor get referred to a dermatologist to be sure that's what you have and then really you will find that prescription creams do work best when it comes to managing rosacea at least in the first instance i think it's relatively rare particularly with the papillary posterior type you'll get a handle on it with just over-the-counter products so things that might get used in the first instance um antibiotics such as metronidazole and that comes in the form of metro gel or rosex cream i have to say that i've moved away from using this as much in my practice but it's still one of the standard treatments that um that you'll find being used additional treatments might include sulantra or ivamectin which targets the might in the skin demodex possibly due to the effect against demidex mites but possibly just due to an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin as we see with antibiotics it's really not about targeting a bacteria as far as we can see it's about the anti-inflammatory effects that these products have on the skin hence the benefits of azelaic acid which is not targeting a particular organism it's targeting this innate immune system malfunction so those are the three that tend to be used in context of acutely active rosacea now if the skin is particularly active and usually again we're talking about the papillary pasteurity we'll use oral tetracyclines now again we're using them for their anti-inflammatory effect tetracyclines lower the activity of matrix metallic proteinase enzymes in the skin which are part and parcel of what generates this inflammatory amelia with increased catholicism abnormal processing of catalyst in the skin so we can use them at lower doses than we would when we're trying to treat bacterial infections which is good news because any treatment for rosacea is likely to be needed for at least six if not 12 weeks and sometimes beyond that sometimes we need to keep people on long-term therapy it's a disease that's chronic tends to relapse and remit and for some people it just plods on and needs ongoing treatment but you know we're seeing a condition here where we're using drugs that have antibacterial properties but also anti-inflammatory properties and i have to say that the best result tends to be when you combine topicals and normals together there's a synergy that comes into play and i find myself using a lot of cilantro in the acute phase and then i'll often phase azoleic acid in when things are a bit calmer with tetracyclines in the background now in difficult cases we do sometimes use low-dose isotretinoin raccotine or accutane depending on where you are in the world and we also use alpha blocker drugs for somebody who's particularly prone to flushing its causing issues so those are other treatments that we do sometimes use but the mainstay of rosacea treatment are those topicals i mentioned plus or minus tetracyclines which can be used sporadically when needed and i find that for many patients that's a successful toolkit for managing rosacea now when it comes to skin care don'ts i think it's important to be cautious when using anything outside of the list i mentioned before so things i would actively discourage you using because i think they just potentially cause too many problems and offer a little upside so i think double cleansing is a no-no i think pretty much all toners are of little to no benefit and quite likely to cause problems almost all face masks will be problematic very few masks are formulated to redness prone skin i think in a way that's useful in addition to those topicals that we mentioned that are much more important when it comes to regulating your skin physical exfoliants i think for obvious reasons are a no-no chemical sunscreens i would advocate using with caution my experience is that all mineral sunscreens are infinitely more comfortable and easy to use and if you use a tinted one you have the added benefit of a little bit of redness masking and then as far as treatments i really would encourage caution um when it comes to facials and redness really the principles of managing rosacea are about consistent daily use of the right skin care and topicals and i think that the concept of a facial once a month every six weeks really has little benefit to offer and is much more likely to cause flares so i don't think facials are particularly good idea in this instance so in conclusion i'd say that rosacea can be tricky to manage and i definitely think that if you're just starting out on your rosacea journey you think you've got that as a problem with your skin but you're not sure it really is invaluable to go and get some professional guidance on this both in terms of getting it under control with the right topicals um in the short term but also you know a longer term plan you're likely to need a longer term maintenance schedule to keep your skin well controlled but i have to say that with my rosacea patients they're often pleasantly surprised by how easily it we get their skin under control but also how we're then able to evolve their skin care routine into the realms of treating premature aging and i'll get into that in next week's video because i think it's an important topic to cover um but i think don't be despondent i think there are lots of great options now in terms of treating it getting it under control i can speak from first hand that my skin is a lot easier to manage now that i'm on a regimented and simple effective skincare routine so if you have rosacea you know someone who has rosacea please feel free to share this video if you found it helpful um come back next week to dive into rosacea treatment and beyond and i'll see you guys again soon

        "transcript": "[Music]\nNamaste I'm Dr.Urmila Nischal,\u00a0\u00a0 Consultant Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatologist\u00a0\nat Niirmal Skin and Hair Clinic, Bangalore.\u00a0 Are you experiencing redness of your face\u00a0\noff and on every now and then? Then this is\u00a0\u00a0 for you. Most common causes of redness of the\u00a0\nface is sun allergy or a sunburn. So when you\u00a0\u00a0 are exposed close to sun the UVA as well as UVB\u00a0\nray can give rise to what is called as erythema\u00a0\u00a0 or sunburn. The second thing is rosacea.\u00a0\nSo rosacea is a condition where when you\u00a0\u00a0 are exposed to anything hot or when there are\u00a0\nstrong emotions. When you are angry or when you\u00a0\u00a0 laugh or when you are even exposed to sun there\u00a0\nis redness of the face especially on the cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 and the nose. Third is psoriatic dermatitis.\u00a0\nSo how we get dandruff in the scalp similar\u00a0\u00a0 inflammatory condition happens on the sides of\u00a0\nthe nose and this can extend on the cheeks and\u00a0\u00a0 the upper part of the nose. Sometimes dryness\u00a0\nif it is not addressed can lead to redness of\u00a0\u00a0 the face. So the inflammation is manifested as\u00a0\nredness which we call as erythema. So dryness\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely one of the cause which is often\u00a0\nneglected then what as a dermatologist what we\u00a0\u00a0 commonly come across is topical steroid damage\u00a0\nface. Repeated use of a steroid containing cream\u00a0\u00a0 on your face for a long term can cause redness\u00a0\nof the face. This occurs because of the thinning\u00a0\u00a0 of the skin and the prominence of the blood\u00a0\nvessels which is called as telangectasia. The\u00a0\u00a0 skin becomes super sensitive red and itchy most\u00a0\nof the time the other thing could be allergies.\u00a0\u00a0 So allergies could be airborne. So whatever\u00a0\ncomes through the the air you can develop\u00a0\u00a0 allergies allergies to the particles and these\u00a0\nallergies are commonly seen on the upper eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 the cheeks nose and then gradually they spread to\u00a0\nthe rest of the face. Sometimes the urticaria or\u00a0\u00a0 the hives first start on your face. So this also\u00a0\ncould be a cause of redness on the face. Whatever\u00a0\u00a0 may be the cause it's always better to consult\u00a0\na dermatologist and find the solution for this.",

        "transcript": "[Music] all right hi there guys my name is nicole this is dr chaplik and dr chaplin is joining us today so we can talk specifically about rosacea and how it tends to flare a little bit more in the summer so um i'm gonna hand it over to you and if you want to dive right into that one um tell us you know maybe what you're seeing clinically over the years and patterns with rosacea and you know well that's a very good um kind of viewpoint because certainly certain things trigger rosacea there's rosacea triggers and in particular one of them is heat exercise stress and you know we live in south florida so how are you going to be able to avoid heat you can't you know who's going to be able to avoid stress and then no one wants to avoid exercise so it's a frustrating condition where some of the things that we have to do enjoy to do and need to do can sometimes aggravate it and for those of you who don't know rosacea basically is characterized by it has different subtypes maybe four or five but the most important one and most people know of is redness so you get flushed whether it's from you know walking up the stairs or from stress or from even emotional flushing sometimes you'll blush but some patients over blush and so the problem with rosacea is that with the more frequent amount of flushing and blushing that you get the more permanent broken capillaries patients will develop so much so that whether they're blushing or not they will look red and it's even a negative kind of appearance sometimes where the nose was red and you know in the past people would think that the person with rosacea was a drinker or an alcoholic but they're not they're just having rosacea they're red and so alcohol is a trigger formization typically red red wine but all alcohol can make rosacea trigger meaning it'll make it more red make yourself more blushed so to answer your question it's challenging especially in south florida to alleviate the flushing of blessing organization but it's actually very simple effects believe it or not so so do indulge please okay well so most most patients and even some doctors don't realize that the crux of rosacea is a skin barrier problem and so a lot of times so that's totally in a different direction than you know what we were just talking about with just the flushing and flushing and well yeah but let's talk about the treatment yeah so to treat and prevent these conditions and from getting worse and things like that i'll go over the medications and all that but i think most people know that there's a medicine i want to know more about you know how is it a skin barrier condition so rosacea a lot of my patients come in and they have dry skin it's very sensitive they can't use soaps they can't use a majority of cleansers they can't use a majority of moisturizers so a lot of them come in with the history of i just wash my face with water well that's one of my first telltale signs if somebody can't wash their face with a typical cleanser like cetaphil or soap there's something wrong right and so it's been proven that rosacea has a problem with the skin barrier and the number one thing that i like to recommend is to repair the skin barrier so my rosacea patients regardless of their skin type oily dry super dry super oily they have to moisturize twice a day or they won't get that much better right whether i give them the right medicines the antibiotic combination combination of everything i throw the book at them right unless they moisturize and i try to convey that to them they probably won't improve as much as they could so number one it starts with building the skin barrier back rebuilding rebuilding because rosacea will kind of suck it out of you for some reason i don't know why or how but it does and then secondly can you before we go into the second um tip um or step in this process can you maybe tell our viewers or listeners um a little bit more about what the skin barrier is because a lot of people don't know you know i try to have this talk in clinic with patients and it's new information so i feel like people would benefit from hearing well i don't know either i mean to be honest with you yeah i mean the the science is is very challenging and the basic science is even more challenging regardless of the fact our skin is our natural protector right and so it protects our our bodies and the underlying structures from organisms from radiation from all kinds of things and so if the skin barrier is damaged for whatever reason and we're compromised from certain skin conditions those skin conditions lag in improvement and so whatever the makeup is that i don't think our viewers necessarily need to know today um there is a issue and there's a disconnect between what the skin is capable of and what it's putting out there and so you need you need to almost normalize it you need to and it's summertime so who wants to put on a moisturizer that's 95 degrees and sweaty but when you come out of the shower you got to put on your moisturizer and when you and i also request on my page just wash their face with a cleanser twice a day regardless of how dry or sensitive they are i don't find one that works for them typically a cetaphil gentle cleanser or cerave but i do ask them to wash your face twice a day particularly if they wear makeup and i do ask them to moisturize twice a day and sometimes i'll accept the nighttime routine where they skip the moisturizer but i i encourage it now secondly is sun number two or number one is sun the sun will worsen rosacea no matter what it will make it terrible a if it worsens the skin barrier it'll damage the skin barrier it'll dry it out it'll make rosacea worse but then it also flares and aggravates rosacea so it's part and parcel of any treatment is moisturizing and sunlight before i even start about medications with the patients that have to convey to them right off the bat we are the sunshine state so how do you tell patients to well so they need to protect our skin so in the morning if you're not going to if you're not going to the beach to the pool to the park you're just going to work you have to use it the other facial moisturizer no matter what whether you're going to plan on staying home it doesn't matter because what winds up happening is patients to saturday they're going to stay home and watch football game but then they go outside they want to get their mail they get stuck talking to the neighbor the dog needs a walk there's a leaf i need to pick up by the time they're done they're getting sun so it always happens that way and i always get that so i come in they're all red and i'm like what happened i stayed home outside i didn't do anything yeah but did you go get the mail yeah or did you clean the pool yeah did you talk to the neighbor yeah did you go get gas yeah and so it's crucial to put that daily facial moisturizer next to your sunblock and pull it out every morning regardless of what you plan on doing because sometimes your plans change and you forget now if you know you're going on a boat you know you're going to play golf you know you're going to the park you have to take the block with you that's another thing patients will not do you got to put the stuff in your pocket i have sample sizes i'm happy to give out but you have to bring it with you one application sunblock is not enough regardless of your medical condition you have to apply sunblock every two hours okay if you're swimming every hour regardless of your medical condition but particularly for rotation and so those are no little room with that number one number two you know why would i have to patient to stop eating cheese or not drink red wine at a celebration or try to eliminate heat or try not to work out or try not to get stressed it's nearly impossible i would rather try to do things that are a little bit more proactive right and work on those things down the road personally in my practice things that are full well in their control in their control in my experience regardless what the nationalization website says and all the books say i have way more luck and ability to improve a patient's condition with those two things than i do with challenging them to not drink red wine or eat cheese or exercise or be out in the sun that's not practical to me right it's more practical too battles bigger bottles now some of my rosacea patients who need more than just topicals more than just those things they need pills they need several series of pills they need additional nuts or anti-inflammatory topically then i will ask them to please consider switching the type of wine that you drink and or the type of cheese that you eat and not make it so sharp you know there's things that we can do but the simplest are those two and then we can go down the road of how to treat rosacea i want to impart to everyone listening that rosacea's chronic and that's the third thing that i see all the time when patients come in i'm not better from other doctors and um i tried this cream i tried that cream but i didn't get better well they have the right creams they bring i see them they're the right prescription but no one sat down to explain to them that you have to stay on these for life they thought there was a finish line yeah and then they look at me like for life i have to do what for life i'm not in jail what do you mean for life what are you talking about doc so many times we have those conversations yeah we all go the same it's frustrating to have to sit down and explain it because you know the book stops here i got to fix you and i have to explain this to you it's a long visit yeah and you know they're not sick right i don't want to take this i don't want to do this but you have to be the bearer of bad news once we deal with that and i say we because i also deal with rosacea i've got a load of fun you know skin conditions that i've dealt with but once once you accept it and then you do what you can you you know you get it in control and and it's not like you're dealing with the symptoms for life as long as you know what to do that education's so important well there's a couple things that are also put in perspective for the patients so a um you won't flush and blush so you won't show sometimes your emotions you won't wear in your sleep you'll be able to do certain things if you're on the medication chronically so you will have less no matter what less episodes less opposite you'll have less breakouts like you're not going to have necessarily wake up one day from a night out and pimples everywhere so that'll help and then um what i say patients is like well so you know it sucks yes it's chronic yes you have to do a medication it's a cream at night but there are some patients who have other chronic conditions like personally i take high blood pressure medication i've been doing this since i was that's a chronic condition and there's some patients who are unfortunately diabetic some patients have gout you know these are all chronic there's no cure for these conditions unfortunately the human body screws up and does things weirdly and then so some patients have a litany of problems some patients have one but but you say these are you know they're not curable but there are ways to alleviate like a lot of course for diabetes high blood pressure are able to turn to diet and you know interestingly with rosacea there are certain things that you want to avoid with the diet but i think that just kind of goes to prove the point that you're already making that yes you have a chronic condition but you can alleviate its presentation it's all together exactly all the all the um things that we do that we have the power to change have to be kind of included and they're all together they're not just separate so diet exercise proper skin care routine all that kind of helps right all right is there anything else that you want to add um regarding rosacea specifically in the summertime or or i mean it's a year-round life round sort of thing but um yeah any special notes just on this particular season in addition to moisturizing to increase that skin barrier having you know a regular block and reapplication if you know you're going to be in the sun this is a great question so because we're going to try to focus on the fact that it's summer there's a couple of things to consider um definitely sun and sun block because it's summertime people are outdoors um definitely moisturizing because even though you're sweaty and hot you have to restore the skin very the skin barrier and the more you sweat the more dry you get so this can evap the water evaporates off the skin and takes the water with it and so you may think that you're sweaty and and all full of water but you're getting dried out the morning sweat the more you swim you're getting dried out so it's summertime people in the pool chlorine you have to wash the chlorine off immediately with just water and then try to moisturize every time you're in water because as you dry off from the pool or the ocean that water on your skin evaporates and it takes water with it and so we get it dried out and then probably internal hydration too right it's also important but then um another thing that i want to throw out there is that sometimes we have to give patients antibiotics for rotation okay both topically but by mouth sometimes one of those is called doxycycline and that will really improve rosacea sometimes in a month sometimes in two some patients are on it for a long period of time there's a doxycycline that's extended release that's only 40 milligrams called oracia that some patients take chronically but the bottom line is that it makes you photosensitive and in the summertime you have to be very careful if you're on that antibiotic because even if you go outside for 5-10 minutes whereas before you could it'll make you a lot more photosensitive so if you think that you're not going to put your daily facial moisturizer on take your doxycycline and then go talk to the neighbor for 20 minutes you're going to not just get a flare up or just you're going to summer because that doxycycle will make it a lot more photosensitive so if you have that in your cabinet that's another thing to consider particularly summertime because there's a lot more photosensity it's almost like 101 where you can just be outside for a second and get a sunburn wow that's another thing to consider in the summer and it sounds like sunburn will then contribute to that skin barrier you know then it's a vicious cycle yeah but who wants a sunburn i don't know so all right is there anything else you want to add or we'll uh we'll just film a separate take later okay this is this is a good start great all right well thank you so much for joining and for for educating us here today and we're hoping everybody has a fantastic summer have fun be careful [Music] you",

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare product recommendations for persistent facial redness I know it's really frustrating to deal with I really hope this video was informative to you guys everything I mentioned will be linked in the description box if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "i have a concussion seriously i have a concussion right now oh my god i died okay [Music] hey everybody adina diaz here your skincare guru and welcome back to my youtube channel so i just recently got some inquiries uh about rosacea what is rosacea how to cure rosacea how to treat rosacea all of the above so first and foremost i'm not a doctor repeat i'm not a doctor i'm an esthetician a licensed esthetician so i can analyze but i can't diagnose or prescribe so these are suggestions on how i treat rosacea on how i deal with it and what i suggest to my clients so first and foremost if you have really inflamed and red skin so it's really pink and rosy in the cheeks you may have rosacea if you have really pink rosy cheeks with broken capillaries you have maybe rosacea if you have red pink cheeks and you have breakouts you have acne going on in there you may have rosacea so a lot of times people when they have breakouts and red skin they automatically think that it's acne however it more likely is rosacea so rosacea is inflammation of the skin your skin is freaking irritated it just needs to be calmed down there is no cure for rosacea but there's different things you can do to help it so first and foremost lifestyle if you're a smoker that's a big no-no you gotta quit for multiple different reasons overall health life all of it but smoking definitely aggravates rosacea and it will inflame you and make you irritate it so smoking is a no caffeine the more caffeine you have the more of a caffeine is a stimulant so the more stimulation you're bringing to your whole entire body and your cheeks and your face and it will actually make it more irritated so caffeine definitely that's one be careful i drink caffeine and i have rosacea i drink it in the morning and after 12 o'clock i stop because i never sleep but then obviously i want my rosacea to be calmed and not inflamed so there's also alcohol alcohol if you notice when drinking alcohol you get pink or red in the cheeks um that's that's bringing against stimulation the cheeks you want to keep things calm and soothed so hydrating lots of water do green tea green tea is a nice antioxidant and it's not going to be too stimulating to the area you want to do like turmeric lattes which is super anti-inflammatory also i absolutely freaking love hot yoga but it may not be a choice for you if you do suffer from rosacea if you're hiking if you're camping if you're outdoors full brim hat full spf protect your skin even if you're not outdoors all the time say for example you're a chef heat stimulation will make rosacea flare up as well so cooling it down calming it down and wearing the appropriate products throughout the day and night to help soothe things down so my go-to for rosacea clients is the ameth gentle cleanse from lotus moon skin care this is completely fragrance free it's not going to be irritating to the skin it's not going to strip the skin it is so freaking gentle this is the most gentle cleanser ever it's a coconut-derived cleansing foaming cleanser so it's gonna have vitamin e in it which is gonna help fight free radicals blue lotus flower extract that helps stimulate circulation but it's not irritating the first ingredient is water has lavender in it has sandalwood in it pink grapefruit frankincense calming soothing hydrating i love this stuff it's a big seller here in the spa because it's gentle and it's effective and all skin types can use it so i love the amateur cleanser i also love the green tea cleanser this is also a super awesome antioxidant packed cleanser this is an aloe base the very top ingredient as well it's going to have potent antioxidants to help uh with uh promote cell respiration it's lavender so it's gonna be cleansing it's also gonna help bring relief from vigorous skin irritations so this is super creamy super delicious it's a coconut base i love this one as well and it smells divine so that's cleanser wise then toners you really want to be careful with toners out there if your toner that you're using has high levels of alcohol it actually be stripping and irritating your skin high levels of alcohol give like a false like illusion that it's helping and solving the problem on set it's almost like a band-aid effect it's going to dry things up and get rid of whatever's happening long-term it's going to come back 10-fold and your skin's going to be irritated and it's going to be inflamed and it's going to produce more oil to protect itself and it's not a good combination it's like a vicious cycle so get toners without alcohol this is a witch hazel base toner so it's soothing and calming this is also going to have hyaluronic acid in it has a lavender and it also has orange blossom has dmae and it has ms msm which are all going to be restoring the ph balance naturally it's going to be hydrating it's going to be soothing it's going to be softening it's going to just be calming for your skin this stuff is awesome um i also love the meow meow tweets uh pink rose clay facial soap this is for really sensitive skin types as well yes it's a bar of soap so if you don't like the bar of soap because they're messy or you feel like it's going to be irritating this is my go-to because the base top ingredient first is going to be water is going to be olive oil coconut and shea very soothing very calming not stripping not irritating you can use this in the whole entire body if you have um sensitive skin raised bumps irritation dryness on the actual body itself because rosacea mainly is on the face area but it can be different areas you can use this safely all over your whole entire body um i also love the purple goat on mass calm because this has turmeric in it and turmeric is an anti-inflammatory so i love putting this on clean face and leave it about five to ten minutes and then i actually love taking it off with an ice cube super calming super soothing just like a heat a flame can burn you an ice cube can burn you so instead of holding it somewhere move along move along move along don't hold because you can give yourself an ice burn as well so that's pretty awesome if you want to get really fancy with it you can actually put turmeric mixed in with water and then put it in an ice cube tray set it overnight and you can actually do it that way too because it's going to be really double anti-inflammatory and soothing and calming um then to leave on products the willow herb serum is my calming soothing serum it's a go-to colon licorice root and the willow herb so super calming super soothing healing therapeutic smells delicious in my opinion you can do this day and night before your moisturizer then there's also the high potency recovery gel which is your facial moisturizer it's a therapeutic gel moisturizer this is completely essential oil free so if you have issues with that or concerned about that this would be your go-to and then last but not least a heavier night moisturizer is the holy grail of of healing bombs the cherry blossom this is a combo of the shea butter it's going to have sunflower it's also going to have rose hip it's also going to have calendula so this bad boy right here i absolutely love and recommend for people who are seeking out petroleum or hydrocortisone this is your natural alternative shea butter is your natural alternative to hydrocortisone which i do not do any hydrocortisone so typically people um you know in this industry they'll recommend hydrocortisone for inflammation and redness to help calm and soothe things down it's a topical steroid so it's going to help heal the the problem on set but long term it's still going to come back and over time hydrocortisone is actually thinning to the skin so you're only supposed to use it for a short period of time stop and then go back to it which makes no sense so with using something on a natural base you can use this day night every single freaking day of the year there is no stopping it there is no negative effect there's no stripping the skin no thinning the skin there's no chemicals going into your body no toxins it is as clean as you can possibly get and i love this stuff because i put it all over places that i have eczema rosacea clients use it all over the whole entire face and love it it's calming and soothing it is very thick though so remember that um just remember again if you're going to be doing activities that bring heat stimulation cool down literally carry a fan with you especially during the summer here especially in los angeles heat stimulation does make rosacea flare up take things internally too that are going to be really anti-inflammatory like i had said before the turmeric is a great one do your antioxidants and just make sure that you're doing things that are calming and soothing to your skin and not aggravating whatsoever because it will inflame it so um oh professional treatments wise too i definitely do not recommend chemical peels for you if you have rosacea please don't do chemical peels it inflames the skin even more things that you can do that are really nice and gentle like if especially if you're suffering from acne light stem for example this is amazing for acne and inflammation of the skin and it's holistic and there's no downtime and there's no irritation so if you have pink red irritated skin doing something calming with a professional led light therapy treatment doing an oxygen treatment doing a you know calming healing soothing ice facial stuff like that is gonna be more up your alley so i wouldn't recommend microdermabrasion or diamond tip and i wouldn't recommend heavy duty chemical peels those are just gonna make the skin more inflamed and irritated all right i hope that answered everything um other than that if it didn't leave some comments and questions down below um in the comment bar and i will see you guys next time all right have a beautiful summer stay protected stay hydrated wear your full brim hats reapply your spf be a good girl be a good boy and do what you got to do all right guys i'll see you guys next time bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "it's a skin condition that more than 16 million people in the u.s are living with it's called rosacea so let's welcome dr ted lane a board certified dermatologist who is here to discuss the latest treatment developments first can you describe rosacea absolutely so rosacea starts off as in intermittent episodes of redness of flushing and blushing on the midface over time that intermittent episode can become constant so you have persistent redness on the mid face that can be accompanied at first by small blemishes or pimples that can again over time and without treatment get larger more unsightly even uncomfortable but there are certain triggers for rosacea that can make it worse okay hey doctor is it the we get the hot weather down here in the south so is warm weather a trigger and are there other triggers for this condition yeah unfortunately we're in a heat wave aren't we and that warm weather can make rosacea worse so it's really important to try and stay inside during the heat of the day in addition you want to make sure you're wearing your sunscreen because going outside without sunscreen can cause that redness and the bumps and blemishes to worsen as well so an spf 30 broad spectrum sunscreen is super import important for patients with rosacea other triggers include spicy foods so if you like eating chips and salsa make sure it's a mild salsa and even alcohol intake can worsen rosacea so it's important to limit that if you have the persistent redness with the bumps and blemishes so unfortunately a lot of the things that we like the spicy foods the alcoholic beverages during the summer can make the rosacea worse very interesting doctor but hey there is hope for us right okay what can you tell us about the latest developments in treatments look over 80 percent of patients feel like their rosacea is uncontrolled over 50 percent aren't happy with the treatment that they're on so there is room for something new i'm here on behalf of gal derma which is bringing a brand new product called epsilon to the market epsilon is micro encapsulated benzoyl peroxide formulated in a cream to be used once a day it's indicated for the bumps and blemishes of rosacea i was involved in the clinical trials and we saw when patients were using epsila over 40 percent of their bumps and blemishes were reduced by only two weeks of use after 12 weeks of use nearly 70 percent of the bumps and blemishes were reduced so the efficacy is great in addition epsilon was was tested over 52 weeks for its safety and we saw that if any side effects occurred they were primarily mild in intensity they include stinging burning itching redness even a little bit of swelling of the face in very rare instances anaphylaxis can occur so it's important to talk with your doctor to determine what's right for you with rosacea but this certainly is a really great new product that's available now for our rosacea patients yes thank you dr lane and what treatment issues have people with rosacea experienced in the past you know it's really interesting that we have something brand new like this micro encapsulated benzoyl peroxide because historically while patients have had various treatments less than 50 are satisfied with what they're on so bringing something new that that might work even a little bit better is great and we have that great you know long-term tolerability data as well uh so you know having something new in our bag as doctors is really important to help with our patients i would say if somebody wants to learn more about this new treatment or about the disease in general visit epsilon.com that's e-p-s-o-l-a-y dot com it's got great curated inform information about rosacea and about this exciting new treatment thank you so much doctor and of course you can head to our website for much more on this and the new treatment firstcoastliving.net",

        "published_at": "2017-06-11T15:00:08Z",
        "transcript": "hi Rosie friends its Julie and today the summer is getting started and it is absolutely gorgeous outside and I just got back from an outdoor festival and actually it's my local pride that I go to every year it's only the 3rd year in my little community so I wanted to go one you know show that I support the community and everything there are a lot more outdoor things happening right now and I really don't think that just because I have rosacea I should have to avoid them even though heat and the Sun and all those things are pretty much a worst-case scenario for any for triggering and for any symptoms and signs that I have and recently I also received some messages um an Instagram messenger from a Rosie friend who was attending an outdoor event and who had a really good time and it was a really important event but she was really really suffering I feel really bad for her and she was just looking for a few tips to get through it but um yeah so I thought since she just talked to me I think it was yesterday in fact it was that recently and because I just went through the whole thing today it might be a fun topic to talk about what to do to survive an outdoor summer event and still have fun and get through it without a flare-up or a flush or at least with as little as possible and of course you know I've gone through all of my son care and things like that and I'm going to be doing it updated after son care video later on in a few weeks actually I'm just kind of getting all of my ideas together right now but I thought that I would go through basically some of the ideas if you're actually at the event or if you are just getting home from the event and your face is flush and you are having a super hard time cooling down here a few of the ideas that I go through to get my skin back under control after doing something like that so I thought that I would share the type of things that I do to stay cool well and to keep flare-ups and flushes away while I'm at the event and then also what I do when I get home when I'm actually at the event I do try to do things like I always pack water with me this one's pretty cool because it has some lid like this so it acts almost like a carabiner so I can but on the outside like on the strap of my bag but it's also small enough that it'll slip inside my bag it's a kiss one it's got little sharks on it that's a topical but um I don't mind I mean normally when I'm at home I have these gigantic ones going but at least I always have water and then I refill them whenever I can if I'm at an outdoor event um yeah I will have other things you know if there's lemonade going or something like that I'll have that but I am drinking water all the time as well no matter what else you're having drink water the entire time it's so important for your body's ability to regulate temperature if you've seen some of my other videos about sunscreen and things like that then you know that I wear a huge hats and I did I had my big new hat so that I had a brim going all the way around I will bring parasols with me that kind of thing I've covered that in other videos I'll put a link to on my latest Sun care video right here if you want to see that but but actually at the event it's not just a matter of keeping out of the Sun it's also a matter of keeping cool aside from drinking water they were handing out these fans which was super mouthful but I will actually carry a fan like this in my purse or in a bag when I go to outdoor events just to keep cool if I have to if it's super hot out which it is it's hot and it's sticky oh so it is so humid Oh today so it was really great to have the fans handy staying in a place with a breeze staying in the shade is always important also if you find yourself getting really really hot do things to keep the back of your neck cool I find because sometimes I'll want to look nice or I'll have sunscreen on I don't want to be splashing water on my sunscreen or makeup or whatever I haven't had on I don't have makeup on I have I makeup on but I don't have makeup on my face I just have sunscreen right now but I don't want to be misting myself or splashing water on my face because that means I'll have to keep reapplying so I tend to do things like if I can go into the bathroom and take paper towels I wet them and I put them on the back of my neck I do things like I keep my hair and feeling a little brave like this so that the back of my neck will get a breeze the reason the back of your neck is because when the back of your neck is cooled down it actually cools down your whole body really really quickly it's like if you keep your underarms cool there are certain parts of your body that if you cool them down it'll cool you down really really quickly if you have a cooler with you toss them a few of these little minor Hello Kitty but these messages because that's what they sell oh the dollar store they um they call them goobacks but it's basically their kids ice packs they're gel so they're like bendy and um they're meant for if you bump your head or something like that and me me W have a welt so you want to put that on there well I use them and I select these things try something back of my neck if you can't stand the ice directly directly on the back of your neck just wrap it in a towel or a little piece of cloth of some kind and then just get it on the back of your neck I find if I'm hot enough and I have enough of a flush ice right on the back of my neck does not affect me I am so glad to have it and again this isn't actually ice like an ice cube that would be freezing this is uh more of a gel so it's been dear and it doesn't feel quite as freezing cold writing my skin but yeah so that's another tip in an in a bind a wet paper towel will do it just keep cooling it down and then reapplying I also try to actually keep my anxiety under control in those types of events because I find once I start to feel myself flushing or I feel that burning feeling in my skin I start to get tense and I start to become upset but this is going to get worse and worse and you know can I get this under control and things if I breathe and really try and sort of talk myself through it and get calm it will actually help to keep it under control because anxiety is a real driver it is a real trigger for me for my rosacea symptoms so it's really really helpful to me to be able to actually get myself calm so that way it's only the heat and humidity that are affecting my skin and not something in my emotions and something internal and finally when I get home the first thing that I do is wash off all the extra sunscreen now that's kind of I haven't done that yet so that sounds a little bit like a lie but my skin is not too bad today so um normally when I get home I knew that I was going to be doing this video and I didn't want to have to sit down here and yet again say I just wash my face and that's why it's looking all red it's I just wanted to finish the video and let you know all about these tips while it was still in the very front of my brain but yep normally I walk in the door I take off my shoes I go into the bathroom wash my face and then I wash off the sunscreen I use coconut oil and then I use a cleanser to make sure that I really get it off especially if I've applied sunscreen more than once I really want to be very fastidious about getting it all off I'm very gentle about it I take my time I massage very very gently with a coconut oil you can also use jojoba oil olive oil grapeseed oil something like that hope our haba works for me but coconut oil is a lot cheaper and it's fine for me as long as I wash it off right away otherwise I get breakouts but as long as I wash it off right away then I have no problem with it so I just have a thing of coconut oil next time I think all the time it's basically the container is this so it's just some regular virgin coconut oil cold-pressed this one's organic I just buy it because I think it's only you know ten twenty five cents more expensive than the regular ones so I don't know Organic might be better if it's not it's not that much more expensive but I just take it out of here and I put it into this pretty container that I really like I got this at the dollar store it looks as though it's some sort of very fancy product of some kind it's not it's coconut oil from the grocery store in a pretty thing dish and I just use a little bit of that and I just rub it over my skin and then I take a microfiber cloth and I wipe it very very gently off to remove the sunscreen and then I use my regular cleanser and I wash off the coconut oil and any remaining sunscreen or dirt or anything that's left over after all of that so once that's done then I will normally do my light therapy then instead of later on that night because I normally do it right before bed but I will do my light therapy right away just to get in a little bit more calming and cooling extra benefits into my skin right away to make sure that I'm giving myself an advantage to cool down and then I moisturize and that's it and I try and take it easy I keep hydrating for the rest of the day hydration is so so so important serifs will still happen I do still get overheated and flush at times this time was really good I'm feeling so proud of this one I don't know why I was this lucky but my skin really survived it well but yeah I do still every now and again end up with signs and symptoms depending on the weather depending on my mood depending on whatever it is that sends your rosacea into a downward spiral but all that said when I do take these cautions and I do keep these handy or at least during I have paper towels or something like that handy so that I can't actually keep the back of my neck cool because the back of my neck keeps my face cool then with all those steps I can at least keep it to a minimum and then by the time I get home I can manage any any damage that's been done but yeah so um because summer is just getting going and all these things are just getting started I thought that I would share this video in the hopes that it will help someone out I know these aren't these tips are too revolutionary but it's bringing them all together and then actually remembering to put them into action that really makes a difference so yep so I hope this helps somebody get through a festival or two and have a lot of fun at the same time because I really I really don't think that we should be avoiding going and enjoying all of these events and things I go I hope you like this video I hope it helps you out I hope you found at least one new tip that you can use the next time you want to go out and do something fun in
