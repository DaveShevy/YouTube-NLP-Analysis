        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "if you are suffering from rosacea and looking for the perfect answer for your rosacea from skin or sensitive skin you've come to the right place [Music] hello everybody this is Gladys welcome back to my channel if you have clicked on this video I'm sure you're also suffering from rosacea or even have rosacea prone skin so in this video is a compilation of a research that I've done for myself when I was suffering from rosacea and these are some of the recommendations or suggestion from the mythologist around the world what kind of cleanser is best suited for your skin I have tested some of the products myself and it works wonderfully on my skin and it also helped cure or calm down my skin so let's get started when you're looking for a cleanser for your face it's very very important that you keep these points in mind with these criterias and mind as justify dermatologists they said that when you are suffering from rosacea your skin area is actually not as strong as a normal skin so it's very sensitive and very reactive so those things that you put on your face you got to be very careful and has to be very gentle so when it comes to a cleanser it has to be non fragrance non foaming and it has to be very gentle and if it has some ingredients that gonna help to calm down those skin such as licorice root extract that would be even better so first of all you've gotta stop whatever cleanser you you right now not tossing it away but put the size so once your skin Barry I start to repeat itself become stronger over time when you are carrying your rosacea you can start to pick it up again but in the time being when your face is flaring up with that pimples acne pimple like popping up on your skin as a result of rosacea you've gotta start using something else so all of the dermatologists actually rave about this product set of your gentle cleanser and every single one of them talked about this product and recommended this product it has a very simple ingredient and it is as it says is very gentle and it's non following no fragrance no alcohol in it so the next up is La Roche Posay so these cleanser is formulated specific people people who have sensitive skin so it helps to remove the makeup on your face and also gently remove any dirt on your face this product itself is actually recommended by a tojust and one of the viewers use this product and it works wonder on her skin it actually helps to count down the redness on her face so you can check this out as well and this product again is also fragrance free there's no alcohol in it and it's essential oil free so it doesn't know those nonsense that could potentially you will take the hell out of the skin and then we have any cream vene cream gentle facial cleanser um this is suggested by a US based capital adjust dr. Dre she adores this brand because she said this friend it has no nonsense in it you know it's fragrance free is alcohol-free essential oil free it doesn't contain any potential irritant or pollutant to your face so it's extremely gentle and stay safe for your skin the next stop would be drummer quest delicate cleansing cream this product was actually suggested by my dermatologist when I use this cream oh god it was wonderful on my skin as I said at the beginning of the video I was using something else because I didn't want to ditch whatever I was using however my skin was not reacting them in a bright way because I was suffering from rosacea or pimples popping up and then my my face is all red when I switched to this cleansing agree it was so soothing and it was very calming and I can immediately feel the difference on my face once I have used this cleansing cream almost left a moisturizing film on my face and that was exactly what I needed at that time my face was very dehydrated and I cannot put any high Roenick acids or anything else to try to maintain that moisture from my skin when I'm suffering from rosacea there's a defect in my skin barrier and that skin barrier is a barrier to prevent any transit or thermal water loss one of the function so when that skin barrier is not working properly my skin is naturally losing those moisture and so my skin was very dry I can't put on any high Roenick acid because it was just gonna abrogate the brightness and the pimple so this cream was wonderful on my skin I know it's quite expensive compared to other recommendations but this delicate cleansing cream works one would be on my face it also contains the crush root extract and licorice root extract is a perfect ingredient to calm down the redness on your skin so you can check this out the next two product is also suggested by us top colleges first product is Neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser this product again is formulated very similar to extra gentle cleanser and also have any cream and you gotta look for the creamy formula not the forming one the formula one has fragrance in it so this creamy formula it has no fragrance is extra gentle and it's much cheaper than the request I personally haven't used it before but you can have a look and try it out the last one would be Sarah Maddox extra gentle body cleanser now I think they relabeled this product to a body cleanser because when I purchased it it was they would as extra gentle cleanser and I use it specifically on my face this gentle cleanser oh my god it works wonderfully the texture itself is pretty much like the demo quest delicate cleansing cream it's very creamy it's very gentle on my skin however it's not as thick as the double quest delicate but after cleansing I felt that it can protect some of the moisture or maintain some of the moisture of my face without leaving it tight by the same time it has a very mild cleansing property in it and it's Shi much cheaper than the thermic west delicate cleansing cream so you can try this out as well that is it for today these are some of the recommendation from told just around the world and if you're interested in other skincare steps for your rosacea skin you can check out my video on the whole skincare routine I'm gonna link that video in the description box down below if you have other suggestions on what kind of cleanser you use this so useful in your rosacea skin leave them in the comment down below so that I could have a look as well if you liked this video give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel to support me to make more video like this and also turn on that notification barrel so that you can be notified for my new video every week I will see you in my next one bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "[Music] hello my name is dr sam ellis and i am a board certified dermatologist welcome to my bathroom in addition to practicing both medical and cosmetic dermatology in northern california i am also an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at uc davis and i'm a consultant for skin care companies and i help them develop products that are evidence-based tonight i am going to be taking you through my anti-aging skincare routine [Music] now a lot of people kind of bristle at the anti-aging term and what i mean is not that i don't want you to be getting older as a physician i i want to get older i want my patients to be getting older because the alternative is not great but you might not want your skin to look weathered or tired i want my skin to be plump and youthful and healthy and that is what this skincare routine is all about but in sort of a low maintenance streamlined way all right we've got the towel on the hair is back we are ready to rock and roll with a nighttime skincare routine a little bit of background about my skin is that it's not particularly oily it is not particularly dry it is somewhat sensitive because i have a skin condition called rosacea which makes me prone to redness and flushing especially with a glass of wine but i don't get the pimples that some people with rosacea do get which is really lucky for me but i do have to be mindful that some products do irritate my skin and that i'm a little bit more sun sensitive i also spent my whole life outside i'm from california i was a swimmer and i played water polo through college so i have a lot of sun damage that i have been working on for the past several years but that is also something that i'm trying to tackle in my nighttime skincare routine so the first step of any skincare routine in the evening is going to be cleansing your skin the whole point of this is to remove all of the junk and debris that have built up on your skin over the day maybe take off makeup or sunscreen not or sunscreen definitely sunscreen if you don't have sunscreen on your face we're gonna have a problem but you need something to take that all off because if that's just sitting on your skin while you sleep that's gonna clog your pores make you more prone to breakouts it's going to make your skin look dull so you need to cleanse that off and the other part of cleansing that's important is that it sets your skin up to absorb and interact with the next set of products that you're going to put on it i am a huge fan of the double cleanse and i feel like if you're watching this you probably know what a double cleanse is but for those who don't the double cleanse is basically a two-step cleansing process where you use a more oil-based cleanser to remove that top layer of debris that's on your skin and break up some of the product and then you use a second cleanser usually a water-based cleanser to wash that all away so today i am going to be using the clinique take the day off cleansing balm as my first cleansing step it's not waxy it's almost creamy but holds its shape and then as you put it into your hands you can see the warmth from the body just melts it all away but all that product is still sitting here and i'm going to massage it into my face and the whole point is to really just break up that product and you can start to see my tinted moisturizer coming off you can see that redness of my skin underneath but i like to see the redness because then i know that my makeup is getting removed so i usually will take this up onto my forehead in the eyebrows i usually grab a little bit more for my eyes i feel like breaking up the eye makeup is so important you don't want today's mascara to become tomorrow's eyeliner because if you've ever fallen asleep with your makeup on you know what i'm talking about and if you haven't then that probably made zero sense to you so i'm just massaging really gently and delicately around this i'm going over my eyelashes and really trying to press the product down and away in a second i'll peek and see what kind of scary mess i've created oh yeah that's good that's really good and so at this point everything's broken up i'm gonna get it wet i'll just get my fingers damp and then we do something called an emulsifying process where i add a little bit of water to the product and you can see it turns kind of white and creamy and that really helps with the cleansing that water grabs onto the product and the product grabs onto the dirt and oil and makeup and sunscreen and lotion that's on your face and now i'm going to dip down and cleanse see in a second got all of that cleansed off and now i'm ready for my second step of the double cleanse but you can see like i don't really have eye makeup on anymore you can start to see the texture and the color of my skin meaning that i feel confident that my makeup has been removed with that step for my second step i'm going to use the vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin i hope there's some still in here i use this a lot yeah we're good so this cleanser is sort of like a pearlescent gel i really like it i feel like i need a lather in my facial cleanser at least one of the steps i might have been brainwashed by the cosmetic industry i don't care to me this makes it feel like something is really happening i like this cleanser because it's sort of a no-nonsense it's not an exfoliating cleanser it's really just the purpose is to get your face clean so i just kind of massage it go down my neck normally i would do this stuff in the shower so usually i would do my cleansing balm emulsify it and then hop in the shower wash my face and body in the shower and then come back out and do the rest of my routine but if i take this into the shower this video is going to take on a whole nother life so this is all massaged in go over my eyelashes one more time make sure everything's really good drop back down it's going to rinse it off all right so the face has been cleansed and when i'm done cleansing my face i don't want it to feel dry or tight but i also don't want it to feel oily or particularly hydrated yet i just need it to feel ready to accept whatever i'm going to put on it next i feel like if your skin is feeling too dry or tight after you cleanse you might need to switch your cleanser either to one that has a lower ph so something in the five to six range sometimes a more basic cleanser that sits more at the seven to eight range and the ph can be more stripping for the skin and although some skin can handle that a lot of people can't and so that's one thing to look for in your cleanser if you're noticing you're feeling really dry the other thing is that you can look for ingredients like glycerin or shea butter in your cleanser because those are hydrating ingredients that can support your skin while you wash once i've cleansed i'm in the home stretch that is honestly the thing that takes the longest in my entire routine the next thing i'm going to do is put on my trusted tretinoin so this is a retinoid this is a prescription strength retinoid and you can see this tube is very well loved so well loved that i am worried about getting some out of the tube right now a little more all right we're good pea sized amount that's all you need it takes me a while to get through one of those tubes because that's all you need for your entire face so when i'm putting a retinoid on i do the dot method i think this is not new for any body but that helps me sort of distribute it but a little goes a really long way with this product i just put any extra that's on my fingertips kind of down my neck the neck skin is so much more sensitive than facial skin because it does not have the same density of hair and oil glands that the face has so it doesn't have the same repair abilities and so you have to be really careful with the neck because you go in with 0.05 tretinoin and you might be sorry the other thing i will sometimes use on my neck is like a retinol so a retinol is a not prescription strength retinoid it is something that's weaker than tretinoin because it has to be converted in the skin into retinoic acid it has to be converted into tretinoin and therefore in that conversion it gets weakened quite a bit and so sometimes i'll go in with that on my neck or even around my eyes i don't want to spend too much time talking about retinoids even though they are amazing because you could probably find a million excellent videos here that go into more detail but essentially retinoids are vitamin a derived compounds that are the best thing you can do to anti-age your skin in terms of product besides wearing sunscreen which is in a category and a class all on its own so retinoids which include things like retinol retinal adaptolene teseratine triferitine tretinoin they can be over the counter or prescription and they do it all they support collagen synthesis so they help you make new collagen which makes your skin bouncy and glowy and less saggy fewer fine lines fewer wrinkles they help break up pigmentation in the skin they support new vessel growth and a lot of people are like oh i don't want new vessels but deeper in the skin which can really make your skin glow the other thing that they can do is they can actually fight something called cellular atypia so as your body is exposed to more uv damage over your life the cells in your top layer of skin can start misbehaving and that's what leads to skin cancer so as part of a skin cancer prevention treatment i put a lot of my patients on a topical retinoid retinoids increase collagen synthesis so collagen is the protein in our skin that makes it look bouncy and glowy and in our mid-20s we lose one percent of our collagen in our skin per year which is devastating so how do we combat that using a retinoid is the best way and that is why it is a staple in my routine it will never leave my routine unless i was trying to get pregnant or if i was pregnant the reason for that is that these are vitamin a derived compounds and they have been shown when taken orally to cause birth defects so no anti-aging in the world is worth a birth defect a lot of people will caution about using retinoids when someone's breastfeeding i personally would have no problem using a retinoid while i'm breastfeeding i'm not worried about a birth defect at that point the baby is out so just don't put it on your nipples and you'll be fine so most nights i will use a retinoid maybe once or twice a week depending if i feel like my skin is looking dull or if i just want to like a little extra i will do an exfoliating step instead of my retinoid i never use a chemical exfoliator plus a retinoid in the same night that is too much and overkill but one of my favorite chemical exfoliants are these peel pads by skin better they are a combination of lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid and then their own proprietary retinoid blend but when you take one of these and you swipe it over your face you get the sting okay that's the sting that tells you something's going down on your skin in a positive way i would not recommend doing a retinoid and this in the routine unless you're used to it basically otherwise you're going to over exfoliate your skin you're going to over aggravate your skin but for me i've been using a retinoid for six or seven years at this point and i need another exfoliating agent to just get some of that dead skin cell layer off the top so i can have a true glow and doing a peel pad or some type of exfoliating step usually a chemical exfoliating step not a physical scrub is what i like to do in my routine to just give me a little glow next after my retinoid is on i go in with a moisturizer this is the la roche-posay tolerane ultra this is a super mild but very hydrating moisturizer this is like five pumps i want a lot okay this is super thick and creamy it's basically like a pumpable cream usually i tell patients creams come in jars they're thick like frosting this is just just below that it is the thickest lotion you can imagine and i i adore this now it's on the back well this is going to be really smooth tomorrow but i probably use four or five times more moisturizer than i do of a retinoid i want more of it oh it just feels so good i like this because it feels really nourishing and no matter how angry or upset or if my rosacea's flared or if i overdid it with my retinoid and my skin feeling temperamental this never ever stings and i really appreciate that about this product i also see a lot of patients in my clinic who have sensitive skin who have allergies to things like fragrance or certain preservatives and this product just doesn't have any of those so i always feel really confident recommending it to people with sensitive skin because i think they'll be successful the only time i might not use something this sick is someone who's really acne prone who has a ton of clogged pores because it does have a lot of moisturizing and occlusive ingredients in it but oh i love it feels so good all right so retinoid is on moisturizer is on that's it it's the one two punch i mean it's pretty darn simple i do use something called azelaic acid in the morning to help combat my rosacea and i use vitamin c and sunscreen but in the evening for anti-aging retinoid and moisturizer now i don't exclusively rely on my skin care to contribute to my anti-aging plan or goals i do use neuromodulators so botox in my face to help with fine lines and wrinkles and creasing that happens over time i also do a mild resurfacing laser a few times a year something called clear and brilliant which helps break up pigment in my skin and also supports collagen synthesis the last thing i do is something called pulse dye laser so pulse dye laser is a laser that targets redness and you're probably looking at me going well i can see redness in your face oh you you can't even imagine what it would look like without the laser okay uh these tools that we have in a dermatology office are not to help someone achieve true you know there's no such thing as perfect we're just trying to optimize make someone feel more confident you don't need to look like an instagram filter that's not even a realistic goal you just need to look like you and feel confident in your own skin and sometimes a little enhancement never hurts anybody but i just want to be totally just totally transparent and that i get support from in-office procedures and i don't exclusively rely on my skin care if you're someone that does bravo but if you're someone who doesn't bravo to round out my nighttime skincare routine we cannot neglect the lips oftentimes i'll actually put my moisturizer on over my lips as well just to start softening them and then i'll go in with something more occlusive so something with a more jelly like or vaseline texture to really lock everything in so i'm going to use my aquaphor oldie but a goodie as you can see that's like a pretty thick i mean it's 40 vaseline or petrolatum excuse me and so i'll just put that on my lips to get everything nice and hydrated the rest i rub on my cuticles so in a clinic day you know i see 20 to 35 patients in a day and i wash my hands probably a hundred times that's sadly not even an exaggeration and so my hands take a huge beating so part of my nighttime routine focuses on my hands so anytime i showed you any of these steps any leftover got rubbed down my neck on and onto the back of my hands and that's really important to me but now i've got my retinoid on my moisturizer on the skin has been properly cleansed the lips are feeling juicy i think i'm getting ready to go to bed that's it thank you so much for following along in my nighttime anti-aging low maintenance skincare routine i just wanted to show you that even as a dermatologist who has access to all of the things this is what i choose now just because that's what my routine is it doesn't mean that's what your routine has to be but you should know that you can work smarter not harder and that an effective skincare routine does not have to be extensive or expensive it can be if you want it to but it certainly doesn't have to be if you would like more skincare tips from me and just to follow me around the office see what the day in the life of a dermatologist is like hear me talk about dermatologic procedures and medical dermatology you should follow me on instagram my handle is super creative it's at dr samantha ellis i would love to see you there this has been a blast and a huge honor thank you so much for having me bye",

        "transcript": "good morning good morning welcome back to the Vlog today I am GNA of course start my skincare routine and I was thinking about those of you out there with Rosa you deal with burning stinging symptoms of sensitivity when you use your skincare products with rosacea people develop redness on the cheeks little bumps that are red and filled with pus but in people who have deeper skin tones those skin signs sometimes are missed um or are not as obvious especially to the untrained eye and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up getting misdiagnosed and they have rosacea so talking about symptoms with your doctor is one of the most helpful pieces of information for guiding the diagnosis of Ros but symptoms include burning stinging itch sensations of warmth in the face that come and go as well as discomfort in the eyes and of course problems with skin care products and cosmetics if you have rosacea cleansing can be a really delicate tricky balance because definitely can burn and sting and can wear away at your already kind of weaken Skin Barrier to make those symptoms of sensitivity worse a lot of cleansers burn and sting so use a really gentle mild creamy cleanser if you're feeling really sensitive use lukewarm water and try just washing your face once a day cleansing oils and cleansing balms are a great option to remove um dirt oil and Cosmetics first because they're less likely to burn and sting got to get the drips off all right I'm coming in with the healthy renew face serum I've really been enjoying this now this would be a good option for a lightweight hydrating serum if you have sensitive skin because this whole product line is meant for people with sensitive skin and it's moisturizing to help minimize the symptoms of sensitivity but it's this particular Serum is not heavy sometimes heavy moisturizers for people with rosacea can actually elicit a flush not everyone but some people so the face cream in this line I really like but it is very rich so if you are sensitive to really heavy moisturizers and you want something more lightweight go with the serum for my sunscreen today I'm going to use a cavey hydrating sheer sunscreen I reviewed this a while ago it's a hybrid sunscreen it's water resistant um it's all right um but I want to use it up you know I buy these products to try out and review and then I want to make sure I finish them so they don't go to waste this hybrid sunscreen is more the consistency is more of a almost a fluid it kind of is like a cross between a fluid and a cream hybrid sunscreen just means zinc plus some organic AKA chemical filters so the cast in I find is a lot less noticeable in comparison to an all mineral but I also find that these hybrid sunscreens are a lot less likely to sting in comparison to the organic AKA chemical sunscreens so if you find that organic sunscreens chemical sunscreens burn sting but you're put off by the heavy white cast of an all mineral sunscreen try a hybrid sunscreen it's a nice balance it's not a zero cast though if you have a deeper skin tone it will show up but it is a lot less noticeable and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up using the hybrid sunscreens and they say you know after a while it just kind of Blends in and it's not so bad it all depends on your background skin tone though I wish these Brands would provide samples that way you know how it's going to look on your skin before you buy the bottle because while I like to think my reviews help you guys in deciding whether or not you're going to buy something or not you can't really tell just looking at how a product looks on my skin how it's necessarily going to look for you anytime somebody leaves a comment in any one of my videos like saying is this a good sunscreen for oily skin almost always either on a video or like a Tik Tok or something almost always there'll be someone who's like I've got oily skin I love this it's my Holy Grail then there'll be another P person who's like no stay away it's too greasy it's too oily so even those you know those kinds of things it's like you kind of just have to try it for yourself honestly um to see if it ends up working this one is a little bit shiny it's water resistant though which is nice like for humidity and sweat easy to tolerate around the eyes for me again that's another very individualized thing one thing too about sunscreen is that it also helps with the impaired skin barrier and helps reduce symptoms of sensitivity once you have it on there because it's you know helping to reduce water loss and limit penetration and irritance into the skin it's almost like a barrier cream in a sense depending on the consistency especially and sunscreens like this with zinc um are soothing you know zinc can be is anti-inflammatory although some zinc sunscreens are in my experience and yours cuz you guys have told me on the drawing side so I mentioned to you guys the other day that this like new thing that I've been enjoying doing is listening to my audio book which I'm still making my way through um it's called Uh Crossroads anyway so at night to unwind like when I'm making dinner I like to put my headphones on and just listen to the audiobook it kind of helps me tune out and like keeps me from you know Doom scrolling in my mind of just like things that I need to do and it just helps me inwind anyway but you know something about that like you've got to wash behind your ears is the point I'm trying to make like it's a it's an area where a lot of people end up forgetting to wash but um especially if you're wearing headphones a lot because back here you can get a lot of oily buildup and CC dermatitis I actually like to use an anti-dandruff shampoo back here to to clean behind my ears this is an area where you know similar to dandruff on your scalp and SE dermatitis on your face you can get this oily flaky itchy inflame buildup so I like to do that and when you're wearing headphones a lot that creates a moist humid environment that's really more favorable for that little yees malesia so it can make you know this kind of problem behind the ears even more of an issue for you so stay on top of clean it behind your ears kids so I bought this blood pressure monitor cuff on Amazon I've been pretty happy with it because it will syn to an app on your phone so you can keep a log of your blood pressure and heart rate I find that is something that's really useful a useful metric like I'm not I try to not get too into like tracking all these Health metrics because it's sort of like what are you going to do with all that information then you just become like you know somebody who just writes down numbers all the time like how many steps you got in a day like how many hours of sleep and it just becomes like to what end you know what I mean but uh all that to say having a Rec of your blood pressure readings over a period of time it can be a very useful information uh to provide to your doctor because a lot of people um deal with what they call white coat hypertension meaning your blood pressure goes up in the doctor's office cuz maybe you're nervous stressed out um they call it white coat hypertension like because they attribute it to being nervous about the doctor but honestly it's gotten to a point where the amount of time you have to wait in a doctor's office is so frustrating that it gets your blood pressure up too so it should be like um you know waiting room waiting room hypertension like the stress of of having to wait anyway um so I got this and I've been really happy with it the cuff is um standard size and it it also will fit a large larger arm and it's been doing well so yeah it's it's useful and I I think you know like I said what what good are all these numbers well like if you go to the doctor's office and you have a higher a blood pressure reading on the higher end they're probably you know going to tell you to maybe check it again and you know it can kind of be a thing so having this and having a record to show them is really helpful because a lot of times your blood pressure will will run a certain way and it'll be very different in the office so that's handy to have I've got my little pumpkin back there I'm still burning the Tuscany trick-or treat candle the cupcake one it's not my favorite favorite scent I think I've complained about this already in multiple Vlogs and I have re I purchased a new another candle on their Halloween set that I'm I'm itching to buy I'm itching to to light into but I have this thing in my personality where like with the candle I'm going to burn it unless it's like really really foul which this is isn't it's just kind of like you know I know Tuscany can give a better candle profile um unless it's just really foul I'm going to burn that thing all the way and I'm not going to start a new candle until I finished it some people burn more than one candle at a time and let the the fragrances like mingle and I bet that's really nice if you get the right pairing but I'm always like on the fence about if I should do that or if it's going to be like weird and and and mess things up like I think one of my favorite to skinny candles is the Lemon sugar cookie and I really think that the lemon sugar cookie would be nice over like some of those more Berry scents I think that would be like a nice kind of way to blend those two but I don't know what would go good with cupcake maybe a cinnamon scented candle so it was a gorgeous day on this Sunday I had to get out I could not spend it inside as you can see the sky is really really blue and gorgeous I'm over by the River Oaks neighborhood where they're all these Mansions I love to drive by these houses and just Ogle them lot of them have these like massive walls in front of them so you can't really see them too well but over the holidays this neighborhood is really fun to come to because they go all out lighting up their mansions and they all look beautiful uh it's just something to see something to behold I wanted to go to Memorial Park um and so that's a bit of a drive but it kind of ended up to be a fail because actually I could not find a parking space uh because everybody wanted to get out which like I've said in other Vlogs I try and get outside as much as possible during the day it's actually really good for your sleep cycle for your mental health to get outside in during daylight hours and spend time Outdoors uh as much as possible like especially if you work swing shifts can really help set your clock back so because I couldn't find a place to park I ended up coming over to Rice Village uh area and they have that nice walking trail uh getting some Cloud footage here I just think it's so Zen but I used to walk around this uh Park a lot um in my older apartment but I I haven't been here in a while it's always a fun time let me know in the comments I think some of you went to Rice so hopefully this footage brings back fond memories of your own stomping grounds but uh I love the pretty oak trees that line This walking path I did not know that this existed this Garden back here it's for the students but I had to come and check it out they have all sorts of beautiful flowers the garden was actually closed but you can it is open to the I guess open to the public um during certain hours yeah here's a little sign I guess um some alumni donated money for this garden and the idea is like to have a space for students to come and like learn about gardening so maybe one day they will have their own garden all right so I am going to show you guys some double cleansing in action here uh this particular night I decided I was going to use I've been using that DHC deep cleansing oil that I got from sty and I have rather been enjoying it it's very similar to the hot alabo cleansing oil um similar ingredients like olive oil but it has an aroma to it to it it has I think it has Rosemary in it so you can definitely smell that but it's a pleasant cleansing oil to use one of the reasons I love using cleansing oil so much is they're just a effective at removing Cosmetics like on this particular day I'm wearing uh that Lancome adol mascara I'm also wearing their waterproof eyeliner and this really does a good job getting in there dissolving it breaking it up I can't do makeup removers I always burn my eyes sting my skin if you have rosacea we were talking about this at the beginning of the Vlog but if you have rosacea um and you're looking for a way to remove makeup try cleansing oil or cleansing balm alternatively another good option is Cold Cream like the pwns cold cream is really a good option because it dissolves the makeup but it also is like very soothing um I don't you know they call it cold cream and it does kind of feel nice and chilled going on the skin but the oil is another option or a cleansing balm the main difference between like cleansing balm and cleansing oil it's just the balm is solid at room temperature I also started using the um isant yam root vegan milk cleanser oh my gosh those of you with sensitive skin rosacea consider this mild cleanser because it's such a pleasant experience it's free of fragrance it's very hydrating it has this like slippery texture to it which may be offputting for some but I really enjoy it it almost kind of cloaks your skin in a hug as it Glides across the surface of the skin and gently cleanses without disrupting the underlying Skin Barrier you see with the double cleanse approach the first step the oil cleanser is kind of just like getting in there and breaking up residue buildup on the skin surface the second step with the mild cleanser is actually getting in there and cleansing everything away so that's why I like doing it that way typically I do the second step in the shower but I decided to do it here so you guys could see this cleanser in action and as you can see it took everything off well hey guys I am all clean moisturized hydrated got my tread noan on but um one of the things I was thinking about you know on Sundays I do a Q&A over on my Instagram and I also post it to Facebook or basically I just you know post a still image of myself and I say hey drop any skincare related questions in the comments of this Instagram post or this Facebook post and I will usually answer you know a handful of them as many as I can and I post the question and the response to my Instagram stories and it's saved in a highlight bubble if you go to my Instagram profile anyway one of the questions I got today was like how do you deal with dry eyelids especially if you live in a cold dry climate and I got to tell you petroleum jelly is a game Cher for dry eyelids or eyelid eczema because it prevents water loss really well and it also um prevents penetration of irritance into the skin so it really is a is a great option plus it's free of common allergens and irritant I mean it's basically your immune system really doesn't care about Vaseline so that's a good thing it's just like an inert little barrier support there it's really underrated for all the things you can do it's also beneficial for cutting down on chafing wind bur if you live somewhere cold and windy um what a day y'all today was gorgeous like so nice when the weather is beautiful because you just want to be outside and so soaking it all in and such a mood boost I'm telling you summertime here can get a little like you know winter months get in other places because it's really just too hot to safely be outside for long stretches of time so you kind of get a little you know the a bit of the Blues in the summertime but that being said I really love summer and I find that you know I'm happy as can be throughout the summer cuz I like all of the summer festivities like the summer holidays and summer food summer fruits I really like summer and I love the beach so I don't know winter here I I don't mind because it's pretty mild but winter is not not where it's at for in my mind like no thanks uh I'm not I'm not Team Winter I do like winter when I don't have to go anywhere then it's fine you know it's like all cozy with a fireplace and my coffee and it's relaxing sure winter time sounds Divine but the realities of existing places that have strong you know intense Winters no thank you I don't want to be out there shoving now no thanks defrosting uh the windshield I hate doing that uh I hate driving in icy conditions cuz it's not fun although I got really good at driving in snow when I lived in Colorado like I had this little trick sometimes I get stuck in the snow like in a parking space like you'd park somewhere and then maybe you'd be parked there for a while and then we get a huge dumping of snow and you kind of have to dig your car out the car I had at the time I remember I would get in it and you know you kind of like try and dig some of the snow out as best you could heat up the car so it was somewhat def you know defrosted and then I remember I would like move it forward and back and forward and back and then I would like myself I would I could rock my own car and I could get it to rock out of the out of the space and float away I got good at that you know there's certain things that are really intimidating but once you learn how to do them and you just become comfortable and it becomes a necessity that you do it and do it efficiently then it's like not a big deal anymore like parallel parking is one of those things where you just put yourself in that situation and get uncomfortable a handful of times eventually it will just be like no big deal um that's that's a lot of things like if there's anything that you are intimidated about doing or you're like apprehensive you just kind of have to throw yourself in that situation and I mean provided it's not like hazardous to your health or something you know what I mean like within reason just throw yourself in that situation and be uncomfortable for a couple of times and eventually it just be such a non-issue that you'll start doing it all the time and you'll look back and be like why was I ever freaked out about doing this it's like non B deal all right y'all I am going to wrap this Vlog up I've had a great day I hope you have had a great day thank you so much for watching to the end if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll

        "transcript": "when your skin is red when\u00a0\neverything stings if it's\u00a0\u00a0 been really dry you've been sick\u00a0\nand you've blown your nose a lot these are the products you can use to get your\u00a0\nskin barrier the best chance of recovering so you can go back to using all the fun products hi it's Michelle of lab muffin beauty science\u00a0\nchemistry PhD cosmetic chemist and I try a lot of\u00a0\u00a0 products so I overdo it on my skin sometimes mess\u00a0\nup my skin barrier and make it really irritated but that also means I have a lot\u00a0\nof experience helping my skin\u00a0\u00a0 recover and that's what we're talking about today I also have my friend Hannah English sharing her\u00a0\u00a0 best products she's a pharmaceutical\u00a0\nscientist and skincare content creator she also has rosacea which is a really\u00a0\nconfusing skin condition a lot of people\u00a0\u00a0 don't even know that they have it so\u00a0\nwe'll be talking a bit about that too let's start with active\u00a0\ningredients for irritated skin I used to think that you couldn't use\u00a0\nany active ingredients if your skin\u00a0\u00a0 was really irritated because so many\u00a0\nof the really evidence-based active\u00a0\u00a0 ingredients like retinoids exfoliants\u00a0\nand vitamin C they're really irritating it was actually you who made me realize\u00a0\nthis which is why I got you in this video what is your approach to using\u00a0\nactives on irritated skin? H: I try to think about it\u00a0\nlike does this ingredient\u00a0\u00a0 give back to my skin or does it take from it M: what are some of your\u00a0\nfavorites for calming down\u00a0\u00a0 irritated skin and supporting your skin barrier? H: panthenol glycerin and hyaluronic acid so\u00a0\nthose are hydrating panthenol's a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 soothing as well niacinamide everyone's fave\u00a0\nbut not too much like five percent not 10 or 20 and then there's barrier support so we\u00a0\nhave ceramides cholesterol or you might\u00a0\u00a0 see phytosphingosine so that's a lipid\u00a0\nyou find in the outer layer of your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and it helps to give back to your skin\u00a0\nthose lipids that it's mainly missing then we have soothing ingredients so my faves\u00a0\u00a0 are definitely oat and also centella so\u00a0\n\"cica\" madecassoside and copper peptide M: so moving on to specific products I don't know if I told you this but your\u00a0\nserum actually made me realize how there\u00a0\u00a0 were lots of actives for irritated skin because\u00a0\nI used your serum and it was lovely on my skin and then I looked at the ingredients\u00a0\nlist and there was so much stuff in there so side note I did not invite Hannah onto this\u00a0\nvideo because she's my friend and I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 plug her serum we are going to talk about other\u00a0\nproducts but this was like a revelation to me so the serum is water-based and most of the\u00a0\ntime water-based serums really sting when my\u00a0\u00a0 skin barrier is compromised and this did not\u00a0\nit just felt so lovely so my mind was blown H: I feel like the oat is doing\u00a0\na lot of the lifting there my skin was stressed out while we were\u00a0\nworking on it so it was good for me to\u00a0\u00a0 test but what I wanted was something\u00a0\nthat would feel calming on contact I definitely did feel like there was a gap\u00a0\nthat was not much you could get especially\u00a0\u00a0 in Australia that would hydrate calm and support\u00a0\nyour barrier that didn't feel like thick and balmy M: I really love how lightweight\u00a0\nit is and how well it layers and\u00a0\u00a0 like just the fact that there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market I've been using this a few times\u00a0\na week even when my skin isn't\u00a0\u00a0 that irritated because it just\u00a0\nfits into my routine so nicely M: what are your other favorite\u00a0\nproducts for when your skin's irritated? H: I really like the la roche\u00a0\nposay cicaplast sheet masks you\u00a0\u00a0 put it on your face and it just\u00a0\nfeels calm it's hydrated it's\u00a0\u00a0 the best even after treatments you\u00a0\nknow when your skin feels really hot M: so I personally just don't really enjoy sheet\u00a0\nmasks because I don't like the feeling of them\u00a0\u00a0 sliding down my face so I love the cicaplast baume\u00a0\nB5 which is getting reformulated to the B5 plus I picked up one up in Europe and so far\u00a0\nit seems to be pretty similar on my skin\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a little bit lighter but I have\u00a0\nheard different things from other people a lot of people have told me that they really\u00a0\u00a0 like the cicaplast serum as well but I\u00a0\nhaven't tried that enough to really say there are a lot of other centella products that\u00a0\nare formulated for this sort of skin recovery\u00a0\u00a0 phase as well from brands like bioderma\u00a0\nand there's quite a few in K Beauty too H: I quite like NIOD's copper\u00a0\npeptide but the lipid which is\u00a0\u00a0 a sort of gel it's great because\u00a0\nsort of a one and done PM routine Beauty Bay make this moisturizer that's oat\u00a0\u00a0 it's called Thirst Class it's kind of a\u00a0\nbit richer so I would use it in winter M: yeah I think oat is just really underrated I\u00a0\nused to make this DIY oat mask back in the day\u00a0\u00a0 that was just ground up oatmeal mixed with\u00a0\nwater and I would just slap it on my skin it has a lot of hydrating actives and\u00a0\navenanthramides which are really soothing H: if you're fancy the Cosmetics\u00a0\n27 baume 27 which is sort of like\u00a0\u00a0 a healing oil balm really beautiful it\u00a0\nhas essential oils but they're chamomile\u00a0\u00a0 calendula those calming ones not the\u00a0\nhectic lavender or anything like that laneige cream skin beautiful\u00a0\ndoesn't have many ingredients M: I really love that one too\u00a0\nit's really lightweight and\u00a0\u00a0 less ingredients just cuts down\u00a0\nthat chance of skin reactions along the same lines with less\u00a0\ningredients but a bit heavier\u00a0\u00a0 there's also Vaseline and Aquaphor\u00a0\nwhich is mostly just petroleum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 and they're water free so there's\u00a0\nlike a lot less chance of stinging there's also CeraVe healing ointment\u00a0\nand the QV sting free ointment which\u00a0\u00a0 is like the Australian version of that\u00a0\nand they both have ceramides in them too I also really like using face oils\u00a0\nwhen I have that compromised skin\u00a0\u00a0 barrier because of the lack of water\u00a0\nit just doesn't tend to sting as much H: the paula's choice advanced\u00a0\nreplenishing toner I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 reminds me of laneige cream skin only\u00a0\nit's packed with antioxidants as well\u00a0\u00a0 so it can almost be your am serum\u00a0\nif you want a bunch of antioxidants I quite like my LED mask as well so I\u00a0\nhave one that's red and near infrared I\u00a0\u00a0 find when I use it regularly my skin is just\u00a0\nmore resilient and can tolerate more things I get a little bit tired in\u00a0\nthe evening so you just put\u00a0\u00a0 it on and then you've done skincare\u00a0\nand it's one less layer on your face M: I mentioned before that you have to avoid\u00a0\nretinoids exfoliants and vitamin C but there\u00a0\u00a0 are gentler versions of those so what is your\u00a0\npolicy on using these when your skin's irritated? H: it really depends for me on how irritated my\u00a0\u00a0 skin is but but I do have some\u00a0\ngentler versions of my actives la roche C10 is an example that\u00a0\none has 10% vitamin C but also\u00a0\u00a0 their neurosensine peptide and a\u00a0\nbit of salicylic acid so I have\u00a0\u00a0 literally never had an issue with that\u00a0\nproduct and I have issues with vitamin C and if I wanted a retinoid the kiehls\u00a0\nmicrodose it's enough to have an effect\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not enough to cause any issues so\u00a0\nthat's also a perfect beginner retinoid in\u00a0\u00a0 general and it has ceramides to\u00a0\nreplenish your skin as it works M: I also really like using derivatives of\u00a0\nvitamin C and A where my skin's irritated\u00a0\u00a0 because while there is less evidence\u00a0\nfor them working they are a lot gentler which I guess could be because they're not working\u00a0\nas well but it is like a nice fallback option my favorite less irritating derivatives for\u00a0\nvitamin C are ascorbyl glucoside magnesium\u00a0\u00a0 ascorbyl phosphate and thda or\u00a0\natip which are the same thing and for vitamin A I like granactive retinoid for gentle chemical exfoliation I like\u00a0\nusing polyhydroxy acids although I do\u00a0\u00a0 also sometimes use a very small amount of\u00a0\nsalicylic acid since it can be soothing but\u00a0\u00a0 you do have to be pretty careful because\u00a0\na lot of the formulas are quite harsh M: so one question I get asked a lot is\u00a0\nhow long do you generally have to wait\u00a0\u00a0 for your barrier to fix itself before\u00a0\nyou can go back to your usual products H: I am getting pretty good at repairing mine\u00a0\u00a0 and recognizing the signs before I\u00a0\ntruly obliterate it so a week or two recently I had a facial where it was an enzyme\u00a0\nexfoliant and it was like a bit scrubby and\u00a0\u00a0 I felt a bit tingly around the mouth I\u00a0\nthought it would be fine it wasn't fine the next few days it was tingly and so I\u00a0\njust cut the actives for about two weeks previous times has taken me three months M: that is so long yeah I think it is just a lot easier to not\u00a0\nmess up your skin barrier in the first place the longest my skin has taken is probably a week\u00a0\u00a0 or two but it depends a lot\u00a0\non the type of irritation so with perioral dermatitis\u00a0\nusually that is maybe a day or two if my nose is peeling off after a cold\u00a0\nthen that will usually be over a week now with cleansers which ones\u00a0\ndo you like for irritated skin? H: I like to use fragrance free cleanses and\u00a0\nit's because if your barrier is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 compromised then things get in further and so\u00a0\nthey wouldn't normally irritate you but they can I like avene extremely gentle cleanser\u00a0\nI like biologique recherche lait u that\u00a0\u00a0 is the one that's for oily skin but it's a cream and I like a really soft washcloth so like\u00a0\nthat really flammable fluffy polyester M: I also like fragrance free\u00a0\ncleansers where my skin's irritated some of my favorites are from geek\u00a0\nand gorgeous hada labo and bondi sands all of those don't really strip\u00a0\nskin and like you said they have\u00a0\u00a0 moisturising ingredients\u00a0\nthat give back to the skin I also really like using bioderma micellar\u00a0\nwater with soft reusable cotton rounds the bioderma was specifically designed and tested\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin and reusable\u00a0\ncotton rounds are just really soft M: now we are Australians so of course\u00a0\nwe have to talk about sun protection what is your approach when your skin's irritated? H: there are a couple of sunscreens\u00a0\nI know not to use because I can feel\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit spicy on the cheeks if my\u00a0\nskin is irritated but generally I will\u00a0\u00a0 look for one that is formulated for sensitive skin I really like those European pharmacy\u00a0\nbrands ends that cater to this type of skin M: yeah I think there is this sort of\u00a0\nassumption that you have to use zinc\u00a0\u00a0 oxide if your skin's irritated but\u00a0\nsometimes that's not the best option\u00a0\u00a0 and newer sunscreen filters\u00a0\ncan be really non-irritating if you go into like a French pharmacy\u00a0\nyou'll see that all of their sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin sunscreens are actually all chemical\u00a0\nsunscreens they have those newer filters some people actually find zinc oxide\u00a0\nmore irritating because it is drying\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite irritating when you're\u00a0\nrubbing it in because it's so thick\u00a0\u00a0 and sticky and also just trying to\u00a0\nget it off with cleanser at the end on top of that they're not always truly free\u00a0\nfrom chemical sunscreens I've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this before but there are these SPF boosters\u00a0\nthat are in a lot of mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\u00a0 they have almost identical properties to a\u00a0\nlot of properly approved chemical sunscreens I've actually talked to quite a few\u00a0\npeople now who have told me that they\u00a0\u00a0 react to some mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\nnot others and then they checked and\u00a0\u00a0 they saw that the ones that they do\u00a0\nreact to have butyloctyl salicylate M: right what other tips and tricks\u00a0\ndo you have for irritated skin? H: I think a lot of people don't know\u00a0\nthat your skin it exfoliates itself right it's called desquamation and it does that\u00a0\nbetter when it is adequately hydrated so\u00a0\u00a0 I would always try to hydrate my\u00a0\nskin before I try to exfoliate it if it's flaking or something\u00a0\nlike that and you might find\u00a0\u00a0 that the flakes take care of themselves that way I also really like doing several\u00a0\nlayers of one toner putting several\u00a0\u00a0 layers of one product on is better\u00a0\nthan putting four or five different\u00a0\u00a0 products right less opportunity\u00a0\nto upset your skin freak it out M: I also find that with flaky skin\u00a0\nif I have to get rid of them before\u00a0\u00a0 putting on makeup then I will wet my\u00a0\nskin and use a peeling gel very very\u00a0\u00a0 carefully and just buff in tiny circles\u00a0\nand that seems to do the least damage but that is like a really emergency sort\u00a0\nof thing I wouldn't recommend doing that\u00a0\u00a0 regularly when your skin is compromised because\u00a0\nthe hydration technique is just so much safer M: you also gave me some really good tips for\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis which is a newer issue for me it's a red rash that comes up around\u00a0\nyour mouth and near the sides of your\u00a0\u00a0 nose and it's been coming up\u00a0\nmore because of mask wearing the extra humidity can lead to an impaired barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and imbalance microbes and that can\u00a0\ncontribute to perioral dermatitis so I've had to change a few things when it flares\u00a0\u00a0 up like adding a cleanser in the\u00a0\nmorning which I don't usually do when my skin is happy then extra\u00a0\ncleansing tends to mess it up more\u00a0\u00a0 and dehydrate my skin but when that\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis is flaring then\u00a0\u00a0 my skin's already messed up so cleansing\u00a0\nactually takes it back towards happy M: do you have any other tips? H: if you think it might be perioral\u00a0\ndermatitis never put steroids on it\u00a0\u00a0 that's a Dr Cara-ism it's my beloved dermatologist perioral dermatitis it's like imbalanced\u00a0\nmicrobiome but also it can happen from\u00a0\u00a0 steroid withdrawal because the steroids\u00a0\nput your immune system to sleep a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit your immune system was there sort\u00a0\nof keeping the microbiome in check M: speaking of microbiome I found that I\u00a0\nsometimes get very superficial folliculitis\u00a0\u00a0 on my body when my skin gets irritated\u00a0\nso like after exercising and I'm sweaty\u00a0\u00a0 and my clothes have been rubbing in my\u00a0\narmpits and in like my crotchal region and it's usually worse when I'm a bit\u00a0\nrun down from stress and lack of sleep basically this is when bacteria infect your hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles and you get red bumps with pus\u00a0\nthat look like shallow inflamed pimples for these I like to use a benzoyl\u00a0\nperoxide cleanser most of these are\u00a0\u00a0 meant for the face but dermatologists have been\u00a0\u00a0 recommending it for body folliculitis too\u00a0\nand it's been working really well for me I use it right after I exercise\u00a0\nand also when I'm having a flare\u00a0\u00a0 and just also not marinating\u00a0\nin sweaty clothes helps a lot but if it's really deep and painful\u00a0\nand not going away then definitely see\u00a0\u00a0 a doctor because you might need antibiotics or\u00a0\nsomething or it could be just not folliculitis M: now rosacea I get asked about this a lot and\u00a0\u00a0 it's a bit of a confusing condition\u00a0\nthat not a lot of people talk about so what is rosacea? H: rosacea is a chronic inflammatory\u00a0\nskin condition it's basically my\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist explained it to me as it's the blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels that are inflamed not the\u00a0\npores like you would have in acne you'll see visible blood vessels so those\u00a0\nlittle red ones are called telangiectasias\u00a0\u00a0 redness flushing so you'll see a symmetrical\u00a0\npattern of redness so mine comes and goes so you might get sort of a pimple like bump but it\u00a0\u00a0 won't be in the t-zone it will be around\u00a0\nthe cheeks and the nose in this pattern so it's like w zone not t-zone M: it gets confused a lot with acne and it\u00a0\ntends to show up from your late 20s onwards M: so how did you first\u00a0\nsuspect that you had rosacea? H: I was at an event and Dr Dennis\u00a0\nwas there and I said \"you know what\u00a0\u00a0 I'm always like flushing pink and red\u00a0\nthrough here sometimes through my cheeks what's going on? is that something I can treat?\" he's like \"well that's rosacea\" and I\u00a0\nwas like \"see ya\" I didn't want to know M: why should you actually\u00a0\nlook into managing rosacea? H: the thing about rosacea is that it progresses so you'll start with just the pink\u00a0\nand the flushing and maybe some\u00a0\u00a0 visible blood vessels around the nose\u00a0\nyou can get them in your cheeks too and then you'll start to get lesions\u00a0\nand you can also have it get into your\u00a0\u00a0 eyes and then it can progress\u00a0\nto thickened skin and swelling M: in terms of treating rosacea there\u00a0\nare over-the-counter options like\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid you should also\u00a0\nsee a dermatologist who has\u00a0\u00a0 experience with treating rosacea and\u00a0\nthey'll have other options available how else do you manage rosacea? H: Keeping on top of your skin barrier\u00a0\nand keeping that in check in place,\u00a0\u00a0 really supporting it is number one And avoiding triggers so you'll notice\u00a0\nwhen you start to flush from certain things the sun is a big one my skin hates the indoor heating - hates it alcohol some foods even spicy food is a big one\u00a0\u00a0 especially for like pale people\u00a0\nthat only eat meat and vegetables some medicines even do it your\u00a0\nskin care or makeup could do it M: I feel like in the skincare community we\u00a0\ntalk so much about acne but nowhere near as\u00a0\u00a0 much about rosacea so if any of this is\u00a0\nsounding familiar then you might want\u00a0\u00a0 to read up a bit on rosacea and\u00a0\nconsider getting it checked out I'll put some more resources in the\u00a0\ncaption and keep in mind that if you\u00a0\u00a0 have darker skin the redness will be harder to see I hope you enjoyed this nerdy chat if you did like the video to train the YouTube\u00a0\nalgorithm to give you more content like this also share any tips you have and leave\u00a0\nquestions for Hannah in the comments you can follow Hannah here she's also\u00a0\nwritten a great book and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 how much I'm getting out of it from all of my tabs I also have an ebook on skincare and I hope\u00a0\nthis video helps your skin be less grumpy at you",

        "transcript": "Hi how are you another rosacea video today and I thought we could go into what needs to be in your everyday routine if you're managing redness or Rosa just a quick reminder because sometimes with Rosa videos I find that they reach people that maybe haven't met me before I'm Rose I'm a beauty journalist I was diagnosed with Rosa six years ago and everything I share in these Rosa videos is information that consultant dermatologists have told me I'm not going to mention specific products today I want to give you um rules and ideas of what to use so for example like moisturizer is going to be one of them and looking for a moisturizer that helps to strengthen the Skin Barrier I will do separate videos with product recommendations but the reason I wanted to do something neutral today largely is so that if I'm mentioning something that you can't get for whatever reason maybe is out of your budget you don't like the brand whatever the criteria could be this is more to tell you what should sit in your routines that you can do your own research and find things that work for you so all of that said let's talk about your routine the great thing about redness and Rose ASA is that the simplest routines are actually the most effective in helping to manage it so all I would recommend in the first instance for you is a great cleanser twice a day a great moisturizer twice a day and an SF from here it can be really helpful to incorporate a treatment stick so for me for example I've got type one and type two rosacea so I have persistent flushing and then I also sometimes have red texture and bumps um it kind of looks a bit like spots it can be confused with spots but how you would know that texture is more of a rosacea texture than an acne texture is that acne spots tend to come to a head whether that's a white head or a black head whereas rosacea spots tend to be just angry red bumps so for me my treatment step that works really well for me is azelaic acid that's a really great ingredient to help reduce the appearance of that redness and I find with the right strength aalc acid I can see a reduction in texture in literally a matter of days so even though that would maybe be your next step it would be something that I would really recommend if you're particularly struggling with your skin let's start with moisturizer now with red or Ros acia prone skin you can find that the skin is also tight or uncomfortable um maybe feels really dry so moisturizer is a really important thing that will help to keep your skin more comfortable now crucially a lot of those symptoms can come from a compromised or irritated skin barrier so when your Skin Barrier is really healthy if I could do this a little analogy for you this Skin Barrier is going to lock moisture in it's going to prevent anything from getting into the skin like irritants pollution dirt and everything's going to sit really nicely but a compromised Skin Barrier looks like this and so all of those irritants can get in moisture can get out and you can notice an increase in things like the redness and sensitivity so ideally your moisturizer that you're going to use twice a day is going to have ingredients in there that help to strengthen the Skin Barrier which in turn is going to make your skin feel more comfortable less tight less dry you're going to see less redness it's going to have a huge knock on effect when it comes to your moisturizer ingredients like ceramides are brilliant for helping to manage rosacea um a nice rich formula can often be quite helpful because a lot of that dryness will respond well to that however everyone's skin is different if you find that you have maybe a more oily skin you can get lovely gel consistencies that will be just as good as at repairing the Skin Barrier ultimately I would say as well try and look for something that's as simple as possible if you want to add active ingredients to your routine you could add those in elsewhere separately if it was me I would look for your moisturizer to really just focus on the Skin Barrier and moisturizing the skin all of that said I'm a huge believer in everyone's skin is different and the number one thing I would say is just carry on with whatever is working for you now the next one is SPF that I would say is crucial to wear every single day here here the thing with SPF everything you read or any dermatologist will tell you it is the most important thing to use every day we all know this however if I could just put it to you another way the other thing that's crucial to remember with SPF is that wearing it every day will reduce the appearance of your redness the sun is one of the biggest triggers of rosacea and it will literally cause your skin to flush and look more red in lots and lots of people so when you wear your SPF not not only are you protecting your skin from the raise of the sun pollutants irritants you know it's every single Derm as well will tell you if you're hoping to achieve a healthy aging and look as great as you can at any age it's the number one thing that you should be using but in terms of redness it's a very crucial step in helping to keep your skin really calm so if that if you're not using it every day let that be a little motivation that it is really worthwhile to use and then your cleanser now with cleansers I personally think this is a really important step to get right when you have redness or rosacea it's really important as the name would suggest to clean your skin that's great however lots of cleansers are rich and moisturizing and have ingredients in them that again are going to further support that Skin Barrier if you are in the very early days of managing your rosacea I would honestly recommend using a cream cleanser something really gentle massage it off with your hands when I come to do a cleanser video I'll go into more detail I'm not one of these do as I say not as I do I deviate from that sometimes I will use soft cloths I will sometimes use a balm um I've mixed and matched over the years and I've found what works for me but in the early days if you're thinking of making tweaks to your routine to keep things really comfortable cream cleanser no cloth you can get cream cleansers that will take all of your eye makeup off and everything um you will see a world of difference to how hydrated your skin feels and also when your skin is really nicely cleansed all of those other things are going to work well alongside it and then finally your treatment step this is where you're maybe going to have ingredients that aren't necessarily available over the counter that are really going to Target repairing and helping to reduce the appearance of that redness what I would say to you in this instance is seek medical attention luckily there are loads of online resources now that you can use I will make another video on these but on the top of my head I want to tell you about the boots online doctor where you send photos in of your skin and then they can make a prescription for you that they think is most appropriate and you just pay for that prescription there's skin and me which is an online pharmacy prescribed service where you can have a formula made for your with active ingredients that you wouldn't be able to buy over the counter that they can formulate with that will help to Target the redness or clearer that's what I'm currently using at the moment that is a dermatologist design service of the same nature where you fill out a huge questionnaire they will make a bespoke formula to treat your skin and you use it in harmony with all of those other steps but you will see a huge difference because it's been made to really Target what is going on on your skin now there are other things you might want want to add in your active ingredients vitamin C for example for radiance we'll go into all of that in a further video but for now those Basics your moisturizer SPF cleanser and a treatment step are the first things I'd really prioritized to keeping your skin as calm as possible I've got nothing on my skin today by the way if you want to have a little look um mine is kind of playing ball really well at the moment got a few little uh broken veins there that I might think about having some laser for really considered did that before but I am starting to think about it now so if I do that I can absolutely keep you posted there's a Top Line I want to keep these videos really easy to dip in and out of so I'm going to leave it there I'll go into more detail about all of those categories with product recommendations in another video if you've got any questions please feel free to leave them here and I'll talk to you soon take care",

        "transcript": "good morning you little nerds i am dr shireen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city and welcome to my youtube channel if you have not already subscribe below like the video and please feel free to comment leaving me your questions or suggestions for other videos i definitely try to read through all the comments and next week you might find your video question answered so what are we talking about today today my friends let's actually put on a little bit of um this is one by indeed it is a hydrating lip treatment personally i don't find it hydrating because it's all ha but i do think it gives a nice little color so let's start with our saturday morning with a good pucker good morning so what are we going to talk about today today we're going to talk about cleansers it is a very sexy topic i know but i figured we're going to dive in face first in cleansers because cleansers are yes an over-hyped product on the market i mean i see cleansers for 70 bucks and i cringe and i think that's probably one of my biggest pet peeves um i see cleansers that offer like basically miracles in a jar sort of situation when it comes to marketing it's just not going to happen so definitely over hyped but definitely also underrated when it comes to my patients i think patients don't understand what a cleanser can do for your skin and when you understand your skin and you understand what the cleanser can do for you it can be a game changer in your skincare routine as well as in your whole well-being routine because honestly i thought in the 1840s when they discovered that washing your hands shows people that it prevents disease spread people would get the gist that the same applies for their face not necessarily with disease spread but at least with worsening of the aging process because throughout the day we have toxins that build up on our face we have pollutants that build up on our face makeup grime etc all of that adds to the free radical formation that happens throughout the day in our skin and through the nasty free radicals that's how our skin ages faster so when you start to take care of your skin and wash it and clean off the basically wash off your day at the end of the day you're really helping your skin renew itself better and more effectively and efficiently and last longer over time so with that being said how exactly do cleansers work cleansers work via one word which has gone in kind of a bad rep but we're going to talk about it fully in this video surfactants surfactants are basically i mean for lack of a better i'm just going to draw it this is what a surfactant kind of looks like and if you've taken any sort of biology course in school you tell me what that looks like it looks like an s-p-e-r-m okay it has a water-loving head and a water heating tail an oil loving tail and basically these little guys all right or girls or whatever you want to call them um grub around all of the grime on your face so the tails go around all of the crap on your face and the water loving heads allow the water to wash it off so this encapsulates all the crap on your face throughout the day and these little heads allow the water to whisk it away and wash it away i mean it's pretty amazing when you understand science how science actually works the issue and there's a couple of issues with cleansers is that we have come to associate that feeling of being stripped and squeaky clean and if i find i wish i'd screen recorded it jlo when she was talking about her cleanser when it came out was like i love it because it gives me a squeaky clean feel and i cringe gave me that kind of like extra clean feeling because no one wants a squeaky clean feel no one wants a squeaky clean feel in the u.s of america we have come to believe that we want our skin to feel stripped and squeaky clean you do not want that because that basically means you have a compromised skin barrier that is not what you want okay i'm not hitting the table anymore i just decided to clap my hands um so you don't want squeaky clean and that is the issue with cleansers with all of those little water loving heads and water hating tails when they come and they strip away all the crap they can strip away your skin of its natural oils as well so we have to find a cleanser that strikes the right balance of cleansing effectively and not overstripping your skin my second issue with cleansers is your skin ph now for all the skin nerds out there you definitely know what i'm talking about and for all of the uninitiated out there i am sorry to welcome you to a nightmare because the skin ph is naturally acidic it usually hovers around 5.5 it's definitely not neutral which is around seven all right and usually traditionally bar soap is basic so the ph is high and that can disrupt your skin's natural ph level while disrupting your natural skin ph level ruining your skin barrier and really opening you up to irritations especially if you're somebody who is prone to that now if you're somebody like me who has healthy skin you know you don't really have so many um inflammatory disorders underlying skin disorders then don't freak out too much about the cleanser's ph because your skin can renew itself and help itself but if you're somebody who has eczema psoriasis acne a broken skin barrier intense flushing and redness and sensitivities this is where you have to be careful and brands don't publicize really their skin their cleansers ph so maybe one video will do a little ph test a bunch of these cleansers um so that's my second thing ideally you want a cleanser that the ph hovers around six or less okay not too acidic obviously but around five point five to six let's say five to six so that's my second issue and my third issue which really does apply to me is i wear eyeliner the eyeliner i love is this one by what's her name i don't even know her name but i know she's controversial kat von d the tattoo liner this baby does not budge at the end of the day and maybe what i'll do is i'll do a little test just to kind of see it's going to be a little difficult but we can maybe see what the cleanser does for the eyeliner and that's sort of what bothers me when it comes to cleanser because i have yet to find a cleanser which really washes the makeup off completely without overstripping your skin but really doing it in a one a two in one step so personally i double cleanse i don't use an oil based cleanser first in my double cleanse i double cleanse by using micellar water to really remove the makeup and anything superficial that i can see and then i follow that step with a gentle cleanser and i found that i had to do that throughout the years because every cleanser i've used doesn't really do that two-for-one correctly so if you guys have a cleanser that you love please leave a comment below i would love to know which one you think does a two-for-one correct so let's go into top picks um if you have oily skin if you are that grease ball that person who wakes up constantly dripping oil or find yourself that in the afternoon you need to wash your face again to get rid of that oil you need to be looking for gel based cleansers okay we don't want one that makes you squeaky clean however even though you think that's what you want because squeaky clean like i said or over washing your face which i'm about to touch on will overstrip your skin of its natural oils in the process counterproductively make you produce more oils so don't over wash your face i know it's going to be hard but i would say try just washing your face at the end of the day do it for a couple of days and just see how your skin evolves maybe over a weekend when you're not really seeing many people you know um if you think you cannot tolerate it then just try washing it at night in the morning and different this gel based cleansers that i like so i have a few over here i like this one by jordan samuel i interviewed him for one night stand that's when i was introduced to his gel based cleanser it is a little bit pricey on the pricier and it's 28 for a cleanser but i will say it is very very nice it doesn't overstrip your skin there is no um ha in it so it does also kind of help to hydrate it is glycerin based and i think it does a beautiful job now as you can tell i will show you guys that ooh that i'm gonna make a mess this is the beautiful sexy texture of this gel based cleanser let us see just kind of i mean i'm this is not a fair test because i have no water but you see what i mean it kind of helps with the makeup again you would definitely need the bioderma or micellar water first to get that off let me get a kleenex hold hold again this is not a super fair test because i'm not using water to help myself but that was the gel based cleanser still have a little bit of makeup residue hence the double cleanse which is micellar water in my book okay if you have dry skin you want to look for something that is a cleansing lotion or a cleansing oil and you want to ideally go for oil-based cleansers they can sound scary yes but if you're extremely dry you probably appreciate these oil-based cleansers and the difference with using an oil-based cleanser versus a regular oil like olive oil she like she haunts me at night or coconut oil is that oils don't have water loving heads like i described earlier so although it might help mush around a regular oil might help mush around your makeup it's not going to help clear it off of your face so when you wash your face you still have a residue on your skin um but let's try this one is then i met you it is a living cleansing balm it's very expensive it's 38 but blah [Music] it's 38 but it's so pretty so stupid i sound so dumb it's so pretty though it looks like mango and i want to eat it um but this one is 38 bucks it is an oil balm it definitely helps melting makeup off so let's do the second line i guess it does kind of help mud makeup off you might still need to use the bioderma before using this as a cleanser like i said i haven't found one that is great for a makeup remover and a cleanser a two in one but this one is great if you have dry skin moving on to sensitive skin my sensitive soles my heart beats for you guys um i have two that i love all right the first one actually works for the dry skin as well and this one and this one is by aveeno it is the same line as the common restore gel moisturizer that i love but they also have the nourishing oat cleanser and this is the baby let's look at the texture so this one appears to be kind of gel like as well but it's really good for dry and sensitive skin because oat is extremely nourishing and extremely hydrating it's glycerin based i will say though i am disappointed that it does have sodium hyaluronate as their last ingredient on the list so it's probably in a very low concentration but why why you had me with everything else except for this one i'm not 100 convinced because of that i'm just a little bit irked but this is a good one if you have dry skin now if you have sensitive skin it's also a very nice one because it is fragrance free so that helps a lot um so i would definitely look into this let's see how it does for makeup i mean not bad not bad but again you know you definitely need to use this with water it doesn't fully clean makeup off on its own so that is the aveeno and this one retails for nine dollars so it's super cheap and easy to get by and then finally i love vanicream i've talked about vanity cream a million and one times the fact that they still have not reached out to me is insane but i love their products because they're affordable they're cheap there's nothing in them but yet they're effective it's like a mystery product um they're free of dyes fragrances masking fragrances lanolin i hate that they say parabens because parabens are not bad formaldehyde and other preservatives and it's accepted by the national eczema association which is great because if you do have eczema you know that this one's a good one for you um does it really take off makeup great no it doesn't and that's why i double cleanse and i use the micellar water when i use this but just to kind of show you guys it does turn kind of creamy when you use it so it's hard for me to show you but there always is a little bit of a residue left behind and that is the vani cream super gentle um it's actually it's not called super gentle i just made that up it's called the gentle facial cleanser nine dollars so these are kind of cleansers that i have lying around if you have acne and you break out a lot then i think survey and you have if you have acne breakout you're probably oily so you want to go like i said a gel cleanser or a foaming cleanser which i don't love because it might over strip you this one is by cerave it has four percent benzoyl peroxide but this retails for 15 dollars you can basically just buy panoxyl for nine that has benzoyl peroxide in it as well i don't know what the ph of this it's probably not formulated to try to be as gentle on your skin as possible but um we will do a ph test one day and then larash posse has their purifying foaming cleanser as well so these are all foaming cleansers that are great for um acne or if you have a lot of acne prone skin this one the reason i like this one is because it is a foaming cleanser which i said i don't love but however they fortify it with ceramides to allow it to be more hydrating it doesn't have benzoyl peroxide in it there's no active ingredient in it but it's a foaming cleanser so if you have oily skin and you have acne prone skin but you're scared of over stripping your skin of its natural oils this one might be a good one for you and finally things i hate augustine is butter i wrote the price 65 bucks are you kidding me for a glass very heavy gel cream no 75 bucks for a cleansing foam i mean you do you if you have it good for you but you don't have to spend that much money for a cleanser cleansers should be the place where you can save your money and hopefully spend it on something else and my last tip is active ingredients and cleansers i'm not a huge fan except for when it comes to acne and the only way i'll tell you to use it is allow it to sit on your skin for a couple of minutes before you wash it off because otherwise you're defeating the purpose of the cleanser you're putting it on washing it off and not getting any benefits of the active ingredients so augustine's butter who's trying to tell me that his proprietary ttf whatever is in his cleanser great but i'm washing it off and it's going down the drain literally your money is going down the drain so not worth it and on that note i am dr shereen idris thank you so much for joining me on this saturday morning i hope you guys learned a thing or two about cleansers um please leave me a comment below i would love to know what your favorite 241 cleanser is that actually gets the job done of getting the makeup off while cleansing your skin have a great saturday and i will see you guys soon [Music] you",

        "transcript": "[Music] hi friends welcome or welcome back to the channel for anyone new hello i'm alexis i'm a board certified dermatologist and i don't normally look like this i have a full beat of makeup on today because i had a photo shoot earlier today and now i am absolutely itching to remove this makeup i am not someone who normally wears a lot of makeup so i went to the closet in the office because that's how much i want to get the makeup off i'm going to remove it before i even go home and i was trying to decide which cleanser i wanted to use to remove this full beat so i thought why not bring you guys along and we can decide how you can use a cleanser that is best for your skin so first things first why are cleansers so important they literally set the stage guys if you start off with the wrong cleanser you're starting your entire skincare routine off on the wrong foot so you want to make sure that you actually use the appropriate cleanser for your skin and i realized that so many people don't even know what that is the first thing i did was actually go to the germ closet and we have a ton of samples because a lot of the companies actually bring the samples to the office so that we can give them to patients to try out before they commit to buying a huge bottle and realizing that hey this is actually not the best cleanser for me so let's start with the basics which is a non-foaming cleanser let me see which non-foaming cleanser i have this is the serum hydrating cleanser it's definitely one of the samples that they give us here in the office and it's a non-foaming cleanser non-foaming cleansers tend to be very good for those with dry skin and as the name implies these do not foam they tend to be more milky or creamed based they don't strip the skin membrane barrier they gently cleanse the skin without removing any of the natural oils or lipids that are within the skin while simultaneously depositing fatty acids so that helps to hydrate the skin super ideal for dry skin types but these are definitely not going to get the job done for anyone with oily skin if you have oily skin you're going to fare much better with a foaming cleanser the ones that we have here in the office that i really like are by la roche posay these are fantastic cleansers this is the tolerant purifying foaming cleanser for normal to oily skin and as the name implies these obviously foam they do have detergent and they remove excess oil on the skin so not ideal for dry skin but really great for oily skin because you want to remove the excess oil or lipids that are on the skin that build up throughout the day these tend to be free of oils silicones and hydroxy acids and they're really great for getting rid of clogged pores makeup and really heavy sunscreen so this is a very good choice a lot of my patients love and swear by this one two other options that my patients really enjoy are the cetaphil oil removing cleanser and the cerave foaming cleanser both are super inexpensive and easily accessible at the local drugstore next category is soothing cleansers so these are non-foaming cleansers that are rich with things like antioxidants or probiotics or oats these are ideal for anyone who needs to calm down inflammation in the skin and just soothe and calm the skin in general i love these cleansers because they gently cleanse the skin without removing any extra lipids or oils so not ideal for oily skin but amazing if you've just kind of overdone it and your skin needs a little bit of a break very good for those with rosacea really good if you've got any itching or burning or stinging on the skin or if you spend a little bit too much time out in the sun one of my favorite soothing cleansers is by verst you guys know that i loved verse this is their gentle cycle milky cleanser and it does have oat milk as well as probiotics i absolutely love this one easily found at target and if you've ever overdone it this is a great cleanser to kind of just restore that skin barrier next category of cleansers we're going to talk about are hydroxy acids so things like your ahas and your bhas ahas are things like glycolic lactic and mandelic acid whereas bhas are things like salicylic acid ahas tend to feel better with dry skin especially things like lactic acid because a lactic acid can both hydrate and exfoliate the skin and then bhas or salicylic acid tend to do better with those with oily skin because they can really get deep down into the pores and clear out those excess oils so first let's just talk about what do these different hydroxy acids do they actually are ways to chemically exfoliate the skin so they can help to get rid of that top layer of dead skin like glycolic malic lactic mandelic acids these lower the ph of the skin and thereby enhance penetration of any product that you put after it this can be a very good thing if you've got an expensive product that you actually want to get into the skin this can get into a dangerous territory if you're using a very strong product that isn't going to do well with further penetration into the skin so make sure you choose the products that you use after alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids very carefully my friends if you have a super sensitive skin any burning stinging or itching on the skin and eczema flare or if you have rosacea go ahead and put these acids off to the side it is not the time to use them let the inflammation in the skin calm down let that sensitivity go away on the skin before you consider re-incorporating one of these acids or else you can actually make that skin condition even worse but if this is not you one of my favorite aha cleansers is by glytone it's their mild gel cleanser it does have glycolic acid in there and it's great but please only use this once a day with the exception of that rule being if you're using a bha or a salicylic acid this is one by glytone and it's the acne self foaming cleanser it does have a 0.5 salicylic acid in there and the reason that it's an exception is because you can use a bha or salicylic acid comfortably for most people twice a day especially if you have acne prone skin so i would recommend to use a salicylic acid cleanser if you have acne prone skin again it does lower the ph of the skin it can really get into the pores and help to clear out excess oil but you want to be careful don't use it if you've got rosacea burning or stinging on the skin because it can further irritate the skin and that's definitely not something that we want to do healthy skin is always the goal it may take a little bit longer for us to reach the destination safely but when we get there we'll stay there because we did it the appropriate way all that being said most people do benefit from having two cleansers within their skincare routine for example if you have oily prone skin you may want to reach for a salicylic acid cleanser in the morning and then a foamy cleanser at the end of the day to remove all the dirt grime and makeup and if you have dry skin you may want to reach for a non-foaming cleanser in the morning and the aha cleanser in the nighttime the exception to the rule is if you have sensitized skin so if you're super sensitive burning itching rosacea or eczema flare just reach for that soothing cleanser and you may want to bring it down to cleansing only one day until that skin barrier is repaired and that skin sensitivity is no longer flared i already can hear the questions pouring in about double cleansing my take on double cleansing is only do it when you actually need to if you're wearing heavy makeup like i am today or if you have a lot of sunscreen on that you can't get off which tends to happen with mineral based sunscreens go ahead and double cleanse double cleansing is generally when you use a oil-based cleanser before a water-based cleanser so if you have oily prone skin you may want to reach for one of those oily cleansers like this one here like the oat cleansing bond from inky list and then follow it up with your foaming cleanser however if you have dry skin you may just want to use a micellar water followed up by your next cleanser and if you have acne prone skin you really still want to follow these basic principles and just look for the active ingredients like salicylic acid so for benzo peroxide to be in either a foamy base cleanser or a creamy based cleanser let's take a moment to appreciate this be done by stacy because who knows when's the next time you guys are going to see me in this much makeup and the hair is by shima it was so beautiful but the curls have now fallen because it's truly the end of the day but i will link a picture here because she is amazing so if you guys are in south florida stacy and shima are your girls i'll make sure to link their description down below i hope that you guys found this video helpful if so please give it a thumbs up let me know down in the comments what you want to see next and until next time guys be well you",

        "transcript": "Hey guys. Welcome back. I'm Courtney, this is Phaedra, and you probably\ncan't see Nyx back here, but she's back here sleeping, too. You guys have asked me to talk about skincare\nand today I'm going to be talking about my top five favorite cleansers for sensitive\ndry skin like mine. As a refresher, I have sensitivity. My skin is dry. I have rosacea. I have seborrheic dermatitis around this part\nof my nose, around this part, and then around my eyebrows. Sometimes I have to deal with it on my scalp. I also have eczema in a few places. I have problem skin, my skin is not perfect. I get breakouts from rosacea, I have redness\nfrom rosacea. So, yeah, my skin is a pain. The number one thing that tends to break me\nout with skincare is fragrance. When it's a synthetic fragrance that's been\nadded to something, I want to say like 90% of the time, I break out. There's a 10% chance I might not, but usually\nI do. One of the things that often causes me to\nbreak out is lavender oil. Dermalogica is guilty of using this in a lot\nof their products, so I can't use most of their products because if it has lavender\noil in it, I'm likely going to break out. In addition to fragrance causing my skin to\nbreak out, sometimes fragrance can trigger migraines, so that's also a problem for me\ntoo, and it sucks. I've noticed that if a product is like ... If\nthe scent is a byproduct of some of the ingredients, I might be okay and I'm not likely to break\nout, but that doesn't always happen. So, fragrance just frustrates me in products\nbecause I feel like it shouldn't be in skincare and it shouldn't be in foundation. Okay, so on to cleansers. I'm going to insert pictures of all the cleaners\nthat I love so you can check them out. But my number one cleanser is the REN Evercalm\nGentle Cleansing Milk. It's $28 for 5.1 ounces of product. It's vegan, fragrance free and silicone free. I find it to be the most hydrating, soothing\ncleanser I have ever found, hands down. It has ingredients like shea butter, omega-3,\nomega-7, seabuckthorn berry, and calendula. Whatever is basically in it, it has antioxidants,\nit has fatty acids, it has lipids. It's basically very soothing and hydrating\nto dry, sensitive skin and it calms it down. It totally lives up to its name for me. I think it's perfect for dry, sensitive skin. Especially going into fall/winter months,\nwhen it might be more dry where you are. I live in Florida. It's humid and it's hot most of the year,\nbut even I suffer from dry skin. Since I already have a dry skin, I have even\nmore problems with it in the winter especially when I go to Indiana to visit my family where\nit's really very dry. A cleanser like this will help my skin stay\nhydrated in even the worst conditions. Number two is the L'Bri Gentle Cleanser. This cleanser is $16.50 for six ounces of\nproduct. The whole L'Bri line is really interesting\nbecause it's all aloe based. I personally find aloe vera to be very soothing\nfor my dry, sensitive skin so I was really excited about this whole line because I was\nlike, \"the number one ingredient, rather than water, is aloe vera.\" So that's pretty awesome. My skin really, really loves this cleanser. It loves this whole line. But this cleanser is the second most moisturizing\ncleanser I have ever found. I think it is absolutely fantastic. It even comes in a really nice, really easy\nto travel with container. As I mentioned, my skin loves aloe vera and\nthis is the main ingredient in this product. But it also has a lot of other great ingredients. It has jojoba seed oil, evening primrose oil,\nsqualane, green tea, and chamomile. It's extremely hydrating and soothing and\nthis one's vegan. I think my first three cleansers are vegan. Number three is the Glossier Milky Jelly cleanser. This is $18 for six ounces. It's another very soothing, hydrating cleanser\nfor me. I really like the formula of it. It has allantoin in it, which basically helps\nto heal the skin and soothe it. It also has vitamin B5, which is very hydrating\nand rosewater. It's another one that's vegan, so it's another\nreally good cleanser. Number four is Paula's Choice Calm Redness\nRelief cleanser. I think I used this cleanser for about a year\njust because my skin loves it so much. It's basically the product I used to go back\nto all the time if I wasn't trying other skin care product, it was a baseline product for\nme. Now the baseline product for me is either\nthe L'Bri or the REN cleanser. I'm not sure which. Definitely the L'Bri during summer. Probably the REN during winter. But the Paula's Choice is $18 for 6.7 ounces. It's one of those products that has a lot\nof good ingredients in it, at least for me. It has chamomile and aloe vera, so I find\nit really soothing. That's probably why it's been a staple for\nme for such a long time. The fifth and final cleanser I want to talk\nabout is the Abbey St. Clare Aniba cleanser. This one's $30 for 6.7 ounces of product. I haven't used it in a couple of years, but\nwhen I used it previously I thought it was pretty amazing. It smelled like chamomile. It's another aloe based formula like the L'Bri. In addition to having chamomile in it, it\nhas olive oil, different teas, and licorice root extract. It somehow manages to sooth and cleanse the\nskin without stripping it. It's one of the only products I've been able\nto use that contains lavender that doesn't cause me to break out. There you have it. Those are my top five cleansers for dry, sensitive\nskin like mine. Really if you're trying to debate which one\nto go with, I would probably try either the L'Bri or the REN cleanser to start. I think that REN is going to be extremely,\nextremely great in the winter when I'm just so dry that I feel like everything makes my\nskin even more dry, so I'm looking forward to trying that one when I'm in Indiana in\nNovember. Other than that, I'm probably going to stick\nwith using the L'Bri just because I feel like it works really well for me and I really like\nthe price point. Anyway, those are the products that I recommend. What are your favorite cruelty-free cleansers\nfor dry skin? Please be sure to let me know in the comments\nbelow.

        "transcript": "hey guys it's rosacea awareness month so I thought it would be a great time to share what I'm doing with my skin over the course of a day given that I have a tendency to rosacea just like one in 10 of those of us who live in northern Europe now that means for me that I have a tendency to flush certainly if the room is too hot or I have a glass of red one which I do on occasion um or have particularly spicy food or even just fiddling with my skin a lot my skin will tend to become pink um I don't tend to get spots so much in the center of my face which is quite characteristic of papular pastation I'm more prone to the arotic type you might just kind of recognize your skin as being redness prone um so it's about knowing where you are on this kind of Continuum I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle it's definitely there I can see the little broken capillaries and every so often I'll have a little bit of laser with Dr ores to try to reduce those but I'm not too obsessive about it I think really for me what's important is that consistent daily skin care routine that manages that tendency in my skin I'm also aware of my tendency to break out I'm prone to blemishes in my lower face although a bit less now than I probably was um 5 or 10 years ago but I still consciously manag my skincare routine to reduce the risk of breaking out and then finally I'm concerned about fine lines and wrinkles you know especially around the eyes maybe a little bit of Less tness in the lower face so considering all those three things I have to be quite fussy with my skincare routine so I'm going to share with you what I do in a typical day as I do my morning routine so let's get into this we want to talk about cleansing activating hydrating and protecting but first a big no no from my skin is anything with fragrance my skin simply hates it and I put it down to probably years of testing products when judging Beauty Awards when you will have boxes upon boxes arrive at your doorstep and you have to get through a lot of product in a short space of time so that means if I want a more sensorial experience I have to scent the air so I am currently loving this newco water therapy which is actually a really gorgeous blend of Sandalwood one of my most favorite favorite ingredients um for scent comb Ed with Marine elements and sage and fur and it's a really lovely kind of nuzzy smell um so I will sprit the air away from my face and that just creates that feeling of something more luxurious my routine without putting my skin at risk right so first step cleanse I firmly believe if you get cleansing wrong you cannot get skin care right and that is doubly true if not more so for redness prone skin I am going to talk about Dr Sam's products in the video today and that is not because this is a blatant sales video this is because this is actually what I use on my skin and as a Founder if I didn't use my own products there might be a bit of an issue so don't come from me in the comments All right so Flawless cleans is the perfect cleanser for redness prone skin and blemish prone skin I formulated it specifically to meet those needs because those needs are terribly terribly common so that means no fragrance of course no skin clogging ingredients no essential oils nothing that doesn't need to be there to ensure that I cleanse my skin effectively but preserve that all important barrier function so I'm going to do one pump because this is my morning routine but if it was night time I would do two pumps to make sure I get everything off my skin so I'm going to do one pump for me with redness prone skin we want nothing rougher than fingertips all right so we don't want flannels we don't want brushes we just want skin on skin and if that means taking a bit longer and I firmly believe in a 60-second cleanse so be it I actually practice something called the physiological sigh which sounds a bit dramatic but it's an Andrew hubman technique that's thought to be the most calming kind of breath work that you can do which involves a deep breath in and a second little one which fully inflates all the lungs alv giving you essential oxygen important for skin and everything else and then a big long exhale which is very calming to the nervous system because it activates the Vegas no so I'm going to rinse that off with tepid not hot water hat skin dry don't rub now one thing I would just say is if my skin is very very sensitive or you're having an active flare up and you're getting maybe an outbreak of papules and postals and your barrias feels really dry you might want to try a cream cleanser in which case I would use the Lage p\u00e9 tarian Domo cleanser super gentle no fragrance kind of almost nothing so next step is to activate or in the case of red and spone skin I guess it's more of an anti-inflammatory thing so for me I use AIC acid in the morning so I do use brightly Serum with 10% AIC acid but what's nice about this formula is that because it's got four different actives it's quite multitasking very multitasking even so it's got puchol which is anti-inflammatory but also good for keeping pores clear calming breakouts improving pigmentation and fine mindes and wrinkles it really does almost everything that a retinoid that you're using at night will do but you can also use it in the daytime and you can use it on top of your retinoid as well for a supplementary effect it's got some es scorable glucoside in here now for me that is amazing because my skin has become quite intolerant to aloric acid which if you know a bit about product chemistry has to be formulated a low PH around 3.5 which is way below the Skin's 4.5 to 5 pH level still slightly acidic but alisic acid makes be very acidic and that can be irritating so for me it just makes me two pink two red and the scoro glucoside which is an Esther which becomes converted into aloric acid in his skin very easily is a g option and suits me better and then we have niacinamide barrier boosting pigmentation improving blemish calming which again really suits my skin so that concoction of actives together really does wonders to my redness prone aging concerned complexion now I'm going to do one pump and I'm going to do the 13 dot technique you really want the benefits all over not just on your trouble zones now of course alternatives to that include Fina on prescription which is 15% aalc acid you could use a more straightforward AIC acid from say the ordinary or polar's Choice um choose your aalc product according to your needs but for me I want as much bound for my buckers I can get I work that in everywhere I don't do that in my eye area because AIC acid doesn't really have a role in Fine Lines it doesn't have any impact on collagen that we know of now worth a quick mention I do use neutralizing gel from time to time I sometimes use it in my T-Zone particularly in the week before my period my Skin's a bit oily and I like the salicylic acid in here it's 2% for the occasional blemish and I find that whether it's a kind of more race typ bump I don't get them very often but it would tend to be more here and I have had one here recently it's quite a rare thing for me to get spot but if I do I find this works better for me um even than say benzil peroxide which can just be that bit more drying but does work well equally for some others so you kind of have to find your blemish Buster of choice so it might be Benzel peroxide and 2 and 1 half% is about as strong as you need to go or you might go 2% salicylic acid a little bit to the barrier and this is really moisturizing which means I don't get that dry cornflake patch after I've applied it so I can put concealer on the spot too but for nighttime all I would do is swap in AIC acid for something that's retinoid based now that's allowing my morning routine to take precedence in terms of the redness solution side of things whereas at nighttime I'm focusing more on the health and well-being of my dermal Matrix so that means a retinoid and if I'm a little more on the dry side I'll go nightly Pro and if I'm I don't know gearing up for something important maybe I'm filming in a week's time I'll go a little harder on the prescription side of things so this is a baji treso point not five I do think using a retinoid is really helpful because so many people who've got rosacea have also got evidence of premature aging I think retinoids at night just makes sense um but you have to calibrate it according to where your redness is at and if you're in an active flare up do not use a red oid stick to your anti-inflammatories so once my actives have fully absorbed in my skin is touched dry then I'll come on to moisturization and hydration so a fundamental step even for combination skin so 65% of us have combination skin it's normal for me usually it means just using a moisturizer according to how dry or not my cheeks are or whether or not I want in this case nide which is in Flawless moisturizer or saram which is moisturizer light now in my Oiler half of my cycle so after day 14 I tend to lean into moisturizer light um the camid are just lovely around the eyes but you know equally Flawless moisturizer I don't feel too strongly about it um this would probably give me a slightly better finished my makeup at the end of the day but i' would have to block my T-Zone a bit more so it's really swings and roundabouts using what you need when you need it and kind of becoming that expert of your own skin mastering your own skin skin knowing what it needs and when it needs it so today I'm going to do full fat Flawless Moisturizer in this luscious large size now and one pump is almost always enough for me we're just going to do you guessed it 13 dots I just find it such a helpful ritual and I almost default to it now it would never occur to me just to do that and put it all on without precision and you know I use my under my fourth finger for my my under eyee area and I really work it in cuz I want that nice smooth base with concealer application and then I'll just kind of lightly Glide it in elsewhere might do a little bit of massage it feels good get the knuckles in there and then you know work it around your upper lip just don't miss bits um and I find if you stick to doing one or two fingers with your application technique you get a more thorough layer of hydration to all the nooks and crannies and then when it comes to your makeup you just don't get those dry patches time care and consistency and I do the same amount on my neck direct my neck okay good final step is to protect and sunscreen is almost as important as your actives when it comes to managing redness prone skin and for me I'm a mineral sunscreen obsessive because it suits my skin so well and particularly with a little tint because it just helps mask redness so I've got a lot less to do with my Cosmetics so I'm going to go in with gosma tint one um good news on the gosma tint two front guys any day now it's only been 3 years so yeah and I'm going to be really generous with it and it's going to look a bit scary and then it'll look fine because that's what minimal sunscreen does all right so we're going to do two thin layers and I'm going to do a bit of flawless daily sunscreen on my neck which is untinted because life is too short to deal with tinted sunscreen on the neck and then I'm just going to do my neck a bit of flawless daily sunscreen in a pinch I can do without moisturizer on my neck and it's got some ni cinnamide in there which is such a great ingredient for my neck but it is just a great moisturizer as well so lovely shade that's face and neck protected and perfected so I just done my makeup of camera um I did film that so if you want to see it let me know in the comments and really I think you need to learn to master your skin I'm really passionate about that that kind of is the premise of the whole Dr Sam's brand is Know Thy skin know thyself Know Thy skin so I hope that seeing what I do to my skin in a typical day helps you build an effective skincare plan so you can enjoy the benefits of healthy glowing skin thanks for joining me guys see you again soon",

        "transcript": "April is rosacea awareness a month and for those of you who know me in the channel you know that I've posted a lot about my struggles with rosacea some of the products that I've used to help overcome it and I say overcome it kind of loosely um I've come to terms with it I recognize what my triggers are I understand better how to maintain My Skin Barrier and most importantly focus on the treatments and medications that give me the best outcome for my skin I will say rosacea is definitely a marathon and not a Sprint as is most things with skin care there's rarely an overnight success or magic treatment that's gonna solve all your skin issues no matter what they are but certainly that's the case with rosacea at least that's been my experience while I have my rosacea pretty much under control I still have flare-ups I still have irritation I still kind of regress backwards so I just wanted to kind of sit back relax and do a little bit of an update video for you on how my rosacea my skin is doing now and what I attribute My Success to my skin in at its lowest point look like this but you can see now I specifically for today's video I'm not wearing any foundation BB cream CC cream I chose a tinted mineral sunscreen it's really new to me it was sent to me in PR it's naked Sunday's tinted mineral sunscreen I like the tinted mineral sunscreens of course because they offset the white cast overall my skin is just so much better than it was not to say that I don't still have flare-ups I do especially when I ignore my triggers which I know full well what they are red wine which sucks because I love red wine spicy foods also sucks I love spicy foods and my husband likes to cook spicy foods so yeah sometimes I have to suffer through the aftermath with my skin and the sun it's very hard to avoid the Sun but I do my best to mitigate that so I will wear a hat when I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time and I always always wear a daily sunscreen my view on sunscreen is honestly just find one you love and you use that speaking of setbacks recently I was traveling staying in a hotel room you know the air is different in the hotel room I was drinking red wine with dinner the climate was slightly different you can see on my face here how my rosacea flares and it's almost immediately so as much as I try to control my triggers and set the situation to be optimal for Success it still happens I'll tell you what I did in my story and hopefully you can just extrapolate from that something that may be useful for you of course you should be in consultation with a medical professional I'm not that I'm simply here to share with you my story and my experience so that hopefully it can arm you with some more information and help you along the way if nothing else to know you're not alone the Hallmarks on my rosacea is an impaired barrier Associated redness and flushing irritation inflammation and pimples back when it was at its worst this is what I did I stopped everything in my skincare routine basically put myself on a skincare diet I I went back to the very basics of cleansing and moisturizing my skin and when it comes to Cleansing just choose a cleanser that's very gentle and hydrating that's what worked for me I've used this Cetaphil Vana cream was one of my favorites uh this one by avino continues to be one of my favorites it's their common restore line and I wanted to call out this one this is the glucoside foaming cleanser and while this is a new launch from the ordinary I've been really enjoying this product for my skin my children have been using it too and they also have very sensitive skin it was tested on babies originally and it's just been a really lovely cleanser so back then when I was at my worst I wish I would have had something like this too I've also used cerave's hydrating cleanser it's really just about finding the one that works best for you within your price point I only cleanse my skin at night with a cleanser in the morning I use water only this is one of the ways I was able to keep my barrier intact the cleansing process just seemed to be too much for my skin if I was doing it morning and night so that was really a game changer for me for moisturizers I like to offer something that's rich in ceramides and that is a little bit occlusive to lock that moisture into the skin because one of the Hallmarks of rosacea is a damaged Skin Barrier it has trouble holding and retaining that moisture into the skin so if you can do that with your moisturizer you're ahead of the game so cerave's moisturizing lotion is a great one love regimen Labs cream this is their second iteration of this particular product they've actually improved the consistency and the applicability of this on the skin it's far less thick and more spreadable I'd say on the skin and this one's fabulous because it has ceramides as does the CeraVe one it's a higher price point for this but I just really love this brand for a gel type moisturizer going back to Aveeno this common restore line has just been really good for my skin I love this it's drugstore so it's readily accessible and great for my combination skin sometimes I don't want a thick Rich moisturizer this can be great in the morning and a thicker richer cream in the evening is sometimes what I opt for but another new launch from the ordinary they've improved or added to their natural moisturizing factors line and this one is their natural moisturizing factors plus phytoceramides so again just adding more ceramides into the formulation making this a really good moisturizer for rosacea in my opinion and also for those of you with dry skin when it comes to daily sunscreen my opinion just find one that works for you whether it's chemical mineral hybrid whatever it is tinted non-tinted cheap expensive if you're gonna put it on your face every day go with that one I'm being facetious because sometimes sunscreen can be irritating to some and you want to find the one that best suits your skin I've actually created a shop my which really lists the products that are my favorites by category those are affiliate links so you don't have to purchase through through those just look at what the products are and then you can Google and purchase on your own because otherwise I make a very small commission if you purchase from those links so if you want to great and thank you if you don't totally fine as well but the point is to be able to share with you what my favorites are by genre so I'll link my favorites below for my sunscreen category so you can take a look through there ask me specific questions in the comments if you have about any particular product all of the ones that are listed there are ones that have worked for my skin so I hope you find that helpful I did want to call it this product that came to me in PR this is by Dr jard it's your secret pair tiger grass Camp drops they're really neat and it's green looks kind of gross but if you know the color wheel green offsets or neutralizes red now this is an SPF 35 but I actually use this kind of more like makeup and then it's just giving me that additional sun protection so I apply whatever sunscreen I'm wearing wearing for the day and then I put a few drops of this over top and it really neutralizes the red so I'm kind of almost using it like makeup as opposed to sunscreen but definitely impressed with this product for me Beyond getting a basic skincare routine in place and focusing on restoring and repairing My Skin Barrier without adding in any active ingredients like retinoids and vitamin Cs and acids and all that stuff just keeping it to the basics I also needed medical intervention so at the time I was prescribed this which is metrogel this is an antibiotic gel often used for people who struggle with rosacea I can say that this was definitely responsible for getting my rosacea under control in that kind of acute flare-up phase that I was in once My Skin Barrier was intact and things were calmed down settled down that's when I could reintroduce the active ingredients into my skincare routine such as my vitamin C retinoids Etc so just because I have rosacea doesn't mean that I can't capitalize on those things it's just sometimes I have to opt for versions that are more sensitive skin friendly and when I have a flare-up I kind of revert back to the basics again just to be sure my Skin's under control before I reintroduce those active ingredients in my skincare routines the next thing and it's no surprise for those of you who have watched my channel for a while it's the thing that I actually attribute my kind of ongoing success with my rosacea is azelic acid I feel like it is really responsible for keeping my rosacea obey and maintaining My Skin Barrier overall I have used over-the-counter acelaic acid serums for years and I can say some of my favorites are Paula's Choice 10 azoleic acid booster and this one by theramid it's their acid or azid I'm not sure how it's pronounced but this one's at 15 azaleaic acid I was impressed with this one because it's actually the same percentage of azelic acid as my prescription and strength osoletic acid and I fairly recently started this prescription phenacea finessia tomato tomato I'm not sure but it's a 15 prescription only here in Canada as oleic acid now the different approach I've had with this one versus the other ones is that I was normally using those once a day generally in my morning skincare routine paired with my vitamin C but I've been using this one now for about six weeks twice a day morning and evening skincare routine it's another reason I love this as a product azelic acid it pairs well with so many other things it really doesn't have conflicts you don't have to worry about it I use it in my evening skincare routine paired with my retinoid in my morning skincare routine pair with my vitamin C the only thing I don't do is I don't put it in the same routine as my acid day when I use my aha or Alpha hydroxy acid it's once a week and I just focus on the acid and hydrating skin care products to surround that routine I'm only six weeks into this sort of regime so I will definitely do an update for you later on but already I am reaping the benefits of this overall I can feel that my skin is just more calm and healthy azelic acid has so many health benefits for the skin especially for rosacea it works to decrease the swelling the associated redness but is really effective at targeting the bacteria that's in the pores that can also contribute to the pimples associated with rosacea making this also a great product or great ingredient for those of you with acne prone skin of course there can be Associated side effects I think primarily those are tingling stinging and even drawing of the skin I personally haven't had that experience so I'd love to hear from those of you who perhaps have had that experience you can share that in the comments section below but certainly if you're using a prescription nasolic acid you'd be in consultation with a medical professional and of course they'd be able to talk to you more about that but if you're using OTC or over-the-counter azoleic acids just be aware you're experiencing that as well I will continue to monitor my rosacea with you and I'll do more updates as we go along and just see how my journey goes because I'm hoping it's helping you to understand more about the disease and spreading awareness which is what the April rosacea awareness month is all about I'll drop some information on that in particular below I would really really love it if you would share your thoughts experiences comments in the comments section below if you haven't watched them already be sure to watch these videos up on screen and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "hi friends welcome back to my channel I'm Sarah Martin with the contoured chemist and today I'm coming at you makeup free because we're going to be talking a little bit about skin care and more specifically rosacea this is something I have a lot of experience with it is rosacea awareness month and so I'm going to go into what it is the best products and ingredients to use to keep it under control and my regimen if you want to check it out please keep watching be sure to hit that like And subscribe button and as always thank you guys for being [Music] [Applause] [Music] here oh friends rosacea I've have been asked to cover this subject many times and I figured you know what I've never talked about it and it's rosacea awareness month so this is the perfect time before the end of April I'm I'm squeezing it in here at the last week so what I find most interesting about rosacea is that most people don't even realize they have it I will be honest I didn't know I had it I just thought I was a little red and I wasn't sure until I was at the dermatologist and they said oh you have a little rosacea right there and I was like what I do I had no clue and most people don't really realize that the only way um of diagnosing it is visually and so you might not know it unless you're actively at the dermatologist regularly and since I'm constantly getting skin checks that's how I found out I had it 15 million Americans 115 million worldwide it's extremely common so what exactly is rosacea it's actually a chronic inflammatory skin condition and it is a medical condition so unfortunately there is no cure but there are ways you can control it and so I'm going to be going over a lot of that today um it's something that I know I've been experimenting with and trial and error for years even before I had it just to kind of control my redness so if you have frequent blushing if you frequently feel warm to the touch you frequently blush but usually rosacea comes and goes I always say if it's redness that fluctuates that's Rosa you can actually just start with like skin sensitivity if you feel like your Skin's getting a little sensitive and it's actually something that I guess I didn't realize because I didn't you don't have it as an adolescent you don't have it when you're younger it is the age 30 to 60 so a lot of times it doesn't show up until you get into your mid-30s and then you're just like why am I suddenly red why is my skin suddenly more sensitive unfortunately that's Ros obviously it's most common in white Caucasian fairer skin tone honestly that's because it's more easily diagnosed because you can see it more the the difference and the redness and their skin tone it's more apparent and like I said it's only something that is visually diagnosed say 30 to 50% of the Caucasian population have it is in Darker skin tones as well you just can't see it as easily now like I said there is no known cure but that's mainly because there is a lot of agreement on what actually causes it um and nobody knows for sure but there's a lot of different things that they've noticed in those with rosacea genetics is for for sure a huge part of it you notice people with rosacea actually have more more of a common skin parasite known as dimdex um it sounds really gross but like it is a common skin Mite that is on normal skin so everyone has it they've just know noticed that those with rosacea tend to have more of them they think maybe it's because of hyperactive blood vessels our inflammatory systems are different and most think it's just a combination probably all of them and then there's culmination and that can kind of determine how bad yours is because it really can fluctuate person to person time a year all of those things it does take experimenting to figure out what can control it for your skin I always say everyone's skin is so different what will alleviate some of your symptoms have to learn certain triggers so there are a lot of known triggers for rosacea I most certainly have figured out mine over the years do not put me on uh patio in summer and give me any alcohol of any sort or you will see me I will turn as red as a tomato it's so bad sunlight heat alcohol um even worse I've noticed are hot alcoholic drinks like what is it called an Irish coffee hot totty I don't even know but those are like the worst a hot alcoholic beverage forget about it learn your triggers learn those lifestyle choices and some of these are honestly impossible to avoid but like just know these are all possibilities and you'll kind of be able to assess your own skin and what your triggers are anything that can bring that Rush of Blood to the face so sun exposure okay wear your sunscreen totally helps wind heat heat is a big one for me that is changes of temperature any hot climate hot showers saunas steam like my husband wants a sauna for our house and I was like no no I I will never use it it will just inflame my rosacea and bring out my hyperpigmentation two of my triggers I know it won't use it so I know there's health benefits but it'll mess up my skin so I'm like hard strenuous exercise um I can't tell you the number of times I've worked out and people are like are you okay my entire face turns beat red and it will for hours and it's like I look at my little son cuz my youngest is the exact same way people are like is he sunburnt and it's like he just played a baseball game I'm like no it's because he does any exercise his total his whole face turns beat red and I'm like he's going to be exactly like me one day there's no stopping it either you can stay as cool as you want it's just blood flow so there's no avoiding that maybe I shouldn't exercise I'm just kidding em stress and this one is a big one emotional stress especially um I can tell you the first instance of my rosacea having a flare up and it was when I was defending my thesis in organic chemistry I remember the practice when I was doing it in front of my um my group I was in and um it just started as like this like redness that started on my chest and worked its way up my neck like visually you could see it and then went all the way over my face so bad that when I finally did have to do my final defense I wore a turtleneck that's how embarrassed I was of this it just the stress like visually just showed itself on my body and I know now that that was just a trigger that was like my first case of rosace no back then I didn't know what it was but I know now okay specific ingredients now this one is going to widely vary from person to person I see a lot of people um like essential oils is a big one I know that one is for me like just because it's a so-called natural ingredient does not mean it isn't irritating for you in fact there's more known allergens for essential oils and natural ingredients than there are synthetic ones because to be honest in a lab it can be controlled and they know the known allergens and so they take those things out but a lot of these natural skincare products that are on the market aren't necessarily better like they sound better that they're not going to be as irritating or sensitizing but in fact a lot of those are way worse essential oils on the label is is something that I um I just got sent a product in PR first time I used it I was like I I can't because it was essential oils as The fragran Fragrant oil extracts look for out for things like that that can be a huge trigger in a lot of people oh the next one's hard spicy foods alcohol caffeine sorry you're going to have to take my coffee from my cold dead fingers like there's certain things that I know all of us are not willing to give up but hot beverages I love my hot beverages I just know I can't put alcohol in hot beverages ever or I will turn so flushed scratchy Fabrics across your skin um like rough exfoliators this one was huge for me again I didn't realize how bad abrasive scrubs and like things like Clarisonic brushes things like that that cause l of manual physical exfoliation that is in any kind of rough manner is very big for those of us that have Ros like I said you can try to avoid those obviously everyone's kind of triggers will be a little bit different okay I want to quickly go over the four types just so you're aware that rosacea really varies as far as um what kind of type and category you're in so I am a type one ooh I don't know if I can even pronounce this this word but I'll put it down here uh urethr it is not a chemistry word it is a medical term therefore arthia is redness and flushing of the skit so I got that part the rest is hard this is the most common this is the butterfly pattern so when they say butterfly pattern this is what's most common for rosacea just think of the shape of a butterfly so across your cheeks forehead nose and Chin so it kind of avoids those other areas and is exactly where my redness is which makes sense because I was diagnosed okay so when blood vessels um or what we call we referred to as broken capillaries and spider veins they're not technically broken capillaries but that's what everyone calls them when they're visible Under the Skin that's type one so if you zoom in I mean obviously around my nose is very visible like I have some large ones but if I really zoom in on my cheek area I can see itty bitty ones some of some people have it a lot more extreme where it's very visible but like if you can see very little ones that's why my redness never fully goes away I always have those um but I can keep that flushing and the increase totally at Bay but you know the damage has been done they're already there when your skin feels warm to the touch like my cheeks if you react to stimuli so this is why when I'm washing my face my face turns very red it's not just a skin sensitivity that's part of rosacea when it turns red on contact like while I'm putting on my makeup and then it has to kind of die back down that's that blood coming to the face it just happens more so in People Like Us which is again why they think it has something to do with that reaction of blood vessels under the skin type two is Papo plus pular um this is when you have redness and bumps and this is what's commonly referred to as acne rosacea but it's not actually acne it's the rosacea so this is when you get pimple like spots bumps okay and so the way you can determine if that is if you actually have acne or not be where rosacea lies and it won't be in other areas you also won't have blackheads okay there's a difference like with acne you will have blackheads here they might look like acne but maybe you do a traditional acne treatment and it just makes it worse that's a good sign that it's actually this type two rosacea and not acne type three is Fus this is most common in men this is the one that you kind of be able to recognize it causes thickening of skin and it actually sometimes they get a bulbous nose and that's caused from excessive growth of tissue and then the fourth which only happens if you have one of the other types is ocular and this is when it starts affecting your eye dry eyes tearing burning gritty swollen Lids reoccurring sty all of those can happen if it gets into your eyes and so all of these things 2 through four four so unless you just have the most common one you need to see a dermatologist if you have four um obviously an optimalist obviously if over-the-counter things don't help you in a good four to 6 weeks then you're not seeing any Improvement um you need to see a dermatologist no matter what video is not meant to diagnose or treat just I'm going to share with you my own experiences with Ros some of you might have it and not even realize it just think you have a little bit of redness I truly saw so many results when I focused on some of these ingredients in my skincare regim so if you have like me multiple issues when it comes to your skin like you want to deal with aging and hyperpigmentation and acne and rosacea and all these things you always want to treat your sensitivity first get that under control before you start incorporating harsh actives to to kind of deal with other things and so this is why I feel like I'm always in that barrier strengthening kind of regimen um those barrier repair days are my favorite to calm my skin and to keep my barrier happy so that I can then incorporate a few days of those actives into my routine so the biggest thing is just avoiding irritating ingredients again you're going to have to exper experiment a little bit what is irritating for your skin cuz irritated me 5 years ago doesn't irritate my skin anymore because I have strengthen my barrier and I know what works for me but it's going to depend on you and how much skin care you've used how much you've experienced and obviously it's always going to be different than somebody else looking for calming products things that will strengthen our barriers treat your skin like it has a damaged barrier your rosacea will improve a lot of these ingredients kind of like overlap skin become more resilient and less reactive that's our goal so at minimum you can keep it very simple and just use a gentle non drying cleanser for your skin type now with rosacea it's not just a specific skin type any skin type from Oily to dry can be rosace can have rosacea and so you still want to pick something gentle non- stripping for your skin at minimum a good cleanser and I would recommend incorporating a toner or Essence if you haven't before something to soothe and calm this is something like the toners of past that are like witch witch hazel and alcohol strong astringent not that type we're talking soothing toner I've seen some of the biggest results by starting to incorporate what I used to think was a unneeded unnecessary step in my routine the it's now like my favorite because I see so many results from them so I'll show you some and then obviously a sunscreen so because our skin is going to be more affected by the Sun a sunscreen is a must now we all know that there's two different types of sunscreens on the market you'll hear them called mineral and chemical which is really inorganic and organic that are classified as mineral you're looking for the word titanium or zinc oxide those are the least sensitizing ingredients now if you've been following me a while you know my favorites are chemical sunscreens um I like uh the more elegant formulas the fact that it they have no white cast but my skin can tolerate them depending on how bad your rosacea is you might feel extremely inflamed when you try a chemical sunscreen and that's because chemicals can be more inzing to that type of skin um so you have to try it um if it works for you great you can use whatever I feel like so many people want to avoid chemical sunscreens for the wrong reasons the only reason you need to avoid one is it's if it is sensitizing your skin if it feels like it's burning if it's ever you know stinging or anything like that that's just causing more irritation and so the entire premise of a rosacea type regimen is to reduce inflammation because this is an inflammatory condition and that means inside the skin um so we're not exacerbating that problem right and then at night obviously some kind of moisturizer now it's got antioxidants and Skin Barrier repair ingredients even a lotos retinol has been shown to reduce inflammation all those things are really great no matter your skin so let's go over some of my favorite ingredients to include and some of my favorite products while I show you kind of my morning routine and ingredients to avoid for rosace first up we have cleansers now I already said stick with a non-drying gentle cleanser I can't stress that enough if your cleanser leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean it is too harsh for Rosa okay so some of my favorites is a myell water this is what I use every morning one specifically for sensitive skin I use this one and then there's also a sensitive skin one from Lage P um Now using it on a cotton round as long as that cotton round is not too scratchy cuz there are some cheap ones out there that are irritating to your barrier okay um you can even use a reusable microfiber cotton like type round um we also have those from saint that are made out of this material that I use in the mornings as well find as long as I use one for sensitive skin they give me no issues so if your skin um is not oily you don't have to do a full cleanse in the morning you can just use something like your water or a micelar say you're wearing makeup or your sunscreen which you should be every day um you could do totally do a double cleanse just with one cleanser or if you like using an oil cleanser I find most of my oil cleanser none of them are really super stripping and harsh there are some balms out there that might have exfoliant in them like enzymes that you can try um but if it's irritating look for an oil like the cintella one or I really love this new one I just started trying which is the lipar uh gentle foaming cleansing oil uh this one is for sensitive skin dry to Extra Dry if it's made for dry skin it's not going to be stripping of oils so that is always like a good clue um but this one has their thermal water shea butter ni camide I love the formulation because it goes on like an oil but then it actually SS up and it's a really cool formula so I've been using this one or I double cleanse with the famous glener so glycerin when we're talking hydrating and repairing glycerin is one of those Superstar ingredients okay it is a humectant and it is very good for sensitive skin this one also have has oat anything with oat is known to calm inflammation and redness and this one also has aloe I think we all know from being sunburnt as maybe a child that aloe is going to reduce redness so those are all great ingredients to look for this one I believe like in the studies they've shown that two weeks after this it has calmed people's rosacea like this I would say if you're looking for one cleanser you have rosacea you really want to see a difference this would be my Holy Grail status as far as a rosacea cleanser it is incredible 50% glycerin I've never seen a cleanser that has that much glycerin in it I'm a huge fan of Glycerin I think it's the it's my favorite humectant so highly recommend this one prequels line a lot of it you'll see me talking about because a lot of it um since it's dermatologist developed it has a lot of amazing ingredients specifically for uh rosacea and they even have like that little seal of approval if you go to their site and you'll see the rosacea Society seal of approval on a lot of their products um which is why I love so many of them they're all incredible for my problematic skin so you've got your very sensitive skin friendly soothing cleanser oh yeah and remember we don't want anything rough or abrasive um I threw away my Clarisonic years ago because it is like a breeding ground for bacteria even the most sensitive brush heads are just going to aggravate anyone's rosacea um so I switched everything to the soft microfiber cloth from Saint these are my favorite the gray ones they don't get dingy they W they wash normally in my laundry like I don't have to be um weird about like hanging them to dry or anything um I have one for every day of the week so I'm never reintroducing bacteria and are super soft and so I feel like I can because I can't Splash my face with water because of my lashes I can remove any cleanser with this and it never irritates my barrier so these are a must okay so in the morning I just use myell water water in evening double cleanse or double cleanse just with this guy game changer now like I said I learned the hard way physical exfoliation on my face always inflamed my skin just made my rosacea come out stronger so I avoid any abrasive scrubs meaning if it's got any kind of gritty particles in it no matter if they advertise them as micro beads or smooth or whatever the case may be I don't use them uh they don't work for me they are they doesn't matter they they're bad right so no physical exfoliation the only physical exfoliation I technically use is this which even though it's soft will give a little bit of exfoliation and then you guys have heard me talk about this so I'm blue in the face cure was my game Cher when I discovered I could get rid of the dead skin on my face without causing me to be more red so technically this is a physical exfoliant so it is a peeling gel if you've never used one they're extremely gentle but you put it on dry skin you rub it around and it kind of rolls up the dead skin inside these little polymers and those polymers though like is the physical exfoliant that is actually like getting the dead skin off like I can completely get it all and I come out and I'm not even red I don't know what magical sorcery it is it's science what can I say but um appealing gel was a game changer I've tried quite a few over the years and this is still my holy gra I recommend your first on your journey to like controlling your rosacea avoiding high percentage vitamin C's retinoids like prescription strength retinoids like tretinoin and high strength peels like glycolic based High percentages every once in a while you you'll notice if you use one you might feel that little tingly a little bit um irritated the next day your skin will be more red okay until your barrier is really like resilient and ready for that I recommend kind of stopping those and sticking to very gentle forms right all of those things have um not as strong strengths right so my recommendation for an exfoliant I love this one because I feel like I can use it more than just once a week and I swear it's the only thing that like I my nose is my biggest thing like it will make my nose just feel so smooth and like decongested I don't know what like every day if I use it the day before it's like the next day I am glow glowy and my nose isn't red but is like this is like my problem area as far as like clogged pores it like keeps them cleared out um it is the pressing glow by medicate um it's a daily exfoliant PHA tonic with enzyme activator okay so enzymes are gentle exfoliants but PHA those polyhydroxy acids are the gentlest of all the ahas I would say look out for phas phas are going to be your best friend you'll be able to use them without that irritation factor and so when my skin is a little bit sensitive I stop everything else and I will just go for this I am obsessed with this one right um even dermaplaning I would say would it be would be my most irritating routine I still do so when I use like a razor and get off peach fuzz at home dermaplaning there's kind of no avoiding you can create like a barrier by using an oil down fur so it's not as exfoliating but you're putting a blade against your skin and taking off hair like that manual removal of dead skin is it always makes me red and so just know if that is a trigger for you like for me right afterwards I use all of these really calming ingredients and I let my skin recover for a couple days like I know that's just part of my routine now so let's get into toners you guys know I have an obsession with toners now so me trying to pick the best ones was hard I would say one of the best um calming ingredients great for rosacea is I've talked about it before hypochlorous acid it can kind of calm and help your barrier so I use this one all the time from prequel again great for sensitized reaction reactive prone skin which is kind of realization in a nutshell right so I spray this all over and then I usually go in with the toner there's so many so many great calming toners most of them are K Beauty I'll be honest they make the best calming toners on the market I feel like Western skincare is starting to get there but um a is one of my favorite the heart leaf is known to be a very soothing ingredient and so it's also got loaded with a lot of other great things like glycerin and panthenol that are good for your barrier as well so these are kind of like the same thing one's in a pad form one's just where you can put it in your hand Splash it on your face I also really love the Haru Haru Wonder this black uh rice one um but I get the one for sensitive skin okay wi in doubt go for the sensitive Peach slices is one of the best lines they actually have an entire line called redness relief that is amazing because all of it will work for um calming rosacea but this one is literally snail we know the how calming snail um is got hyaluronic acid which is humectant and my favorite ingredient cintella which I'll get to more in a minute so this one is a good choice as well I have a lot of toners that would work for this but if I had to pick one I'd probably go with the heart leaf just because it is known to be the most soothing and I notice when I use it it does calm my redness down right away get into a little bit of more of like the nitty-gritty ingredients to look for remember we're thinking sensitive gentle hydrating barrier repair all those things so think high in glycerin camide like green tea aloe oatmeal arnica pantholops going to be cintella asiatica you guys are probably sick of hearing me talk about it but I know so many of you have responded that it has done wonders for your skin as well when I discovered this I noticed an immediate difference in the level of my redness and so this will always be a Holy Grail this is the skin 10104 ampule this is just pure cintella once I discovered this I realized how much it's another things like it's in this and a lot of these products I'm about to show you because it is like this Superstar ingredient that is great at soothing and calming inflammation in the skin so it is an anox here called sea or Tiger's grass there are a lot of lines that are purely around cintella that they make entire like this line is all cintella and all of it like I've tried the cleansing oil I've shown you guys a lot of it all of it is really good it also increases collagen which is one of the reasons why I like to use it cuz I feel like it not only improves your skin hydration and it heals your skin and is great for barrier strengthening but it increases collagen which is an anti-aging ingredient so it's one of the few anti-age ingredients besides I'd say like peptides that you can use with anything and it doesn't it's not going to inflame your rosacea it's not too strong or irritating or anything like that it's just super star so the next one might not be a surprise even though I just said don't use high strength vitamin C vitamin C is one of the best ingredients because it's an antioxidant it's will strengthen your capillaries okay so it's going to cause less redness it'll improve that like flushing of your face over time but it also repairs barrier and it balances bacteria now the thing is I noticed on my own skin if I use those high percent percentage 20% ascorbic acid um I've had to kind of like build my Skin's tolerance up to being able to use something like that um but when my skin is kind of irritated maybe my barrier is a little um not as resilient from just like dermal planning the next the day before or something like that I skip the strong percentages and I go in with something like this which is um a vitamin C derivative okay so this one is a new discovery but it's one of my favorite because this is one of the most soothing amazing formulations now I've raved about beauty of Josie in so many times but this one is literally 68% cintella um which which I just went over and then it's got a vitamin C derivative which those derivatives have to be converted to ascorbic acid once they get in your skin which means they're less irritating so if you are looking for those benefits of vitamin C but you don't you're not ready for that pure ascorbic acid which it straight up stings when I use it a lot of times um that's when I go in with one like this so another favorite this one is also a vitamin C derivative it's called it's Coco kind's vitamin C glow serum and I like this one because it is a derivative as well but it has the next ingredient which I'm going to go over which is azelaic acid so this one is kind of like a twoin one if you're looking to get both of those benefits I would recommend this guy but AIC acid you've probably seen it I've tried many different formulations it is something that they actually will prescribe if you go to a dermatologist they will give you aoic acid for rosacea now prescription strength is 15% so you have to go to a dermatologist to get that usually so a lot of times you'll find it in 10% but it can it can still be beneficial the cool thing about azoic acid is it is a really good like gentle exfoliant at the same time you get it with some of these things all in one so like this is a vitamin C derivative with AIC acid in it this one from nutum is uh also has a vitamin C in it um so it helps it says congestion redness dullness and discoloration it is a very multi-purpose product but it also balances bacteria redness inflammation that mild exfoliant will help Target those bumps and enlarged pores that we sometimes get here from Rosia um and it will smooth the skin because of that exfoliant properties so this one is one of the most high-end ones I've ever used it's an amazing formulation it's called Ando It Is by Anisa and it's a 10% um AIC and the PHA serum so it's got added PHA in it it feels amazing so one of the bad things about aoic acid is it can be a little bit trickier for chemist to formulate with and so a lot of times it can be um an ingredient that leads to pilling when you layer it with other products um once you put your sunscreen on it can peel underneath um this one does not it is amazing formula and this one is becoming one of my favorites it's one of the best formulations I've ever seen I don't know how they somehow got a 15% as a like in this one so this is theramed it also has codal oatmeal which oatmeal colloidal oatmeal is one of the best for soothing redness this is it's not a serum it's more of like a lotion um almost like a moisturizer type situation I don't know how but it's one of the best some of the other formulations of AIC acid might be a little gritty um this is a serum again it's a little bit lowerer percentage but so if rosacea is like what you're looking to control I would add an aoic acid in your reg now I almost didn't like mention the next one because let's be honest it's in everything like here you go niacinamide this one's AAL acid niacinamide vitamin C okay this has got all three niacinamide we all know it's an anti-inflammatory antioxidant repairs the Skin Barrier it's in probably 90% of your product so do you need an additional niacinamide most likely no just read your ingredient labels um but it is really good for just kind of all over strengthening now it can be in in some things too high of a percentage so if you can look at the percentage like you don't need 10% that could be very irritating for rosacea skin look for more like 2 to 5% now if it is like in something like this it's not probably at a high percentage because it is a combination product but if you have a separate niacinamide product you don't need a 10% couple of bonus serums just because I feel like they're so good um here's another beauty of Jos one this one is a calming serum this is one of the ones I've been testing but it is green tea and panol which are two of the best calming type serums I like this one because I can easily kind of put it under other ones if I need a little bit more like if I'm feeling a little flushed already like my cheeks are feeling warm that morning I'll grab something like this to like instantly calm green tea aloe panol all of those are really good for that redness and inflammation just an all encompassing kind of soothing serum great for strengthening your barrier if you don't have a barrier serum in Your Arsenal I would recommend this one and it's really fun so this is the hot pink ordinary um soothing and barrier support serum this is pretty much got everything that we've been talking about in it even more lipids vitamins like things that will repair your barrier if it gets inflamed which if you have rosacea you naturally going to have a more sensitive barrier so having something like this is really going to help you out and then we've got a new launch um at least it's only been out for a couple weeks I think it came out when I was in Mexico and I it's really good of course it's good it's from prequel and it's made for redness um I knew as soon as I saw the launch I was like I have to have that so this is the redness reform soothing serum so many of the ingredients I've already talked about arnica oat glycerin aloe beta glucan um it's literally meant for restoring a bearer and reducing redness I love the formulation because it's this I I don't know what it is give me milky toners and really like soothing serums that are like gel like they instantly kind of absorb you instantly get that cooling factor and I feel like as somebody with kind of Flushed hot skin the cooling this is so good so I'm still testing this cuz it hasn't been out for long but when it comes to talking about rosace it most definitely would be a serum I'd recommend trying okay and then real quick if we're talking like nighttime regimens we've got our soothing serums what if we still want to incorporate a retinoid product if you have never used a retinoid before I would recommend starting off with a really low dose because like I said um retinol is shown to reduce inflammation in the skin and so something like this Co Coco kinds this is their beginner retinol gel now it's a little um misleading because it says it's a. 1% but it's a tri retinoid complex because it has um both retinol a Time released retinal and a grand active retinoid so it's got three different kinds very low percentages um but what I love about it is that it also has aloe and cintella so it's going to kind of calm at the same time so if you are a rosacea person and you want to use a retinoid this is by far the best formulated it's not going to irritate your skin because it's like so low it's still going to show results over time and when it comes to retinoid low and slow don't like starting off too high is only going to cause irritation and make your skin go backwards and it's going to cause inflammation and your redness is going to come out so low and slow this is the one I would choose now if you're like okay Sarah I've used a really low one for a really long time my rosace is under control I have a really strong barrier that's when I would say move up to a retinal um the M love has a retinal the Moonlight serum um this beautiful yellow bright yellow serum and then I'd say if you want the best results and you're like not not ready for Tre you guys I'll be honest I don't know if I'll ever be able to use TR Nan again I've tried it before my rosacea skin does not like it and that's okay and I'm totally okay with that because I'm still going to get results from using a retin alahh they're my favorite so the crystal retinals line from medicate I like because it's got a lot of different dosages and you can start really slow I'm at the 10 level right now um you I I believe it's is it like one three six 10 I can't even remember all the numbers but once you go through a bottle you'll be able to move up to the next one and so it kind of forces you to go low and slow and like not jump too quickly to the next and immediately have that irritation that we all know retinoids will give you moisturizers I feel like a lot of times you just have to pick something that works for your skin type if you're already focusing on all of these great ingredients focus on glycerin and ceramides um and you'll be good for sensitive skin those are always the best so for daytime I like this Vana cream it's simple it's loaded in ceramides and hyaluronic acid it is free of so many things that can cause irritation and it's made for sensitive skin and it's silicone free for under Saint so this would be my choice I also really love the snail cream again we love the snail mucin it is so good for kind of just calming irritation and keeping that barrier intact and then what helped my skin originally was just the saint cream um something about the milk I think is what really calmed my skin honey a very low do retinoid cuz it's got retinal palmitate which is a derivative very low dose um honey petrolatum because it is is that petrum base it kind of holds in that moisture and it is really good for barrier repair so this will always be my r or Dye um but I'd say if you want something else that is just really good for barrier lots of free fatty acids and um ceramides I would definitely say instant Angel by do is also one of my holy Grails just an all-encompassing really really good moisturizer free of anything that's going to cause you any irrit which is always good and then last but not least I'm going to share some mineral sunscreens for those of you who maybe are still in that sensitive part can't use chemical filters or organic filters and need an inorganic so prequel has one now it's really good um it's kind of got like a pink undertone um it is a zinc oxide you see that but I love it because it really like gives you a nice glowy finish um and it does go in with no white cast which is what's so hard to find when it comes to Mineral um and so it also has uh I can never say this word visol which is um a good soothing ingredient also for red skin I really like this um for a mineral sunscreen this on no makeup days because it does have a silicone in it but these are my two favorite mineral choices that are silicone free so the Coco kind daily SPF this one takes a little bit longer to rub in it's got a little bit more of a white cast um and then the dream Beam by kosas um it has a lot of great soothing ingredients as well cuz it's got peptides ceramides hyaluronic acid allantoin but this one does pill if you put too much skin care under it so just know that um at least it pills on me if I layer it with too much so I would say stick to really like thin watery textures maybe only one serum um for mornings if you're using this honorable mention is always going to be some kind of um treatment and caast which is based off cantella asiatica um this is a dimethicone skin protectant it's got shea butter again cantella vitamin B5 this would be like something I would say your barriers inflamed this is kind of like a Holy Grail status at this point um cult favorite at night after all your skin care just putting like a psize amount all over is kind of like to lock it all in and heal your barrier overnight it's so good so this will really reduce redness for a rosacea Seer all right I think I covered all the Skin Care let's talk makeup really quick now you guys see me put on my makeup all the time I always use 3D Foundation when it comes to my color corrector but I'm always asked about and redness okay so if you don't know the difference I've got lots of videos I can share down below my two cents when it comes to redness if you have rosaceous if you have a type of redness you know fluctuates if somebody tells me on their color match form that they have a red they have rosacea I will not recommend Demi for rosacea and here's why Demi is a precise application you don't want to take something for redness which is usually in the yellow orange category across a large area you would have to pinpoint with a precise brush and actually kind of color correct every single one of those little broken capillaries and yes it works but it's timec consuming you can't just take a big fluffy brush and put it across your face without it showing texture you'll see the texture you'll see where it won't lay nicely on your skin and that's because you're also touching that color to not your broken capillaries if that makes sense so also Demi is not really for beginners it is um a little bit harder to learn you have to be willing to master it as well and if your redness fluctuates here's what I found if you put this on an area of your face and then say later in the day you go outside and it flushes and gets brighter guess what if you color corrected it to that level cuz you have to choose how deep it is based on what it is at that moment if when it fluctuates it no longer will be covered it comes right back out and so this is why when you tell me of rosacea I will pick a corrector that I know will work even as your redness fluctuates during the day okay and so this is why I use magic mango I probably always will because I know it's got me covered depending on how dark my redness gets if it's light or if it gets inflamed it's going to color correct it if you have rosace you don't have a color corrector I will link my color match uh questionnaire down below I can definitely help you I have matched many people like me that's got redness problem I'm telling you it's a game Cher once you get a corrector that works now I wanted to kind of experiment real quick and show you guys one of my newest discoveries for redness now I will be honest I haven't tried this under makeup yet but I've seen someone use it under makeup I think I even checked it it doesn't have I checked no silicon it actually is like classified as like a skin care corrector it has glycerin niacinamide but the main ingredient is niacinamide at 2% and it Hasen seaweed extract which makes it this green color and I'll be honest I didn't know if it was really going to work I'm going to show you what it does so this is going to this is my new go-to for no makeup day so I have no makeup on right now sometimes it bothers me how like red my chin just my chin gets and like my broken capillaries right here and a little bit on my cheeks and the first time I tried this I was flored because I typically think of like a green color corrector like Demi and if I try to use Demi in this way it does not look pretty it doesn't sit well it looks like it's just sitting in my pores and shows all the texture but let me just show you this is just like green skin care right so I'm just going to take a fluffy brush now if you over apply you'll see the green but if you keep it light-handed look at that can you tell how I was like floored it's by typology I will link it down below so I and and this is like my my problem area right here like broken capillaries and I was like oh this is definitely going to show texture right because that is an area of my face it's just an area of everyone's face that shows so much texture and I'm just amazed at how well this sits on skin and it doesn't look like makeup I probably should have like not dotted on the other side it doesn't look like it doesn't look like anything is on your skin because it's classified as like not makeup it's classified as a corrector and let me tell you no makeup days now I have noticed if I widely fluctuate like on one of those days I'm telling you like my redness oh doesn't help when I have a coughing fit and my full face just turned red again oh man but besides that this does an amazing job and it doesn't take much at all and I've used my fingers too it says you can press on with fingers I kind of like the blending ability of the brush actually better with it so far I don't know if you guys can tell a difference but I certainly can so a few times I've used this and then done a little bit of Demi under my eyes and to me that was a game changer because Demi was always too timec consuming to get rid of my redness so if I was just using Demi I could get rid of like my dark spot and like around my eyes and a little bit around my nose but it would always give me texture issues here and there's no texture with this product really good I'm high impressed so t33 by typology and I'm also just have to say this company is made in France I don't know where their warehouse is though like I always order and get stuff within a day or two it's like Amazon fast which just makes me want to order from them more because I hate shipping times right so it kind of reminds me of if you've heard of Dr jart has a seea Paar line which is like kind of green tinged and it's like skin care that is color correcting at the same time but I've checked in like literally every single product from them I've wanted to try it all has a lot of silicone in it and this one didn't have any so I was like sold I have to try it and I am so impressed I'm so impressed so okay that's all I got my redness has improved so much over the last few years of just kind of learning what skin care to use and how to take care of my skin like this is what I looked like before my rosacea started coming out at like 34 6 7 years later I feel like all right I know what to look for I know what ingredients and that's what I want to teach you guys what ingredients do you need to look for in order to kind of control it because it is something that takes consistency you can't just use these products once rosacea there's no cure but it can be alleviated you can control the symptoms um and they don't have to show them on your face right and I'm also not saying I use all of these products every single day a lot of these are Staples in my routine um when My Skin Barrier is not feeling very resilient I reduce my actives and really increase my barrier repair calming soothing type products and then pay attention to your skin and you really get to know it you will know when to kind of add back in those activ and kind of pull these back until your skin needs it always trying to keep a healthy barrier you will be good and your redness will be controlled that doesn't mean the Heat and all those lifestyle triggers we talked about aren't going to still happen but when they occur you know which skin care to reach for as always I will link up everything I talked about down below the video if you have any questions on rosacea or skincare ingredients just let me know down in the comments below if you're needing a color match for 3D that link will also be down below and I will put it in the pin comment as always thank you guys so much for being here and watching love you bye",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video I'm going to share with you a simple straightforward effective skincare routine for clearing up blackheads white heads acne breakouts and for rosacea and that really stubborn cousin of rosacea perioral dermatitis this is a really easy routine anybody can do it doesn't require a lot of advanced thinking planning layering give this video a thumbs up if you like simple straightforward No Nonsense skincare routines that don't require like a lot of advanced thinking planning tons of products cluttering your shell I'm going to be using one of my favorite ingredients it's very underrated it's sulfur in the de la Cru maximum strength acne treatment this is a 10% sulfur mask I'm going to show you how to use it and while I do it I'm going to explain how it works what the benefits are and what to expect you want to get started by first washing your face you can just use a mild gentle cleanser I'm using this one by Neutrogena a favorite of mine the hydroboost with hyaluronic acid hydrating Gel Cleanser fragrance-free importantly when you wash your face always make sure to use lukewarm to Cool Water using really hot water not only can dry out the skin but actually can be really aggravating to conditions like rosacea and perioral dermatitis you want to make sure to pat dry the skin if your skin is soaking wet this product is probably not going to set up as as well now that my skin is clean and there's no water residue left on the surface this product is going to go on a lot more evenly a lot more smoothly to use this you just need about a pearl sized amount and you're going to apply a thin film to the face now I'm going to put it to my entire face sparing around my eyes common mistake people make when it comes to Skin Care is putting on a big glob all you really need is a very thin film of this it has a very moisturizing texture make sure to get my nose cheek area so as soon as you've applied this in a thin film to the entire face sparing the area around your eyes you're going to set a timer for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes I'll go ahead and do 15 while the timer is going we're going to talk about what what exactly this is doing what it's helpful for what to expect sulfur why would you want to use that in a skincare routine it has a lot of benefits for the skin if you weren't aware it's anti-inflammatory and it's antimicrobial it can help reduce the acne causing bacteria cutie bacterium acnes and it can also help control certain microbes on the skin surface that can aggravate conditions like rosacea your skin has these little mites hello kind of freaks people out they're called Demodex mites but in Ros part of the skin problem where you get these inflamed red spots is thought to be due to an abnormal response to those little mites and sulfur can actually help with that sulfur is also chotic meaning it basically unclogs pores it does this because the sulfur is thought to interact with cysteine the amino acid and the keratins in your skin helping to basically break up the glue between cells that are kind of stuck together in your pore the benefit of doing that is unclogging pores so you can see Improvement in blackheads and white heads otherwise known as open and closed comeone so for example if you get a lot of Comey dones on your forehead this may help you out if you get a lot of blackheads on your nose this is something to consider because sulfur is both anti-inflammatory and because it can help reduce the burden of the acne causing bacterium cutie bacterium acnes this can be a particularly valuable mask to consider incorporating into your skincare routine if you have acne whether it be acne that is predominant L hormonal maybe predominantly localized to the jawline maybe you have comedonal acne that's aggravated by hair styling products on your forehead and you're trying to clear that up or maybe you have acne on your body like your chest or your back you don't have to just do this to the face this product can help with those things sulfur is really underrated by and large some of the things I really like about sulfur and this mask in particular are that it's pretty easy to tolerate it's very gentle on the skin I mean it's well tolerated by by people who have the sensitive skin condition rosacea I also like that this product can be used alongside other treatments what we're doing here in this routine is essentially a form of short contact therapy what is short contact therapy essentially what it sounds like putting an active ingredient on the skin leaving it there for a defined period of time and then rinsing it off the advantages of short contact therapy are that you get the ingredient on the skin you derive the benefits but you minimize any side effects of dryness that's what we're doing here I've got a lot of videos talking about short contact therapy on this channel whether it be with troan or other acne ingredients like benzol peroxide so check those out but today we're basically doing a form of short contact therapy in contrast to some of those other active ingredients that we've talked about with short contact therapy though I want to emphasize that sulfur is pretty gentle on the skin it's actually kind of soothing the main side effects of using the sulfur mask are it can be drying some people find their skin itches when they use it and probably the thing that bothers people the most is the odor some people find that it smells like rotting eggs other people note that it smells like a match head basically the smell of sulfur now we're going to rinse this off the skin surface in my opinion I don't smell any residual sulfur odor using this product after I rinse it off but I have gotten comments over the years from people who are like I use that and every time I use it my husband or partner they tell me that my face smells like eggs so just a word of warning it can leave a foul odor on the skin surface that a lot of people don't care for but as I mentioned you can use it alongside other active ingredients it doesn't counteract other active ingredients and because it's relatively gentle overall I mean it may be a little drying but overall it's pretty gentle you can use it alongside other active ingredients for either acne rosacea perioral dermatitis for example in the case of acne you could use this mask rinse it off as we're going to do in a moment and you'll see see me do that you can rinse it off and then you can use your other acne treatments whether it be bzal peroxide troin aoic acid um topical dapsone you can also use treatments for rosacea along with this whether be topical icin which is sold by the brand named cilantro or topical metronidazol this is not going to get in the way of that it's gentle enough that you can actually do this on a daily basis comment below have you ever dealt with a bout of peroral dermatitis otherwise known as per orificial dermatitis it can be very frustrating and uncomfortable as the name implies often involves the skin around the mouth although it can involve the skin around the nose and around the eyes periorificial dermatitis is notoriously difficult to tackle head on and majority of skincare products actually end up irritating that condition but sulfur is something that is prudent to consider in the routine to address that condition again it is thought to be related to rosace the anti-inflammatory properties of sulfur are what is thought to be responsible for improvement in periorificial dermatitis with sulfur so in summary benefits that you might observe with a product like this are fewer breakouts fewer blackheads fewer white heads in the case of rosacea fewer papules which are those red bumps fewer pules which are those white pus fill bumps similarly with periorificial dermatitis you may note Improvement in the number of red bumps that you get with that condition and an overall just Improvement in the sensitivity that you experience with those little bumps if you've ever had that again those bumps they can sting and be really uncomfortable what if you don't have acne rosacea or periorificial dermatitis can this still be helpful certainly can it's chotic properties can help improve the appearance of pores does this have any anti-aging properties to it no there's nothing about this that combats skin aging how often can you do this mask you can do it as often as you tolerate it you actually can do it on a daily basis either as part of your morning skincare routine or part of your evening skincare routine and truthfully if you're motivated you can do it two to three times a day as tolerated so what I suggest is that try using it once a day for the first couple of weeks see how you do with it if it's too drying maybe go to using it every other day but if you tolerate it fine consider increasing it to using it twice a day by increasing the number of times a day that you use it you may note that that you get a faster onset of improvement of things like red bumps pules blackheads and white heads again everything in the skin takes time but by increasing the frequency as tolerated you may know that you get to those results faster than doing it at a more conservative Pace now if you'll recall from my video on short contact therapy one of the things I really like about it is that it gives the individual a lot of control and tweaking the duration of contact you can start out really conservative leaving this on on the skin surface for 10 minutes and then increase the duration of contact you may find that initially you only tolerate wearing it for 10 minutes and that it's too drying but with time you are able to tolerate it better outwards to 15 and 20 minutes and then again increasing from just using it once a day a few times a week to daily to twice a day I mean really it's going to be something that you can guide people who have drier skin maybe are more sensitive those that tend to be more on the rosaceous side of things they may find they have to be more conservative whereas people who have really inflamed acne they may find that they need to be a bit more aggressive and use it more frequently the spots of acne they can be quite thickened and so the penetration of this can be a little slow in those areas so by using it more frequently you may get to the end point that you're looking for faster okay now that the 15 minutes are up I'm going to rinse this off the skin surface something really nice about this product is you don't don't need to use cleanser to rinse it off the skin it's water soluble meaning it'll come off with water now you certainly can use a gentle cleanser if you find that that works for you I would suggest though just using water because the more times you wash your face with a cleanser that can end up drying out your skin too much and as I said sulfur can be a little drying to begin with and again cool to lukewarm water we're not going to go boiling the stratum corium here all right so now that I've rinse that off we're going to come in with the final step of this very simple straightforward routine and that is to apply a moisturizer if this is part of your evening routine or a moisturizing sunscreen if this is part of your daytime routine doesn't matter what the product is so long as you like it and it doesn't bother your skin I'm using the hadot amuji skin conditioning gel by nuturi this is a really lightweight hydrating gel it's beneficial in that it's going to replenish any moisture that I lost from washing my face and it's going to help keep the Skin Barrier protected and hydrated to minimize any potential drying side effects from The sulfur mask with moisturizer you only need a nickel to Dime sized amount again you don't need a big glob on there of course it's going to depend a bit on the consistency of the moisturizer that you're using so you can always add a little bit more if you feel that you need to but you don't need to go on in with a big glob from the get-go it just will end up wasting things now if I were doing this as part of my morning routine I would pat dry the skin completely and I would come in with a moisturizing sunscreen if you guys missed my video on the pure screen Plus Mineral tinted sunscreens from Neutrogena definitely check those out but these would be a great option if you have especially if you have very sensitive skin they're mineral sunscreens they're less likely to sting and burn in comparison to the All chemical sunscreen and you have four different shades to choose from there so that would be a great option okay where do you get this Dayla Cru sulfur oy you can get it a lot of places it can be a little hard to find cuz they sometimes put it like down at the bottom shelf but you can buy it at Walmart you can buy it at Kroger grocery stores I've seen uh Target you can also get it at like Walgreens r a CVS or you can get it on the Amazonian so it's pretty inexpensive and you don't need a lot of this you also as I mentioned earlier in the video You could also use this product to like the chest the back anywhere where you have breakouts this could be used and it can be helpful it can be used under the arms too if you find that you get painful breakouts there maybe related to hyro adenitis you may find that this is beneficial in those areas it can be very soothing and anti-inflammatory can this product be used if you were pregnant always discuss that with your treating healthcare provider but by and large sulfur is is considered to be safe to use in pregnancy can you use a sulfur mask if you are allergic to sulfa s u LFA the answer is yes sulfur is not the same as sulfa sulfa is a class of antibiotics that some people are allergic to but this does not crossreact with that okay I'm going to wrap this video up here I really hope that this was helpful to you guys straightforward effective three-step routine for acne rosacea paroral dermatitis really anyone could benefit from this routine if you're looking to incorporate sulfur in for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits um now on the end slate I'm going to link my video on how to do short contact therapy with benzo peroxide it's a great way to use benzol peroxide for your acne derive the benefits of that ingredient but minimize the drying effects benzo peroxide in contrast to sulfur can be a lot more drying and irritating so watch that one next especially if you're coping with acne breakouts but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] h [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning my little nerds i am dr shireen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city welcome to my youtube channel please feel free to like subscribe and comment below i definitely try to read through all the comments on saturday and sunday once the video is published and hopefully i will get to your comment question request in the next video so today i decided to tackle this a little bit differently and focus on sensitive skin maybe because i'm feeling a little sensitive these days going through construction on an office sucks and there's no better way to put it and i find myself tearing up or crying at a drop of a pin so i thought i would empathize with all my sensitive soul skin people out there and do a video just for you so in this video we're going to cover the basics as to what is sensitive skin what to look out for and a couple of my favorite products on the market in each category that would be best geared and suited for you so sensitive skin the way i look at patients who come in with sensitive skin is the way i felt when i was pregnant walking into a very fancy restaurant or a sushi restaurant where everything was there at my disposal but i was not allowed to eat it and i feel for people with sensitive skin because they probably walk into a walmart ulta sephora target and basically see all the skin care and feel very limited and trapped because they're too scared to approach any of them so i see you and i feel for you because it sucks people with sensitive skin tend to experience redness inflammation dryness stinging burning itching and even acne breakouts pretty much everything and the reason why they tend to react so much more profoundly is because their skin barrier is not as strong and as intact as somebody with quote unquote normal skin or even oily skin and so they need to approach any new product that they put on their face very gingerly very cautiously and really allow themselves the time to see if that product works for them and really gets to see how their skin responds and that's why i always say get to know your skin before you decide to jump in and incorporate 20 new skin care products in your skincare routine overnight because your skin will freak the f out it will go all right it just will not work i also want to say that oftentimes i find it amusing when i'm reading skin care product reviews online whether it's sephora or alta or target or whatever and i he and i read this product made my skin get really really red and inflamed it sucked i'm sorry to break it to you but maybe the product didn't suck it just sucked for you it's one of those it's not me it's you or it's not you it's me situations the product itself is what it is but if you're somebody who's very sensitive maybe it sucked for you that's just something to keep in mind especially as you are becoming a more well-versed skincare consumer and you're reading these reviews online about products at least this way you're becoming more aware as to what you know you take it with a grain of salt and you kind of see if it applies so what exactly is the difference between sensitive skin versus sensitized skin sensitive skin is as we just described somebody who has you know these sort of propensities to reacting or becoming inflamed or red or breaking out or whatever it is to various different ingredients that are not specific sensitized skin means you're now reactive to a very specific ingredient because your skin is sensitized to that ingredient so you've developed an allergy specifically against this ingredient not everybody with sensitive skin becomes sensitized the likelihood yes is higher but it doesn't mean that you're going to become all of a sudden sensitized to all fragrances and that's why i always laugh at how everybody exes out fragrances obviously if you have sensitive skin probably avoid but somebody like myself has normal skin doesn't need to avoid fragrance but that is the difference between sensitive and sensitized and once you're sensitized in a very twisted way it's almost kind of like a blessing very twisted way because now you know that you need to avoid that one ingredient and you know just never to use it so you can then look out for products that doesn't contain it and how to discover if you actually have sensitized skin it's by going to an allergist or a dermatologist and getting patch tested not prick tested patch tested where they put patches to see if your skin has developed an allergic reaction to an allergen what are the common and i'm going to say one two three let's keep going four ish five ish things to look for or to try to avoid if you have baseline sensitive skin and i'm going to lead this with what i just talked about fragrance i think it's important to try to minimize your risk of becoming sensitized to different ingredients fragrances can cause a lot of reactions and if you're somebody who's super super sensitive you probably want to look for something without fragrance the caveat is fragrance can be masked as anything it's not like you look at the ingredient list and it's written fragrance you know like even lolita there's no ingredient list printed on this it's not brilliant fragrance it could be masked as essential oils which obviously contain fragrances there's an ingredient called balsam of peru which is a very very famous fragrance that is put in a lot of skincare products there is also perfume or i don't know how you perfume parfait whatever that is basically another word for fragrance because it's usually a proprietary concoction of different scents so you're not necessarily going to find fragrance in the ingredient list so you have to know what you're looking out for number two alcohol alcohol is a really bad rep and it doesn't deserve it there's different types of alcohols there's denatured alcohols okay and those are basically alcohol denate or what's it called sd but those are not fatty alcohols the reason i say avoid those types of denatured alcohols is because you're trying to put chances on your side it's kind of like with fragrances alcohols are used in formulations to enhance penetrations of other actives it can be a little bit stripping and drying and so if you have a compromised skincare skin barrier you're obviously going to approach a little bit with caution but again i don't want you guys to freak out it's not all alcohols are created equal and one day we're going to do a deep dive into alcohol in another video but that's just something to kind of keep in mind if you're on the extreme end of sensitive skin third foaming washes things with sodium lauryl sulfate and i it's a i'm getting a lisp sls but those are things you also want to avoid because those can be over stripping like i said causing a compromised skin barrier making your sensitivities worse and finally tingling agents any kind of cream that you see that says cooling sensation probably has menthol peppermint in it and those can be very very very um reactive to your skin you can kind of do a small test by looking at your toothpaste if you're somebody has super sensitive skin when you brush your teeth with any kind of mint toothpaste you can see if you know you're developing sort of reactions around your mouth that can be kind of a like a very easy poor man's test to see if you're reactive to it and last if you are a super nerd and if you have the time to look into the ph of certain formulations you want to avoid cleansers with very very high ph because that can be over stripping and again compromise your skin barrier so how do we know then which products you want to incorporate in our routine i think it's pretty simple approach with caution test a small area in front of your ear out or even right here underneath your ear do that every day for a week to see how your skin responds because it's not necessarily going to respond with the first go-around and then see how you like the product and if it works and you're okay use it all over your face but do that for at least one to two weeks before incorporating something new it's tedious it's time consuming it's emotionally draining i am not disagreeing with you but your skin will thank you in the long run all right now claims what are the claims we want to look for when we are trying to find products with sensitive skin you want to see things that are formulated for sensitive skin like this product right here i can never do this by vanity cream all right so number two you want to look for fragrance free claims not unscented unscented like certain soap bars actually has a chemical in there that masks the scent so you don't look for unscented it is not the same as fragrance free there are two separate claims they are not the same so you want to look for fragrance free a third little tidbit if you see this label by the eczema association it's probably something that's better suited for you as well four you want to look for things that are hypoallergenic sort of like your comforter for your bed think of it as comforter for your face hypoallergenic is always going to be better and five anti-redness products cannot claim to calm inflammation otherwise it'd be considered like drugs and it has to have a drug claim on them so a lot of skin care products over the counter use words like soothing calming redness reducing anti-redness as code word for sensitive skin so that's just something for you guys to think of and to look out for and so you just need to make sure that you are really reading between those lines let's jump in quickly to some of my favorite roundups of products starting with cleansers i love this guy i never ever ever not bring vana cream up i think it is a great cleanser for sensitive skin it is free of pretty much everything masking fragrance like we talked about for unscented lanolin which is a wool alcohol found in aquaphor not vaseline um i don't care about the parabens but parabens fine other preservatives dyes formaldehyde etc it is really really gentle almost too gentle if you're somebody who wears heavy makeup you're definitely going to need to load up on another step for a double cleanse because it's not going to be enough which leads me to this the bioderma micellar water this is the sense bio h2o i like this one a lot because it is formulated for sensitive skin it does not contain fragrance whereas a lot of other french products do and i think that it is extremely extremely um it's hypoallergenic and it is extremely gentle so the combination of this and this does the job if you're wearing as much makeup as like i am currently which is a very light under eye concealer um i put a little bit of powder on my eyes eyebrow pen eyeliner and mascara so this these two are actually great for a light makeup day all right and then third everybody talks about you know cerave's hydrating cleanser it's nice because it's ceramide infused and you definitely want to use ceramides to help to restore your skin barrier moving on to serums i love a good hydrating serum but most of them on the market contain hyaluronic acid if you have sensitive skin i would strongly urge that you watch my ha video and try to cut it out code words for hyaluronic acid in the ingredient list are sodium hyaluronate and a nice alternative is this one by aveeno i've been speaking about this one a lot it is the calm and restore triple o serum it is extremely calming and soothing especially if you have eczema and it is really nicely geared towards sensitive skin so if you're looking for a hydrating serum i would strongly urge that you guys look into this one the one downfall is this dropper socks it is probably one of the worst droppers i've ever used on the market you guys can flip it out for a pump head um i've posted a video on it on tiktok one day i'll do a video here for you guys a second serum i really like is dr jart's sick appear serum the reason i like this one and i haven't opened this particular bottle i just bought this is because it has sentella asiatica and sentella is a great ingredient as i'm struggling to open this where are my scissors i don't have scissors so sentella is a great ingredient to help reduce redness it cannot say that it treats redness or it's anti-inflammatory but know that it is it isn't the same similar style dropper as the aveeno but i will say the quality of this dropper is you know you cannot compare it to the dropper of the aveeno one it is light green in color which helps to counteract the redness that usually is appearance with sensitive skin or rosacea but i love this serum i think it is beautiful it definitely helps to repair and soothe dry skin especially sensitive skin and it is one that i recommend quite often to my own patients so that is sick a pair moving on to exfoliants i think exfoliants have gone a little bit wild i love a good chemical exfoliant but a lot of patients and people in general are now overdoing it and really compromising their skin barrier so you want to go with something where less is more lactic acid is a very gentle chemical acid stones by sunday riley it is not going to be one of those massive powerhouses but it's very gentle and it's going to help you lightly buff your skin so this one's a nice one and then usually i would say be careful with salicylic acid as it can be drying but i found this one by first aid beauty which is two percent salicylic acid safe for sensitive skin which they claim on here i personally have not used it but it is something out there if you are acne prone to sensitive skin you might want to look into these um first aid beauty two percent salicylic acid um treatment pads they're just something to kind of think about all right and finally moisturizers you want to think of your skin as a broken baby's butt okay and you just want to cocoon your skin you want to cocoon it you want to restore your skin barrier you want to treat it like it is a sculpture on the verge of breaking and so moisturizers are going to be the best thing for you and so i have a bunch so starting with again dr jart has this ceramide cream this one is infused with ceramides it's great for super dry skin it's also great for sensitive skin like we talked about it comes in a nice um tube metallized tube and it is a good and really thick cream again not for somebody with super oily skin somebody with really dry slash sensitive skin this might just be enough for you again if you're super sensitive though i would be careful because it's not necessarily the quote unquote purest of products out there as it has other ingredients as well including a scent okay for example it has citrus in it so just beware but it is going to help if you're super dry and you need your barrier repaired if you're worried about any sort of scent your best bet is plain old vaseline this is probably the cheapest and the fastest way you're going to fix your face or your skin if you have super sensitive skin where your barrier is compromised it's literally just petroleum jelly in it and there's no lanolin whereas for example aquaphor contains lanolin so this is something i think you guys should look into and not be scared to test out on your face if your skin is extremely sensitive broken dry trapped irritated flaky stingy etc you might want to do this for a week see how your face responds to it and then decide if you hate it or if it actually saved your face just saying so number three is the sequel fat cream you guys can find this at your local drugstore it's by aven and then i've spoken about this i love the sycoplast balm b5 by la roche posay it's a very thick and chewy cream it is really really like it just cocoons everything it is not for somebody who you're gonna have to really get it in there it does have a little bit of zinc in it which causes that white cast but that can also be inflammatory reducing so just something to kind of think about if your skin is extremely sensitive and just not in a good spot and if you want to treat yourself a really nice one for winter coming up is skinceuticals triple lipid this one is loaded in ceramides and it's going to help to restore your skin's barrier and finally a sunscreen a very easy sunscreen that you guys can use a sensitive skin that's not going to kill your face in the process it's going to not only help protect and soothe it cetaphil they have this daily facial moisturizer with spf 20 which is honestly too light but it's something to start with if you are somebody who cannot approach any sort of sunscreen in the u.s at least without getting some sort of reaction it is with titanium dioxide and zinc dioxide so it is a um mineral based sunscreen it does come with a tint all right not necessarily the best of tints for everyone myself included but again if you're somebody who's super sensitive and you just want to try to get some sort of protection in and you don't walk a lot outside during the day or don't work by a window you can at least try to start incorporating this sort of sunscreen in your daily routine so those are some of my favorite products in a nutshell i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you sensitive souls out there can now sort of walk through a beauty aisle with a little bit more confidence and i hope this video was helpful i will catch you guys next week have a great weekend [Music] you",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video I'm going to share with you some products that I think will be really helpful for those of you out there suffering with a redness on the face whether it be due to rosacea or acne that heals with redness also those of you out there with darker skin types who are coping with hyperpigmentation listen up many of these products will help you as well because one of the challenges that people with darker skin may not appreciate is that redness can actually show up looking a little bit more like discoloration and if you've got some background hyperpigmentation going on it can actually be kind of challenging to distinguish redness from hyperpigmentation and you may actually have both things going on the first product that I'm going to recommend for you guys is a face wash at the end of the day is when I cleanse my skin and I only cleanse my skin once a day you can cleanse your skin twice a day but if you're dealing with redness try and keep it just to once a day the more times you put cleanser on your face and wash your face more likely it is to dry your skin and lead to worsening redness and I can really be a challenge to choose a cleanser if you cope with redness because all cleansers that are intended as it should be to remove dirt oil makeup all that goop off your skin they actually take some of your natural skin barrier with it and that makes you more predisposed to dryness and irritation a cleanser that is really good at minimizing this damage to the barrier but it does a good job taking off all the gunk is the sarony hydrating creamy cleanser this has Stara minds which are restoring for the skin barrier and it's free of added fragrance it's really a good choice so if you find that that one stings and burns a sagging cleanser that I would recommend for people with redness is the first aid beauty at face cleanser this product was sis with FA B antioxidant booster anyways this product has a licorice root extract as you many of the products I'm going to mention in today's video and licorice root is well known to be calming for redness and to inflammatory so you will see it in a lot of products marketed for people with redness so this has that in it and honestly I find that I don't know if it's all in my head with a licorice root but I do appreciate that this has kind of a calming soothing effect on the skin when I use it it also has fever if you extract in it as you many products aimed at people with redness feverfew has like a licorice root and shown to calm down redness and be anti-inflammatory however some people are easily irritated by that ingredient and were allergic to it the most allergenic part of feverfew is something called Perth dental line but in cosmetics that's actually been removed so it's pretty low risk but some people still are bothered by it if that's you then you might want to avoid this but otherwise it's really good and it's cruelty free it's pretty affordable so I love this one obviously it goes without saying I'm going to tell you you have to protect your skin from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun everyone has to do this but in the case of redness it's really important because ultraviolet radiation actually drives a lot of inflammation of the skin baser dilation and contributes to excess redness in the case of the melasma and these diseases of hyperpigmentation not only does the ultraviolet radiation Drive that inflammatory component that yields redness but it also pushes your skin towards making more pigment abnormally and creating hyperpigmentation so really important so I think a sunscreen that is tinted is a great option because the tent will help to camouflage some of the redness and in the case of hyperpigmentation the tent will also offer you some additional protection against pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light a sunscreen that's really great if you have fair skin and are looking for a tinted sunscreen is the exudes sheer daily protector this is a mineral sunscreen it only has as its active sunscreen ingredient zinc and titanium dioxide its mineral only and so for people with redness sunscreens that have chemical filters in them can cause more irritation and redness they don't get along well with them so I wanted to make sure I chose one that was mineral only this one is also great because it has green tea in it which is helpful for calming down redness it's anti-inflammatory gives a little bit of acne control and has been shown to diminish the appearance of pores it looks really good on the skin and it doesn't burn or sting around the eyes it doesn't ball or pull up or any of those nuisance e things but if you have a darker skin type you might find that the tint on this it's still pretty fair and kind of looks chalky Caste if you have a darker skin type a mineral only tinted sunscreen that works really well for darker skin types it's clear mineral tinted sunscreen or coats I will list suppose both of those down below for you all but if you have more of a medium skin tone the Sun fill redness relieving daily facial moisturizer SPF 20 is a good one to consider it has a licorice root in it which will help calm down that redness its mineral only so it's not gonna be irritating or staying the tint is more on the peachy kind of orange tan side so better for medium skin tones it's only SPF 20 so I recommend actually putting this on over a mineral only on tinted sunscreen that way you kind of camouflage you can use you need a higher SPF mineral sunscreen as your base layer and then kind of camouflage it with this so it helps mask that white cast and it also helps in providing some cosmetic camouflage against the redness and this looks really nice on the skin actually this I kind of considered this like a BB cream or a CC cream for those of you in the UK I did not forget about you I have sunscreen recommendations for both fair skin and darker skin type no these are chemical sunscreens so they might sting a little bit but the chemical filters in these are excellent for providing really really broad spectrum coverage of all wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation that can affect your skin and lead to redness and pigmentation I honestly don't have a lot of experience with mineral tinted sunscreens from the UK or anywhere in outside of the US I mostly I'm familiar with chemical one so that's why I picked these because I have the greatest familiarity with them altruist is a really sensitive skin friendly but the tint on the altruist is pretty dark so if you you know it's better for darker skin types in other words if you're fair with the rosacea for example you might not care for this in which case I definitely recommend the Bioderma a are SPF 50 plus tint on this is really nice the Alturas one goes on green and that helps in providing some camouflage against the redness and as you blend it onto the skin the other pigments kind of come out and take over and it turns to a darker brown now for people with redness especially related to rosacea it's best if you're gonna wear a makeup to choose makeup that is mineral tends to be very well tolerated for people with rosacea and a product that I enjoy and I think can be helpful is a mineral SPF powder now I reviewed several of these for you guys in the past and I have a few here that I'm gonna recommend but what you have to know about these mineral sunscreen powders is they really are like sprinkles on a cupcake it's a little bit of extra but it's not the whole frosting you need your base layer sunscreen when you put on a mineral powder it doesn't put on an even layer of SPF but it can be helpful for cosmetic camouflage of redness and also masking some of the shine of sunscreen and very well tolerated in people with sensitive skin the first one is the colorscience Unforgettable SPF 50 powder I've worked with this company numerous times but I love their products including this it is very expensive I will give it that but it's a very high SPF and it looks really nice on the skin just in terms of the pigment that they use it really looks nice and it stays on the skin very well it doesn't fall out a lot so I like this one personally but I know it's pretty expensive I know one that's pretty good is the supergroup invisible setting powder now this one doesn't have the spectrum of kind of tint range and depth of tint for cosmetic camouflage at the redness but it does do a really good job in reducing shine its SPF 45 so pretty comparable to the colorscience one a lot less expensive and then a cheapy one works pretty well is the derma derma e essential sun protection mineral powder SPF 30 a little bit lower but much less expensive zinc and titanium dioxide and it looks really good on the skin alright moving into the category of moisturizers moisturizing your face particularly namely a nighttime like after you cleanse the skin is really important for redness because when you cleanse the skin the skin barrier becomes impaired also just as part of redness a lot of that has to do with the dryness and irritation using a moisturizer can really address that barrier defect and help in rescuing your skin so to speak I adore the procurer rosa care product again with licorice root extract and this is a green tint so it will give you some cosmetic camouflage of the redness you may be wondering like why do I care about that at nighttime you actually can use this again in the morning if you wanted to underneath your sunscreen just make sure it dries fully before putting the sunscreen on it's very soothing in addition to the licorice root extract it also has niacinamide which will also help not only for calming down inflammation and irritation but can also have helped in issues related to hyperpigmentation this is really a good choice for those of you with a darker skin type that has a lot of hyperpigmentation plus redness that's a good choice mixture I love bioderma sensibio AR as well yeah the Bioderma moisturizers as liquorice we announced a soy extract I believe both of which can be anti-inflammatory and calm down redness but also helpful for hyperpigmentation Hannon has laminaria extract which is a marine extract and I've talked about those before they are competitive with hyaluronic acid for water binding capacity so this is a really a good one for our adding hydration into the skin as well as soothing redness alright and then indeed lasse has these color series of color correctors they have like one for yellow kind of sallow skin one for just hyperpigmentation but they've got a redness one this is the one I'm most familiar with nano blur and the color green it really helps as well I don't believe it has any active ingredients that address redness it's really more just that green tint that blends into the skin and camouflages out that redness this is really nice it kind of has like a blurring of back Domas as it alludes to in the title nano blur and this is a nice moisturiser for a night time or you could try using this under your sunscreen as well just again make sure it dries fully that way when you put the sunscreen on you kind of get take advantage of that green tint see if you use a product like this over your sunscreen it wipes the sunscreen off so the sunscreen has to be the last thing but if you put the sunscreen on moisturizer and while they're damp it can interfere with how the film is formed with a sunscreen so make sure it's fully dry that's what I'm getting at so key aspect of skin care keep it simple keep it minimal a few products is best especially when it comes to irritation redness discoloration more stuff you put on and more likely not it is to get worse any time people ask me in the comments how do i layer XYZ T&F together or product it's Z and Q can they be combined whatever you start wanting to combine all of these different products from multiple different manufacturers you're really going into an unknown there's no objective answer to a lot of these questions other than on you're probably just putting yourself at increased risk for irritation and potentially compromising the if efficacy of the actual active ingredients by keeping things really simple and just checking to the bare minimum you really maximize chances of good outcome from the actual active ingredient you're pursuing in the case of many of these products it might be licorice root and minimizing the risk of irritation and skin problems that would have been worse than your redness but yeah those are the products for redness that I can recommend you guys I know it's not fun to deal with redness people are not nice like people will ask why's your face rad it's like why are you so rude why are you a jerk I mean obviously you know your face is red so yeah I hope these products are helpful and this video is useful to you if you liked it give the thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

skin enlarged pores and acne after a lot of research trying to figure out the causing solution i have found these products to help calm my sensitive skin and have noticed a big difference after sticking to this routine over the past two years [Music] so first cleansing i used to use the bioderma sensitive face wash but i noticed my skin was a lot more hydrated after using this cerave cleanser plus it's more affordable i just use one pump [Music] i know the way i'm washing my face seems a bit rough but i'm actually gently washing for around 20 seconds before rinsing my skin feels extremely plump and moisturized after this wash and i highly recommend this cleanser to anyone with sensitive skin i pat my face dry with a face towel that i change every day [Music] next i use hyaluronic acid by the ordinary which is a humectant it helps the skin to hold onto water keeping your skin moisturized i spray my face with mineral water which i keep in a spray bottle before gently applying the serum just be careful with what products you use before and after this serum it works better when you don't mix products together before applying and i always make sure to gently tap the product in until my skin has fully absorbed it niacinamide and zinc this is another perfect serum for those with rosacea acne and enlarged pores i always notice my skin texture is a lot smoother after using this i did perch for around a month when first using this but the deep inflammatory redness i had disappeared and all the small bumps i got around my forehead and cheeks went away i just used one large drop to cover my entire face and neck it's always advised to use spf to protect your skin from aging and getting damaged by uv rays i used this tinted cream by bareminerals which gives a glowy radiant look and you can just spread it with your fingers [Music] as i tend to leave the house a lot and i don't want to be self-conscious of my rosacea but i also don't want to use heavy makeup because it clogs pores and it's too much effort i use this cream which is good for people with sensitive skin it's gluten fragrance paraben free and more [Music] i use the cerave moisturizer when my skin is feeling super dry or i treat it as a spot cream for sun cream i use this la roche posay invisible fluid i have tried other sun creams which either tingles my skin or is too white and oily or my skin becomes flaky when applying makeup so far this has been the only sun cream that hasn't given me any issues but i'm open to any other recommendations this organic rosehip oil is a perfect replacement for a moisturizer it doesn't clog pores or make your face oily it has a perfect balance and hydrates my skin when it's feeling dry sometimes after showering i'll use this instead of all the other products and then apply makeup i only perched for a week when first using this and it really helps to calm down my redness as you can see my face is glowing my cheeks are shiny and smooth this is my simple affordable am routine [Music] when removing my makeup i use the bioderma scentsy bird remover i used to use simple wipes after realizing wipes are too abrasive for my skin type and doesn't fully remove makeup [Music] when only applying spf i just use one cotton pad and gently wipe my face and neck i always see beauty salons and makeup artists use this to remove makeup and now i know why it's perfect for every skin type and you see results it also doesn't leave your skin feeling tight or dry [Music] i use the cerave face wash again and i don't use any type of physical exfoliator or brush as it's not good for rosacea skin types time is simple and again it depends on how my skin is behaving but tonight i'm just using niacinamide as a first step before going on to my next step [Music] it's important to keep using this serum if you have large pores i then use azelaic acid which is perfect for cleaning out pores and encourages cell turnover [Music] every time i get a large spot on my face i will apply this over it for two to three days before applying any type of spot sticker and it really helps diminish the spot without scarring i just apply a pea-sized amount to the areas where i break out the [Music] most there's a lot more that you should do for your skin in terms of what you eat what you drink and how fit you are it's important to be clean on the inside before you focus on the outside i drink honey tea every morning to regulate bowel movement and honey contains antibacterial properties so it's good for acne prone skin you already know that i eat super clean according to my intolerances and this really helped get rid of my redness and acne recently i have been supplementing as my body is deficient in nutrients i have been taking this calcium magnesium and zinc supplement magnesium can reduce stress and boost exercise performance zinc has wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties next i take probiotics i have been taking this prior to the chinese medicine that i'm currently doing and recently this really helps my gut and having a clean healthy gut means having healthier skin finally i've been taking this skin nails and hair supplement it's only been a few weeks and i have noticed improvements with my nails now i'm waiting to see if it does anything for my skin it does contain collagen which improves skin elasticity and increases blood flow to the skin [Music] [Music] you",

        "transcript": "[Music] hey welcome back to my channel i'm kayla and today i'm going to be talking to you guys about my skincare routine obviously my face is looking pretty rough today and that is for this specific reason and that's to show you guys the before and after of the products that i have been using for the past month and a half so to start off i have a red face i have rosacea on the majority of my face along with what i like to call reversed raccoon eyes my under eyes are pretty white and the rest of my face is red and i hate it so that's why i like to cover it up with makeup the product that i have been using is by epiones and i absolutely 100 percent recommend this brand to you guys their products smell absolutely amazing it's super light on your skin it's very moisturizing especially if you have you know dry skin dry to oily combinations they also do have products for oily skin if that is something that you need unfortunately that's not what i need um so you might have to do some research on that all right so let's go ahead and get into the three products that i use for my rosacea the first product and i need to remind you guys that uh for the rosacea you need to use these products in order for it to work that's what i was told so okay so the first product that you want to use for your rosacea is obviously your cleanser so this is the epionce gentle foaming cleanser and i'm also going to put up some photos right here for you guys so you can see it a little bit better this stuff is super light on your skin it smells absolutely amazing and i've had some i've had some cleansers that feel pretty heavy on my skin and they actually burn this however does not burn it also hydrates your skin and it takes off your makeup great the next product that i use is the light lytic tx comment below if i completely just butchered that name but i'm pretty sure that is how you pronounce it this also smells super super amazing this is a blemish correction so this is something that's going to help pull out the redness in your face or not pull out the redness but get rid of it um i mean i guess you could say the same thing but this also helps with your wrinkles it helps tighten your skin along with the facial cream which is next this is the epionce renewal facial cream this stuff is absolutely amazing super light as well if you do it the right way if you put way too much product on your face obviously it's going to feel heavy and you're going to look oily so you want to avoid that put the right amount on your face it also helps tighten your skin smooth out your texture and when you're also using the light lytic tx and the renewal facial cream together it is also a very very good anti-aging regimen alright so there you have it those are the three products that i use in my skincare routine the gentle foaming cleanser the light lytic tx and the renewal facial cream if you enjoyed this video go ahead and hit that like button and if you want to see some more content like this or really any other content that i produce go ahead and subscribe to my channel and i will see you on the next one oh by the way when you're using these products to start out you want to use them like two to three times a day and then you can work your way up to maybe once a day and i would suggest using them at night um that way you're not like sweating it off during the day because that would suck [Music]",
