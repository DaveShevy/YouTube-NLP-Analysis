        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "the three best products from the ordinary for rosacea prone skin if you do have rosacea it can be very difficult to find products that work well rosacea naturally is much more sensitive than even dry skin or sensitive skin and there's a lot of different things that can trigger rosacea such as eating spicy foods drinking alcohol or even going out into the Sun rosacea is primarily a vascular condition meaning the little blood capillaries that are naturally in your face are at the root cause for why this flares up for some people and although it's normally this redness in the cheeks rosacea can have pimples it's not the same thing as acne but they can look like acne and it is possible to have both rosacea and acne together these are the three best products from an ingredient perspective that should be okay for rosacea prone skin and that have the actives that have the potential to help and the first one actually mimics what dermatologists prescribe this is the salic acid ten percent in silicone and as a liqu acid is a really cool ingredient you may be familiar with other skincare acids however this one is much more gentle and for rosacea prone skin it can help dermatologists actually prescribe a 15-percent as they like acid solution for some patients with rosacea you can't get that over the counter it's too high of a percentage to get without prescription but this is at 10% and you can find other solutions that have 5% etc this helps with the redness of rosacea but it also helps if you do get those little white pustules those pimple like looking things and azalea kasih does also help with acne in case you have both as the oleic acid can burn a little bit when being put on the skin so do be aware of that but it is one of the ingredients that once the skin builds up tolerance to it can actually help to protect your skin a little bit more over the long run meaning that rosacea prone skin is less likely to flare up from other ingredients being used somewhere down the line because this is an a dimethicone base it's really nice and smooth onto the skin kind of like a primer the only things that it can ball up if you go at it too aggressively so I would recommend starting by patting it on the other thing is that as a liqu acid can be used day and night no problem dr. Sam is a dermatologist that I love and admire and she has used azalea Cassatt on pregnant and nursing patients for those who are pregnant earners it's hard to find skincare that is safe for both you and your baby so it's nice that this is an option and the other thing is that it's fairly unreactive so it's generally okay to use with most other things in a routine because of its silicone base it does work best after your serums either as a step before your moisturizers are kind of in place of your moisturizer or before your sunscreen since it has that silicone butt next you do have to consider sunscreen yes sunscreen can be used to help combat rosacea and the reason why is because the Sun is one of the major flares we see rosacea being vascular can be triggered by a lot of things but most people who suffer from it say that sun exposure is a big one sunscreen and the prevention of the UV rays from damaging those delicate little capillaries inside of the skin is really important not only to prevent it from flaring but to actually keep it under control and down regulate the steps that are already happening in your skin this is a mineral sunscreen from the ordinary I really love this one a lot of people have sensitivities to some of the chemical ingredients in sunscreen a lot of those are things like a boban zone oxybenzone octinoxate Homo say late those are not necessarily bad things however for people with sensitive skin they can be stinging they can be irritating and especially for people with rosacea prone skin the skin is already hypersensitive so you don't want to offend it more this sunscreen is an SPF 30 it's a great option that you could put on in the morning and the other thing is that it does have some other ingredients in here such as urea and such as Alan toen we've spoken about these ingredients before on this channel but as a little reminder these are both very soothing to the skin specifically urea can be helpful and Alan toen has been known to be anti-inflammatory which if you're having a rosacea flare-up would be very useful because we're talking about redness you know that this includes a recommendation for the niacinamide and zinc 10% this is really one of the best solutions that the ordinary has when it comes to large pores oiliness and redness and seeing as rosacea is this redness condition this vascular condition this is a really great place to start niacin amide otherwise known as b3 is a water-soluble vitamin and it really can do amazing things for the skin in combination with the zinc it helps to not only stabilize this but really target the areas of the skin that are experiencing that redness it take a little bit of time and some people have noticed that their skin kind of purges which means it gets a little bit worse before it gets better on initial application of this but especially for those who are struggling from rosacea that has the little white pustules or if you have rosacea and acne in combination this can help to down-regulate your skin's natural oil production so bye-bye grease that could be contributing to some of that and on top of that down regulate the redness that is normally associated with those flushes and those flares total transparency if your rosacea is really bad none of these products are gonna work once you get past kind of a critical point you really do have to go see a dermatologist and get a prescription or make sure it is rosacea and it's not acne in disguise there are also other types of redness in the skin such as erythema that are different than rosacea and need to be approached differently but lucky for you we have a whole bunch of guides on how to use the ordinary products as well as deep dives into basic ingredients and different skin conditions so that you can understand how to be a conscious consumer how to turn and learn your ingredient labels figure out what's in there and work with your healthcare team in order to treat and overall embrace and understand your skin if you learn something here make sure that you that like button and don't forget to brush that's subscribe button if you haven't already more videos can be found right here and I cannot wait to see you beautiful bunch of lies in the next video love you guys bye",

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as

        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "a non-prescription skincare routine to help\u00a0\nsupport rosacea-prone skin we totally filmed\u00a0\u00a0 and already posted that rosacea video talking\u00a0\nabout the different subtypes of rosacea and\u00a0\u00a0 the different stages of rosacea and some of the\u00a0\nthings that cause and trigger it but if you're\u00a0\u00a0 looking for a skincare routine that you can get\u00a0\nover the counter what products should you look\u00a0\u00a0 for what things should you avoid and what sort\u00a0\nof a skincare routine should you bring to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist so that you can work with that care\u00a0\nprovider to find prescriptions that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 going to help and clinically treat your rosacea\u00a0\nthat you can work into a daily routine it's\u00a0\u00a0 the acne big sis here to share with you a sample\u00a0\nroutine as well as do's and don'ts so as a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of a refresher rosacea is a chronic vascular\u00a0\ncondition it does normally happen to women between\u00a0\u00a0 the ages of 30 and 60 but it can't happen to\u00a0\nanyone at any time it's usually this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flushing of the skin but there are some types\u00a0\nsuch as ocular rosacea or papillopustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 or even thymus rosacea which is really intense and\u00a0\nyou need to see a derm for that one because things\u00a0\u00a0 like rhinophyma require plastic surgery i'm sorry\u00a0\nbut i'm not gonna sit here and bs you like one of\u00a0\u00a0 these beauty magazines saying that like turmeric\u00a0\nmilk and papaya face masks are gonna fix your\u00a0\u00a0 rhinophyma because i'm not going to give you the [\u00a0\n__ ] i am not going to sugarcoat it the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 i will do for you is slather it in spf which yes\u00a0\nis something that you should do for rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin remember that rosacea really goes alongside\u00a0\na lot of these triggers so even when you have a\u00a0\u00a0 really good skincare routine in place you want to\u00a0\nhave a rosacea diary know what those triggers are\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's the spicy food whether it's anxiety\u00a0\nand stress or if it is sun exposure and exercise\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle changes for rosacea are really important\u00a0\nso avoiding alcohol spicy foods or caffeine\u00a0\u00a0 can help but we're actually going to talk about\u00a0\ntopical caffeine in this video because that can\u00a0\u00a0 help let's first do a list of generalized do's\u00a0\nand don'ts now everything comes with nuance\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea is very individualized to each person\u00a0\nand someone might find that these can help while\u00a0\u00a0 others might find that some of these can hurt\u00a0\nbut these are kind of some general guidelines\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to things that people with rosacea\u00a0\nshouldn't use we want to avoid stuff that is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to irritate or aggravate the skin\u00a0\nwe don't want to use a bunch of fragrances and we\u00a0\u00a0 definitely don't want to use a bunch of essential\u00a0\noils rosacea prone skin can have a damaged barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and we don't want to exacerbate that we also don't\u00a0\nwant to use benzoyl peroxide this is normally used\u00a0\u00a0 in the treatment of acne but benzoyl peroxide is a\u00a0\nstrong oxidizer and we know that in rosacea prone\u00a0\u00a0 skin some of this ros damage can actually lead\u00a0\nto or exacerbate the rosacea condition so we\u00a0\u00a0 don't want oxidizers we actually want antioxidants\u00a0\nyou do want to avoid witch hazel you do want to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid camphor you do want to avoid eucalyptus\u00a0\nand menthol and things of that nature because\u00a0\u00a0 anything that is overly harsh can really irritate\u00a0\nthe skin and yes of course this includes walnut\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs and physical abrasive scrubs you just don't\u00a0\nwant to use them because we don't want to risk it\u00a0\u00a0 on the other hand we do want to use antioxidants\u00a0\nthese are great specifically something like green\u00a0\u00a0 tea is phenomenal and yes even caffeine can help\u00a0\ncaffeine is a topical vasoconstrictor and in\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea we know that this telangiectasia or these\u00a0\nbroken blood vessels are a huge part of rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 in this condition so using something that can act\u00a0\nas a vasoconstrictor can really help we also know\u00a0\u00a0 that vitamin c is a really great antioxidant but\u00a0\ni would actually avoid using irritating vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 c again we don't want anything that tingles so\u00a0\nirritating vitamin c goes over here but there\u00a0\u00a0 are forms of vitamin c that are either at lower\u00a0\nconcentrations or that are ester vitamin cs which\u00a0\u00a0 are better for sensitive skin they are oil soluble\u00a0\nand they seem to be tolerated better so using an\u00a0\u00a0 ester vitamin c or a low low low dose might be\u00a0\nokay but this is going to depend on the person\u00a0\u00a0 we also love our b vitamins we're talking\u00a0\nniacinamide and panthenol again these aren't\u00a0\u00a0 going to cure rosacea but niacinamide can help\u00a0\nthe skin create more ceramides which the skin\u00a0\u00a0 naturally needs and rosacea prone skin normally\u00a0\nhas a damaged skin barrier so we love that and\u00a0\u00a0 speaking of ceramides yes ceramides moisturizers\u00a0\nhydrators look for shea butter look for caprylic\u00a0\u00a0 triglyceride you could even look for really\u00a0\nocclusive barriers such as dimethicone or\u00a0\u00a0 petrolatum jelly which we find in vaseline i know\u00a0\nit's greasy and it's kind of gross and it's sticky\u00a0\u00a0 but as an overnight mask for rosacea prone skin\u00a0\nthat can really help moisturizers and hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 are super great especially because rosacea is\u00a0\nusually paired with a little bit of dryness\u00a0\u00a0 and irritation except for rhinophyma which is\u00a0\nnormally large pores and oiliness but again see\u00a0\u00a0 a derm and a plastic surgeon for that but when\u00a0\nit comes to hydrators we also have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid now a lot of people with rosacea\u00a0\nlike hyaluronic acid but there are some people\u00a0\u00a0 who have rosacea and sensitive skin and they\u00a0\nfind that hyaluronic acid is horrible for them\u00a0\u00a0 this is anecdotal i've asked a few dermatologists\u00a0\nabout this some say yes some say no but i think it\u00a0\u00a0 really depends on the person hyaluronic acid comes\u00a0\nin different molecular weights it is something\u00a0\u00a0 that is made naturally by ourselves it's in our\u00a0\nskin it's in our tissues but for some people\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronic acid can be irritating and if that's\u00a0\nyou cut it out of your skincare routine and try to\u00a0\u00a0 avoid it it's in plenty of products and that might\u00a0\nbe a culprit but for others hyaluronic acid is\u00a0\u00a0 a really good humectant it can help so you might\u00a0\nwant to include it glycerin as well is a wonderful\u00a0\u00a0 humectant that you might want to look for and\u00a0\nagain we mentioned shea butter these hydrators\u00a0\u00a0 really good for rosacea prone skin amino acids\u00a0\nand peptides are also fantastic there are\u00a0\u00a0 many different peptides out there are there any\u00a0\nspecifically that have been proven to help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 not to my current knowledge and understanding but\u00a0\na lot of them don't hurt and i would say they are\u00a0\u00a0 okay to use and do you know that we had to save\u00a0\nthe best for last we're talking about azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid and spf which is your bff now the best spf\u00a0\nis the one that you're going to use but i do have\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of actual recommendations and why for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i prefer recommending a mineral\u00a0\u00a0 over organic slash chemical spfs we're going\u00a0\nto talk about that in a second though because\u00a0\u00a0 we can't forget our favorite topical dicarboxylic\u00a0\nacid which is azoleic acid this is phenomenal for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea especially if you are someone who has\u00a0\npapulo pustular rosacea if you are pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0 breastfeeding this is safe to use and azelaic acid\u00a0\nis actually sold in a prescription form at above\u00a0\u00a0 15 here in america and it comes in different\u00a0\ngel and foam creams but you can also get it\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter this is amazing it is often what\u00a0\ndermatologists use and prescribe and what you get\u00a0\u00a0 over the counter is just a lower amount of that\u00a0\nsame active ingredient now something else that is\u00a0\u00a0 used commonly in the treatment for acne but has\u00a0\nshown some promise in papulo pustular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is a dappling gel i do want to make it clear that\u00a0\nthis is an off-label use and this isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0 help with erythema a dappling gel was compared to\u00a0\nmetronidazole in a study and they did find that\u00a0\u00a0 there was a decrease in papillopustular lesions\u00a0\nhowever there was not a difference in erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 redness so for people with that form of rosacea\u00a0\na dappling gel might help but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0 be an end-all be-all and again if you're not\u00a0\nusing the sunscreen or if you're not using the\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid reach for those two things first so\u00a0\na skincare routine for rosacea-prone skin starts\u00a0\u00a0 with a good cleanser you want to use something\u00a0\nthat's non-stripping that's not irritating\u00a0\u00a0 something that isn't going to aggravate the skin\u00a0\nagain avoiding fragrances and really high plant\u00a0\u00a0 actives this is one that i personally love this is\u00a0\nthe hydrating gel to cream cleanser from paula's\u00a0\u00a0 choice this is a nice milky emulsion so it's\u00a0\nhydrating to the skin it's non-stripping but it's\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing without being irritating this also has\u00a0\nsome antioxidants like green tea it also has some\u00a0\u00a0 phospholipids as well as a whole bunch of amino\u00a0\nacids we are talking glycine alanine isoleucine\u00a0\u00a0 prolene basically you name it they put them all\u00a0\nin here this is a really fantastic face wash\u00a0\u00a0 especially for rosacea prone skin because there's\u00a0\nnothing in here that will irritate and if anything\u00a0\u00a0 these things can slightly help you also know that\u00a0\nthere are many cleansers that i just love they\u00a0\u00a0 are some of my go-to's the inky list oat cleansing\u00a0\nbalm is a really great one that is non-irritating\u00a0\u00a0 and non-stripping there are a lot of cleansers\u00a0\nfrom k-beauty that do rosacea prone skin very\u00a0\u00a0 well and generally a cleanser without fragrance\u00a0\nthat is not overly stripping with very few actives\u00a0\u00a0 but lots of antioxidants is going to be a great\u00a0\nway to go then let's talk about toners toners\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea prone skin i don't always recommend\u00a0\nand the reason why is because toners generally\u00a0\u00a0 are meant to balance the ph of the skin but a lot\u00a0\nof them have things like bhas or exfoliating acids\u00a0\u00a0 or treatments and as mentioned with rosacea\u00a0\nprone skin we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\u00a0 harsh exfoliators we want to avoid a lot of those\u00a0\nactives we really want to soothe the skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 why i do like things that are a bit more essences\u00a0\nnow make sure the essence doesn't have fragrance\u00a0\u00a0 in it one of my absolute favorites is this one\u00a0\nfrom pyeongchang yule this is probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 gentle liquid grape jelly masterpiece that\u00a0\ni could ever recommend i love this for the\u00a0\u00a0 face and if you are looking for a really really\u00a0\nnice essence that just helps to soothe the skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is it the main ingredient in here is\u00a0\nastragalus membranaceous root extract this has\u00a0\u00a0 arginine and this also has hydroxyethyl cellulose\u00a0\nit's just a really nice gentle fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 formula and again for rosacea prone skin it's\u00a0\nnormally coupled with this dryness we want to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrate the rosacea-prone skin and using this as a\u00a0\nboost of moisture especially after a cleanser you\u00a0\u00a0 can lock this in with a moisturizer can be super\u00a0\nsuper helpful and a lot of people just anecdotally\u00a0\u00a0 say that applying products to moist skin kind of\u00a0\nhelps their rosacea obviously when you're taking\u00a0\u00a0 a shower washing your face don't use overly hot or\u00a0\noverly cold water make sure that it is temperate\u00a0\u00a0 because temperature changes can be a trigger for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin but using something like this\u00a0\u00a0 just helps other products penetrate deeper and\u00a0\nthis really helps to lock moisture in so that\u00a0\u00a0 your skin isn't overly dehydrated another good\u00a0\noption is this superoxide dismutase from niod\u00a0\u00a0 this is a very fancy mist but i absolutely love\u00a0\nthis and there is not something in here that has\u00a0\u00a0 been directly related to curing or solving rosacea\u00a0\nthere is no cure for rosacea we can just try to\u00a0\u00a0 support the skin and use prescriptions that can\u00a0\nhelp treat things right and anything over the\u00a0\u00a0 counter is really going to be supplementary to\u00a0\nwhat a dermatologist prescribes but i have found\u00a0\u00a0 that anecdotally superoxide dismutase does look\u00a0\npromising and again anecdotally with patients and\u00a0\u00a0 clients it does help their skin now there was one\u00a0\nstudy that actually looked at how rosacea prone's\u00a0\u00a0 skin reacts to ros these reactive oxygen species\u00a0\nand this free radical damage and this study found\u00a0\u00a0 that the release of superoxide dismutase which\u00a0\nis an enzyme with antioxidant activity is another\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism providing defense against oxidative\u00a0\ndamage in rosacea prone skin so theoretically\u00a0\u00a0 if we apply superoxide dismutase topically to the\u00a0\nskin that might help again is it going to cure it\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely not but can it hurt probably not\u00a0\nand if you really like the spray form of this\u00a0\u00a0 or if you have rosacea and this is something\u00a0\nthat you're willing to give a try i've heard\u00a0\u00a0 and seen anecdotally this antioxidant does great\u00a0\nthings and i personally love it and i do recommend\u00a0\u00a0 haruharu wonder also has their black rice toner\u00a0\nit is like kombucha in a bottle i love it so much\u00a0\u00a0 just keep in mind that although this doesn't have\u00a0\nfragrance it does have lavender oil and it does\u00a0\u00a0 have limonene etc and so this might not be the\u00a0\nbest for the most sensitive prone skin another\u00a0\u00a0 k-beauty favorite is from purito they have a toner\u00a0\nthat they actually took all of the fragrance out\u00a0\u00a0 of it is the purito cintella unscented toner\u00a0\nthis one is fantastic again no fragrance very\u00a0\u00a0 nice hydrating and soothing to the skin and if\u00a0\nyou're sensitive or if you have irritation or if\u00a0\u00a0 you're just looking for a rosacea buffer with\u00a0\nmore moisturization this one can really help\u00a0\u00a0 do keep in mind that the haruhabu black rice toner\u00a0\nand the purito unscented suntella one do have\u00a0\u00a0 sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid in them so\u00a0\nif you're sensitive avoid that and that these two\u00a0\u00a0 the superoxide dismutase and the pyongkang yule\u00a0\nones do not so keep that in mind and after toners\u00a0\u00a0 we love serums and treatments some of my favorite\u00a0\nserums contain of course azelaic acid that\u00a0\u00a0 dicarboxylic acid this is phenomenal and there\u00a0\nare a couple different products that i recommend i\u00a0\u00a0 love the ordinaries i feel like it is inexpensive\u00a0\nit is affordable it works really well and people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have said that they've had great luck\u00a0\nwith this again if you get a prescription cream\u00a0\u00a0 such as phoenicia gel or the foam that is a higher\u00a0\npercentage of azelaic acid but topically this one\u00a0\u00a0 from the ordinary is great i've heard a couple\u00a0\npeople complain about graininess with the ordinary\u00a0\u00a0 one if that bothers you then of course avoid it\u00a0\nbut i personally don't see it to be a deal breaker\u00a0\u00a0 for me now if you don't like that graininess there\u00a0\nis also the paulus choice azolic acid booster this\u00a0\u00a0 one is great you could mix it in with moisturizers\u00a0\nyou could use it on its own again this azelaic\u00a0\u00a0 acid phenomenal and then if you want something\u00a0\nthat really is a more serum texture there's the\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog one holy frog hollow frog hollow frog\u00a0\nis it like a holographic frog or is it like a\u00a0\u00a0 holy frog like with like an angel halo but this\u00a0\nholy frog antioxidant dewdrop is an amazing serum\u00a0\u00a0 and yes it contains azoleic acid as well as other\u00a0\ningredients like coq10 coq10 coenzyme 10 otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 known as eubecquinone is really great it's an\u00a0\nantioxidant and support system for the skin this\u00a0\u00a0 product also has squalene aloe as well as sodium\u00a0\nhyaluronate so again hyaluronic acid type stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that really helps with moisture of the skin this\u00a0\nis a great one and it is fragrance free it does\u00a0\u00a0 have some orange extract so keep that in mind\u00a0\nif you're sensitive but overall it is a really\u00a0\u00a0 good one and i mean look at this i don't know if\u00a0\nit's an angel frog or if it's a holographic frog\u00a0\u00a0 or if it's like holy like holy the holiday\u00a0\ni mean i am so down for a holographic holy\u00a0\u00a0 angel frog like yes i i love it take my money just\u00a0\ntake it other serums that you can look for have\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants or vasoconstrictors in them again a\u00a0\ngreen tea is a really good one there is the benton\u00a0\u00a0 line they actually have a green tea serum that is\u00a0\nreally good again fragrance free this has green\u00a0\u00a0 tea it has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid this is\u00a0\na really good one and then shocker the ordinary's\u00a0\u00a0 caffeine eye serum this is the caffeine solution\u00a0\nfive percent plus epigala catagen three gallate\u00a0\u00a0 egcg this is actually amazing i don't recommend\u00a0\nthis under the eyes i recommend this all over\u00a0\u00a0 the face this is a caffeine serum and from the\u00a0\nordinary it's inexpensive it's a vasoconstrictor\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually feel that this is really helpful\u00a0\nfor rosacea prone skin we also spoke about\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide i wouldn't recommend niacinamide and\u00a0\nzinc i wouldn't recommend anything that dries out\u00a0\u00a0 the skin i would want like a hydrating niacinamide\u00a0\ncream or serum we've actually done videos on the\u00a0\u00a0 best and worst niacinamide ones and the purito\u00a0\ndeep sea water cream they have some fragrance free\u00a0\u00a0 niacinamide ones that are really really good and\u00a0\nas mentioned before adapylene is used off-label\u00a0\u00a0 for populopustular rosacea if you do have the\u00a0\npapules and the pustules as well as rosacea plus\u00a0\u00a0 acne this could be really helpful just remember\u00a0\nthat this is not going to treat the erythema or\u00a0\u00a0 the redness that is associated with rosacea\u00a0\nbut if you've tried everything talk to your\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist about adding a retinoid that could\u00a0\npotentially be helpful just make sure that you're\u00a0\u00a0 not adding a retinoid that could be irritating or\u00a0\ndrying to the skin and normally if a dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 is prescribing a retinoid for rosacea it's\u00a0\nbecause they've already taken you through the\u00a0\u00a0 topical antibiotics such as the doxycycline the\u00a0\ntetracycline the metronidazole the erythromycin\u00a0\u00a0 etc those are really going to come first before\u00a0\nprescription retinoids but it's good to keep in\u00a0\u00a0 mind and then of course moisturizers you can use\u00a0\ngel like moisturizers under your sunscreen during\u00a0\u00a0 the day and then we're going to talk about some\u00a0\nthick ones at night but look for moisturizers\u00a0\u00a0 that are supportive of the skin again niacinamide\u00a0\nmoisturizers are a really great option there is\u00a0\u00a0 one from saturday's skin that is phenomenal it has\u00a0\nniacinamide it has carrot it has adenosine it has\u00a0\u00a0 ceramide np it does have cholesterol and i'm\u00a0\npretty sure it's from a vegan source but i would\u00a0\u00a0 want to double check but it is also fragrance\u00a0\nfree so i would really recommend the saturday\u00a0\u00a0 skin one that one is great this one from the inky\u00a0\nlist is also good this is the peptide moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 peptides are fine for rosacea again i don't know\u00a0\nof any peptides that will directly help rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 but they don't really hurt egf or epidermal growth\u00a0\nfactor is a good one this is more of a gel formula\u00a0\u00a0 so i would recommend this as something lighter for\u00a0\ndaytime use any of the gel formulas i feel like\u00a0\u00a0 are better for day and as you know rosacea prone\u00a0\nskin can be coupled with this dryness especially\u00a0\u00a0 if it's not rhinophyma or the sphymatis rosacea\u00a0\nwhich is associated with oiliness but slathering\u00a0\u00a0 on those moisturizers is going to be so helpful\u00a0\nand in my personal opinion some of the greatest\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizers for rosacea prone skin are going to\u00a0\nbe the ones that do have ceramides in them and\u00a0\u00a0 really good barrier and skin support ceramidics\u00a0\nis absolutely one of my favorites i consider this\u00a0\u00a0 a leveled up version of cerave this has a bunch\u00a0\nof plant ceramides in it and she is thick this\u00a0\u00a0 goes on really well at night locks everything in\u00a0\nand even for my oily acne prone skin i love the\u00a0\u00a0 way this makes my face feel when i do wake up but\u00a0\nfor rosacea this is a really wonderful moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this one from dear claire's this\u00a0\none does have sodium hyaluronate as well as\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of fragrancing kind of plant ingredients\u00a0\nit doesn't have direct fragrance but it does have\u00a0\u00a0 plant ingredients but this one is really soothing\u00a0\nand great for the skin pacifica also has the wake\u00a0\u00a0 up beautiful with some quinoa and flour extracts\u00a0\nyou have to be okay i wouldn't recommend it\u00a0\u00a0 for super sensitive skin because of those flour\u00a0\ningredients it's technically a sleeping mask but\u00a0\u00a0 a sleeping mask is you know just an overnight\u00a0\nmoisturizer so i love that one and pacifica\u00a0\u00a0 actually came out with their vegan ceramide cream\u00a0\nit is one of my favorites it is so good it is\u00a0\u00a0 purple it has ceramides it is fragrance free and\u00a0\nit comes with little butterflies on it like hello\u00a0\u00a0 it is inexpensive it is affordable it is\u00a0\nabsolutely one of my favorites bubble as\u00a0\u00a0 well the bubble moisturizer if you want during the\u00a0\nday you can use the gel one and you can use the\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizing one at night that's another great\u00a0\noption but it's technically fragrance free now\u00a0\u00a0 i do believe it has geranial or limonene in it so\u00a0\njust be aware of that but that's another good one\u00a0\u00a0 and then the skin fix triple lipid moisturizer\u00a0\nis again really great i think that has sodium\u00a0\u00a0 hyaluronate but really good for helping with a\u00a0\ndamaged skin barrier and then as we mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 literally petrolatum jelly get some greasy nasty\u00a0\nvegan vaseline get yourself some solemo jelly\u00a0\u00a0 i don't recommend this during the day i would\u00a0\nonly do this at night but you could basically\u00a0\u00a0 you know use one of these hydrators and just\u00a0\nlock that [ __ ] in with some petrolatum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 vaseline type and that can definitely help to\u00a0\npush and penetrate that hydration deep into your\u00a0\u00a0 pores of course we're going to discuss sunscreen\u00a0\nbut what about mask treatments you know we did\u00a0\u00a0 mention sulfur sulfur is actually really good\u00a0\nand especially if your rosacea is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of these demodex mites you have to get that\u00a0\ndiagnosed by a derm but there are these arachnids\u00a0\u00a0 these eight-legged demodex mites that live inside\u00a0\nof your pores yes they do and they [ __ ] on your\u00a0\u00a0 face and they come out at night when you sleep\u00a0\nsorry to scare you and if you want a full video\u00a0\u00a0 on it let me know because it's very very fun to\u00a0\ntalk about but i digress demodex mites have been\u00a0\u00a0 related to rosacea and people who have a ton of\u00a0\ndemodex mites might have more triggers or flares\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea but again right now we don't have\u00a0\nenough evidence to say that one causes the other\u00a0\u00a0 or that there is a super strong direct correlation\u00a0\nin every single person but demodex mites do not\u00a0\u00a0 like sulfur masks and there is an acne-free sulfur\u00a0\nmask that i feel is really good if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0 a sulfur face mask in rosacea prone skin these\u00a0\nthings have been proven to help as well another\u00a0\u00a0 type of mask that you might want to consider is\u00a0\nred light therapy we know that led therapy has\u00a0\u00a0 been medically proven to work specifically red led\u00a0\nlights at a specific wavelength can penetrate the\u00a0\u00a0 skin they can help rebuild collagen and they can\u00a0\ndecrease inflammation there are different pathways\u00a0\u00a0 that are mediated by cellular signaling and red\u00a0\nlight from led can help which led is best i've\u00a0\u00a0 always really avoided the ones that if you don't\u00a0\nuse goggles i'm like are they actually going to\u00a0\u00a0 work are you actually protecting your eyes so\u00a0\ni really love the light stim it's amazing for\u00a0\u00a0 acne it's amazing for collagen stimulation i think\u00a0\nit's good for wrinkles it's good for rosacea again\u00a0\u00a0 red led and blue led have been medically proven\u00a0\ni love the light stem i am currently looking at\u00a0\u00a0 and reconsidering some of the face masks so the\u00a0\ndr dennis gross one is really expensive but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 looking at that one and then the current body\u00a0\none i'm looking at but i'm like you guys if it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't have the little eye things are we actually\u00a0\nprotected and is it actually strong enough to do\u00a0\u00a0 anything i'ma figure it out and i'm gonna find out\u00a0\nfor you okay and again i'm not gonna sugarcoat it\u00a0\u00a0 but i am gonna slather it and let's talk about\u00a0\nsunscreen because as we know sun is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 trigger for rosacea we want to make sure that we\u00a0\nare avoiding the sun we're talking hats avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 those really strong uv rays uh during the middle\u00a0\nof the day but we want to make sure that we are\u00a0\u00a0 protecting our face now there are many different\u00a0\nsunscreens out there but what should we look for\u00a0\u00a0 we want to use something that is fragrance free\u00a0\nbecause again fragrance can irritate the skin\u00a0\u00a0 now the best sunscreen is the one that you are\u00a0\ngoing to use so if that is a organic sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 that is a chemical sunscreen use it but for some\u00a0\npeople again clients and patients anecdotally have\u00a0\u00a0 had some issues with irritation especially\u00a0\nif their rosacea prone skin is coupled with\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive skin and for that reason a lot of\u00a0\nmy sunscreen recommendations are physical\u00a0\u00a0 mineral also considering that rosacea can happen\u00a0\nto anyone but it usually happens in fitzpatrick\u00a0\u00a0 types one through three so lighter skin tones\u00a0\nwith this celtic irish english background\u00a0\u00a0 usually a white cast isn't as big of an issue for\u00a0\nthese individuals that it is for someone who has\u00a0\u00a0 a black skin ebony skin or is a 4 5 or 6 on the\u00a0\nfitzpatrick scale so a lot of these are physical\u00a0\u00a0 but we do have some that have tints a really good\u00a0\none that i've been loving is this one from kinship\u00a0\u00a0 this is the self reflect probiotic moisturizing\u00a0\nsunscreen with an spf 32 this one is great one\u00a0\u00a0 of my tried and true this one is nearly invisible\u00a0\nfrom dermalogica it's expensive but boy is it good\u00a0\u00a0 this is the spf 30 invisible physical defense this\u00a0\none does have lavender in it so be aware of that\u00a0\u00a0 but i absolutely love this and this is great\u00a0\nfor rosacea there's also this one if you want\u00a0\u00a0 something with a little bit of a tint this one\u00a0\nis from bliss it is the block star invisible\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen spf 30. again completely mineral this\u00a0\none is tinted it does have blueberry extract in\u00a0\u00a0 it which we love for antioxidants but this also\u00a0\nhas lavender so just be aware of that cocoa\u00a0\u00a0 kind also has their daily spf 32 and then paula's\u00a0\nchoice has this one which our beautiful butterfly\u00a0\u00a0 paula actually loves this one is again fragrance\u00a0\nfree and this one is hyaluronic acid free as well\u00a0\u00a0 this is the super light daily wrinkle defense\u00a0\nbroad spectrum spf 30 and it also has antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and resveratrol so really really good for\u00a0\nrosacea prone skin i would say this is phenomenal\u00a0\u00a0 if you want a regular sunscreen this is\u00a0\nexcellent if you want a tint and you're okay\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavender and again a lot of these are\u00a0\nbroad spectrum meaning they prevent against uva\u00a0\u00a0 and uvb rays and even blue light protective\u00a0\nagain blue light i don't think it matters as\u00a0\u00a0 much unless you have a fitzpatrick type four\u00a0\nfive or six and you don't have to worry about\u00a0\u00a0 blue light from your screens your screens are not\u00a0\nproducing as much blue light as the sun and the\u00a0\u00a0 environment does but if you're worried about blue\u00a0\nlight specifically the blue light that comes from\u00a0\u00a0 the sun the high energy visible blue light then\u00a0\nyou know a really good broad spectrum sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0 can help because spf is what your mother no your\u00a0\nprofessor absolutely not your wife you would think\u00a0\u00a0 so but no it is your bff which is why you put\u00a0\nit on every single day and you reapply it and\u00a0\u00a0 you have a good relationship and you love to keep\u00a0\nit at arm's length for easy reapplication all of\u00a0\u00a0 these are listed below in the bottom tab if you\u00a0\nare interested those are affiliate links that are\u00a0\u00a0 there for you and i've actually made an entire\u00a0\nrosacea and sensitive skin category so if you\u00a0\u00a0 click on some of those there are actually shelves\u00a0\nthat correlate to different skin conditions and\u00a0\u00a0 concerns to make it easier to find products\u00a0\nthat are actually suited to different skin\u00a0\u00a0 conditions for instance rosacea versus acne it's\u00a0\nall there for you i did the work so you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to do remember to stay hydrated both orally and\u00a0\ntopically reapply your bff and always remember\u00a0\u00a0 to be beautiful both inside and out i cannot\u00a0\nwait to see you in the rosacea video where we\u00a0\u00a0 talk about the different types of rosacea what it\u00a0\nlooks like what the different subcategories are\u00a0\u00a0 because if you haven't seen that it is a boatload\u00a0\nof fun i love you and i'll see you right there bye my back hurts my crack hurts",

        "transcript": "probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea the first one is actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big

hit the subscribe button and the little notification bell so that you get notified when my new videos are up okay so finding skin care products actually will work when you have rosacea is a really tough go especially when you're talking about face washes and sunscreens anything that has chemical components because and I know you know this or you wouldn't have clicked on this video rosacea gives you a very sensitive skin most people think it's just redness but it's very very sensitive skin so it's my goal that by the end of this video you have some products that you can choose from and trust that will help you calm and reduce and soothe rosacea outbreaks or episodes all of the products I'm going to talk about today are in the video description box below and they are dermatologist approved and they can really really help now just like acne which I talked about on this channel incessantly I know since I have such a personal history with that rosacea is along with eczema and flama Torrey disease of the skin a lot of the same things that can trigger acne actually trigger rosacea and eczema so things like food things like skin care ingredients things like stress all can make these episodes and flare-ups happen so having the right skin care products and routine in place can really go a long way to keep flare-ups at bay and the really good news is that the products I'm going to talk about today they are so inexpensive okay first up at any routine of course is cleanser it's very very important that you use a cleanser that is not over drying and irritating Aveeno has an ultra calming face wash that's very good for rosacea it's a very mild formulation it's water based and it's infused with a botanical feverfew which has been shown to reduce redness and inflammation so it's a very calming face wash the other great thing is that it's fragrance free which is really really important when you have any kind of skin condition because fragrance can read really irritate your skin so this one is water-based fragrance free and will not strip your skin of the natural oil that it needs to be healthy it's also great at removing makeup for those of you who wear it so this makes an excellent choice for a cleanser for rosacea next up is moisturizer of course and moisturizer can really be a troublesome thing when you have rosacea because a lot of the common ingredients in skincare products are very irritating to this condition la roche-posay has a really wonderful moisturizers are called tolerate double repair face moisturizer it is also water and glycerin based it also has niacinamide which is really good for reducing inflammation and redness it also has ceramides which help your skin rebuild its actual structure and help it hold in moisture now if you're someone who has a lot of redness with your rosacea you really going to love this next product a Veen brand has an anti bred day soothing cream this is a really great light product formulation that also has a tint of green to it so that it automatically erases the red tones that rosacea produces now one of the best times to treat rosacea is at night when your skin is in its natural repair cycle and for a night moisturizer different brand which you've probably heard of before because they are the ones that have the different gel for acne which is a deplane well they have a night restorative cream that you can use or a night moisturizer it has hyaluronic acid ceramides in a lantern to help improve your skin's texture overnight so again while your skin is in that sleep repair cycle this particular product is going to deeply moisturize and heal your skin and just so we know how this all works ceramides are really important ingredient in that they are lipids that attach themselves to the skin help repair the skin structure retain moisture without irritation hyaluronic acid is a really important ingredient because it's part of your skin's natural structure abduct your skin already produces it it's super super hydrating and it really does help with cellular turnover and a lanten sounds like I'm saying Aladdin but it is kind of a magical ingredient it's made from the root of comfrey you've probably heard of comfrey tea as an herb it is able to soothe irritated skin and it actually helps the skin produce new tissue so again this Euler formulation for a night cream is a really superb choice now a lot of folks with rosacea have a very difficult time tolerating any kind of a serum because of the concentrated nature of the ingredients now la roche-posay has a very light anti redness reducing serum which is a very very well formulated product in fact it is so light it's really more like an essence spray but it too has red tone reducing ingredients that will take the redness out of rosacea without irritating your skin now another product that is super hard for people with rosacea to find that will work for them is sunscreen Cetaphil has a specially formulated moisturizer with an SPF of 30 and the great thing about this moisturizer is that it's mineral based and not chemical because it's the chemicals in sunscreen that can really trigger rosacea flare-ups them you guys who have it know what I'm talking about so this particular moisturizer and it's very inexpensive can be used as a sunscreen so you're gonna be totally protected without irritating your skin and it has caffeine and a lanten in it as well that will help reduce redness while it protects your skin from the ultraviolet and UVB UVA rays all of that now all of these products together can

        "published_at": "2023-04-22T14:00:35Z",
        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "foreign board certified dermatologist welcome to my channel thank you so much for your support thank you for your support on Tick Tock as well we're nearing 1 million friends there thank you for the top doctor Awards Seattle met magazine and Castle Connolly it's been a great year and so I'm really excited to see what 2023 has for all of us and cheers to more fun thank you guys and today is going to be a video I might say rosacea on the title or on the thumbnail but really this is for all of those people out there with sensitive skin including myself during the winter my skin tend to be more sensitive I wouldn't say in general I have sensitive skin but skin types do flip around with the weather you know there's normal oily dry combination sensitive skin types sensitive skin though I definitely do find is something they can flip around based on the weather and definitely in the winter time where we have cold weather you have the heaters on overnight you can wake up with really dry chapped lips and I get irritation around my cheekbones where it gets pretty red and noticeable during the day and how do we hide redness what products do we reach for when we have irritated skin so it's not just for rosacea today it's for those with sensitive skin and when we have irritation a lot of times we panic and we reach for whatever's on our bathroom counter we kind of overdo it and we get into this whole vicious cycle of the redness worsening and so we're gonna go over some gentle products today that you can consider now rosacea let's talk about rosacea if you have rosacea I see this on a daily basis in clinic and it's a chronic inflammatory skin condition where you get redness on your face flushing and you can also get acne rosacea where you get these acneoform red papules or bumps on your face usually around the nose inner cheeks the chin and it flares with stress alcohol sunlight for sure heat so a hot shower taking something hot out of the oven getting that blast of hot air in your face can really trigger whether it's redness and flushing or red bumps and there are different types of rosacea like postula rosacea rhinophymodus rosacea where you get the red nose with bulbous like changes where you have really enlarged oil glands that can be tough to treat and also deep rosacea called granulomatous rosacea so they're different types of rosacea but in general when you have rosacea you're already put into the ultra sensitive bucket in 2020 I saw a lot of people with rosacea having flares of the rosacea because they were on Tick Tock and they saw a popular Korean sheet mask and so people were using it and they got really bad irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from using a sheet mask so be very careful with your new products always start one product at a time about two weeks apart and if you want to spot test on your neck or a small area of your face first I'm all for that if you have rosacea and a lot of people with rosacea can't do those anti-aging skin care ingredients we talk about including vitamin C or ascorbic acid so I always say 10 is kind of like what you're looking for for ascorbic acid going to 15 or more will really increase your risk of irritation La Roche Posay has a lower than 10 percent ascorbic acid they're C cream this is the one that has five percent ascorbic acid metal Castle side and also neurosensing which is soothing as well well especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin and the other ingredient that's notorious for causing acne rosacea flares or rosacea flares would be retinol or retinoids things I prescribed especially the stronger stuff tretino and tazeratine can irritate rosacea and a lot of my patients or rosacea we can't do chemical peels on them because their skin is so sensitive chemical peel what the acids could bring on a flare if you want to use a retinoid I would recommend an over-the-counter retinol that is less potent than the stuff I would prescribe and what can we use for that one good product I like to talk about a lot on this channel is Olay retinol retinol 24 is a nice formulation because it has glycerin it has niacinamide and I like niacinamide combined with my sunscreens cleansers moisturizers and retinol that is anti-inflammatory great for those with acne or rosacea prone skin because it also regulates sebum production and helps with inflammation so it won't clog you up and cause a flare this is a very gentle retinol I would recommend either the max or the retinol 24 plus peptide OG one without the max the max is 20 percent more of their High hydration complex which means maybe more glycerin more niacinamide I don't think it has more retinol I can't tell by the labeling on the website and they don't disclose their retinol percentage either other one that's a little bit more pricey than this because Costco has the OG in a two pack for a great price go for something more expensive like Keels I like this brand a lot this is their micro dose retinol whereas their fast relief is a higher percentage this one here is 0.2 percent and much lower strength so if you're a beginner this is a great one but you also get some additional anti-aging benefits from the peptide in this topical peptides are great because they're self-signaling and they help increase collagen production through cell signaling so I like this one a lot one pump gives you that yellow retinol pea sides amount and you just use that to your entire face so that's a really nice retinol that's gentle now if you can't tolerate any retinol another thing you can consider that's anti-aging would be Heparin sulfate containing product like sente this is nice because this also has cell signaling capabilities increase College gent this is very gentle nice for those with rosacea and they can't use a retinol this is a good option but also an expensive brand but I say worth the price very gentle one pump gives you what you need for your face it comes out as a nice moisturizing cream a little thicker texture there soothing and also effective as well so I like that brand a lot they also came out with a new pigment correction kind of a mask you leave on for 15 minutes I have to review and I'm gonna try to get my hands on to that one but that one's also like 150 bucks for that I know some of you have asked to review that when I release my melasma video so I'm going to look into the brand sentence pigment corrector mask okay now going on to daily routine besides anti-aging what can you do I say have a gentle cleanser you don't have to go crazy with exfoliants lhas ahas bhas and your cleansers I think something gentle like vanic cream vanicream's a king when it comes to sensitive skin care and so their cleanser is great I love their daily facial moisturizers awesome so affordable you can find that Target your local drugstore or online on Amazon and so it's a great brand so reliable I even use that for my kids I use that as like a body wash for my kids and you can use this as a body wash as well their facial cleansers CeraVe is a good one they're hydrating facial cleanser and the winter time is also a great pick lasts forever get the big value size at Target or online and it lasts forever now if you wanted to talk about anti-aging and moisturizers and you can't do the retinol peptide moisturizers topical peptides like we talked about have self-signaling and so we mentioned that with the Keels retinol has peptide and also I forgot to mention Olay has the pomatoil pentapeptide four peptide complex which is also anti-aging the peptide moisturizer by the inkulus just do a little pump there and you can dispense the cream skin fix is another nice brand you can get at Sephora this is their triple lipid peptide cream which is also nice that I've used quite a bit also dispense by pushing on this and gets the cream out very good for sensitive skin now if you have irritation like myself around the cheekbones and you want to sue that I'm all about petrolatum based ointments and this is a small cute mini version of what you get as a tube CeraVe healing ointment and you just put just a small amount around your cheekbones at bedtime so that you don't wake up with a red face or redness on the cheekbones and that's my routine at night but right before I go to sleep get a good fresh layer of ointment over it whether it's Vaseline Aquaphor CeraVe healing ointment I love them all if you have a lanolin alcohol sensitivity or allergy stick with Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment Aquaphor has lanolin in it but it's quite a rare sensitivity or allergy so most people tolerate Aquaphor just fine another thing you can consider would be La Roche Posay secoplast bomb B5 this one has a B5 plus because I got this in Europe when I was in Paris but this is a great product you can get at your store but it has been selling out people on Tick Tock are using this on their acne lesions because it helps with wound healing but the ingredients in this don't actively fight acne it's more for healing has glycerin panthenol shea butter very soothing doesn't irritate my skin comes out as this paste you can put a small amount around your your cheekbones here you can layer it with your Aquaphor you can put this on first in Aquaphor Vaseline or CeraVe healing women over it but you see how it comes out as like this white paste but it does rub in well and then you get this kind of dewy finish here so totally fine to plan your face not comedogenic at all I like this one a lot this is a staple in my household ever since I discovered this let's talk about the most important thing sunscreen because sunlight will trigger acne rosacea flares and it's not good for those with sensitive skin because UV radiation will break your Skin Barrier up and make you more susceptible to allergens irritants and such I've talked about ltmd UV clear quite a bit on the channel this is nice because it has niacinamide in it and I like niacinamide containing sunscreens for those with rosacea and acne prone skin because it helps with the sebum but also inflammation comes in the tinted and non-tinted form tinted is great if you have hyperpigmentation as well this has zinc oxide and oxanoxate this is about 36 to 40 bucks though for 1.7 fluid ounces if you want a dupe something cheaper there's Dermatology this brand I've also talked about on the channel this is a Universal tinted moisturizer which is the dupe of the tinted Delta MD they're both SPF 46 they both have niacinamide this one though is a little over 20 bucks so much cheaper than this one and also 1.7 fluid ounces and comes out very nice lightweight one of my favorite sunscreens out so I'll just put a little bit here just to show you that it's a lighter tint very lightweight that it won't stain the inside of your mask as readily as the other tinted sunscreens out there very soothing good for sensitive skin moisturizing as well has some hyaluronic acid to help hydrate so I like this one a lot now in terms of other sunscreens besides tint you want to hide redness because this can help how you redness pretty well these lighter tinted sunscreens you can go for a Green Tinted sunscreen like Dr jar Dr jart sico pearline they have the color correcting cream with SPF or their tiger grass camel drops with SPF 44 this one's really nice almost looks like a matcha colored sunscreen here guess I'm running out but it's a nice one it's good to have Green Tinted products when you have rosacea because the green will help mask your read very well and you don't look green you don't look like the Hulk after it rubs in really well and hides so if you get a little redness around your nose you can put that sunscreen there Dr jard is a little bit more expensive but I say it's totally worth the price you got the zika in it which is soothing anti-inflammatory zika's really taken off recently and this is like K Beauty brand especially in the K Beauty World cintella asiatica has really taken off and it's very soothing so great for those with rosacea I'd say wear your sunscreen every day reapply especially if you're Outdoors reapply every couple hours if you're gonna get sweaty or exercise jump in the pool any kind of water activity you want to reapply every 40 to 60 minutes because your sunscreen will wash off pretty readily even if it's water resistant you got to reapply quite frequently if you're indoors and you're not by any window just wear your sunscreen in the morning before leaving the household and that should last you for the day if you are by a window glass though you should be technically reapplying every couple of hours because UVA will still come through the window glass and deactivate your sunscreen within a couple of hours okay so I hope this video helpful I had a lot of fun talking to you guys again about skin care and things you can do at home before you see me because a lot of times we have to prescribe prescription topical medicines or even oral medications for acne rosacea or rosacea and sometimes even do v-beam or pulse die laser for the redness the broken blood vessels we call pelandictasias see your dermatologist to talk about how to layer your prescription medicines and what medicines could work with your skin care products because we want them to interact and cause irritation as you know like we talked about it's a chronic condition without a cure so it's an ongoing battle and sometimes it's trial and error and azelic acid might work for one person and it might not work for the other patient so taking things slow trial and error being patient and not adding too many things at once taking things one step at a time okay so please hit the like button please subscribe to the Channel please share with your friends with sensitive skin and I'll see you guys for the next video guys okay take care peace foreign",

H: panthenol glycerin and hyaluronic acid so\u00a0\nthose are hydrating panthenol's a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 soothing as well niacinamide everyone's fave\u00a0\nbut not too much like five percent not 10 or 20 and then there's barrier support so we\u00a0\nhave ceramides cholesterol or you might\u00a0\u00a0 see phytosphingosine so that's a lipid\u00a0\nyou find in the outer layer of your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and it helps to give back to your skin\u00a0\nthose lipids that it's mainly missing then we have soothing ingredients so my faves\u00a0\u00a0 are definitely oat and also centella so\u00a0\n\"cica\" madecassoside and copper peptide M: so moving on to specific products I don't know if I told you this but your\u00a0\nserum actually made me realize how there\u00a0\u00a0 were lots of actives for irritated skin because\u00a0\nI used your serum and it was lovely on my skin and then I looked at the ingredients\u00a0\nlist and there was so much stuff in there so side note I did not invite Hannah onto this\u00a0\nvideo because she's my friend and I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 plug her serum we are going to talk about other\u00a0\nproducts but this was like a revelation to me so the serum is water-based and most of the\u00a0\ntime water-based serums really sting when my\u00a0\u00a0 skin barrier is compromised and this did not\u00a0\nit just felt so lovely so my mind was blown H: I feel like the oat is doing\u00a0\na lot of the lifting there my skin was stressed out while we were\u00a0\nworking on it so it was good for me to\u00a0\u00a0 test but what I wanted was something\u00a0\nthat would feel calming on contact I definitely did feel like there was a gap\u00a0\nthat was not much you could get especially\u00a0\u00a0 in Australia that would hydrate calm and support\u00a0\nyour barrier that didn't feel like thick and balmy M: I really love how lightweight\u00a0\nit is and how well it layers and\u00a0\u00a0 like just the fact that there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market I've been using this a few times\u00a0\na week even when my skin isn't\u00a0\u00a0 that irritated because it just\u00a0\nfits into my routine so nicely M: what are your other favorite\u00a0\nproducts for when your skin's irritated? H: I really like the la roche\u00a0\nposay cicaplast sheet masks you\u00a0\u00a0 put it on your face and it just\u00a0\nfeels calm it's hydrated it's\u00a0\u00a0 the best even after treatments you\u00a0\nknow when your skin feels really hot M: so I personally just don't really enjoy sheet\u00a0\nmasks because I don't like the feeling of them\u00a0\u00a0 sliding down my face so I love the cicaplast baume\u00a0\nB5 which is getting reformulated to the B5 plus I picked up one up in Europe and so far\u00a0\nit seems to be pretty similar on my skin\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a little bit lighter but I have\u00a0\nheard different things from other people a lot of people have told me that they really\u00a0\u00a0 like the cicaplast serum as well but I\u00a0\nhaven't tried that enough to really say there are a lot of other centella products that\u00a0\nare formulated for this sort of skin recovery\u00a0\u00a0 phase as well from brands like bioderma\u00a0\nand there's quite a few in K Beauty too H: I quite like NIOD's copper\u00a0\npeptide but the lipid which is\u00a0\u00a0 a sort of gel it's great because\u00a0\nsort of a one and done PM routine Beauty Bay make this moisturizer that's oat\u00a0\u00a0 it's called Thirst Class it's kind of a\u00a0\nbit richer so I would use it in winter M: yeah I think oat is just really underrated I\u00a0\nused to make this DIY oat mask back in the day\u00a0\u00a0 that was just ground up oatmeal mixed with\u00a0\nwater and I would just slap it on my skin it has a lot of hydrating actives and\u00a0\navenanthramides which are really soothing H: if you're fancy the Cosmetics\u00a0\n27 baume 27 which is sort of like\u00a0\u00a0 a healing oil balm really beautiful it\u00a0\nhas essential oils but they're chamomile\u00a0\u00a0 calendula those calming ones not the\u00a0\nhectic lavender or anything like that laneige cream skin beautiful\u00a0\ndoesn't have many ingredients M: I really love that one too\u00a0\nit's really lightweight and\u00a0\u00a0 less ingredients just cuts down\u00a0\nthat chance of skin reactions along the same lines with less\u00a0\ningredients but a bit heavier\u00a0\u00a0 there's also Vaseline and Aquaphor\u00a0\nwhich is mostly just petroleum jelly\u00a0\u00a0 and they're water free so there's\u00a0\nlike a lot less chance of stinging there's also CeraVe healing ointment\u00a0\nand the QV sting free ointment which\u00a0\u00a0 is like the Australian version of that\u00a0\nand they both have ceramides in them too I also really like using face oils\u00a0\nwhen I have that compromised skin\u00a0\u00a0 barrier because of the lack of water\u00a0\nit just doesn't tend to sting as much H: the paula's choice advanced\u00a0\nreplenishing toner I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 reminds me of laneige cream skin only\u00a0\nit's packed with antioxidants as well\u00a0\u00a0 so it can almost be your am serum\u00a0\nif you want a bunch of antioxidants I quite like my LED mask as well so I\u00a0\nhave one that's red and near infrared I\u00a0\u00a0 find when I use it regularly my skin is just\u00a0\nmore resilient and can tolerate more things I get a little bit tired in\u00a0\nthe evening so you just put\u00a0\u00a0 it on and then you've done skincare\u00a0\nand it's one less layer on your face M: I mentioned before that you have to avoid\u00a0\nretinoids exfoliants and vitamin C but there\u00a0\u00a0 are gentler versions of those so what is your\u00a0\npolicy on using these when your skin's irritated? H: it really depends for me on how irritated my\u00a0\u00a0 skin is but but I do have some\u00a0\ngentler versions of my actives la roche C10 is an example that\u00a0\none has 10% vitamin C but also\u00a0\u00a0 their neurosensine peptide and a\u00a0\nbit of salicylic acid so I have\u00a0\u00a0 literally never had an issue with that\u00a0\nproduct and I have issues with vitamin C and if I wanted a retinoid the kiehls\u00a0\nmicrodose it's enough to have an effect\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not enough to cause any issues so\u00a0\nthat's also a perfect beginner retinoid in\u00a0\u00a0 general and it has ceramides to\u00a0\nreplenish your skin as it works M: I also really like using derivatives of\u00a0\nvitamin C and A where my skin's irritated\u00a0\u00a0 because while there is less evidence\u00a0\nfor them working they are a lot gentler which I guess could be because they're not working\u00a0\nas well but it is like a nice fallback option my favorite less irritating derivatives for\u00a0\nvitamin C are ascorbyl glucoside magnesium\u00a0\u00a0 ascorbyl phosphate and thda or\u00a0\natip which are the same thing and for vitamin A I like granactive retinoid for gentle chemical exfoliation I like\u00a0\nusing polyhydroxy acids although I do\u00a0\u00a0 also sometimes use a very small amount of\u00a0\nsalicylic acid since it can be soothing but\u00a0\u00a0 you do have to be pretty careful because\u00a0\na lot of the formulas are quite harsh M: so one question I get asked a lot is\u00a0\nhow long do you generally have to wait\u00a0\u00a0 for your barrier to fix itself before\u00a0\nyou can go back to your usual products H: I am getting pretty good at repairing mine\u00a0\u00a0 and recognizing the signs before I\u00a0\ntruly obliterate it so a week or two recently I had a facial where it was an enzyme\u00a0\nexfoliant and it was like a bit scrubby and\u00a0\u00a0 I felt a bit tingly around the mouth I\u00a0\nthought it would be fine it wasn't fine the next few days it was tingly and so I\u00a0\njust cut the actives for about two weeks previous times has taken me three months M: that is so long yeah I think it is just a lot easier to not\u00a0\nmess up your skin barrier in the first place the longest my skin has taken is probably a week\u00a0\u00a0 or two but it depends a lot\u00a0\non the type of irritation so with perioral dermatitis\u00a0\nusually that is maybe a day or two if my nose is peeling off after a cold\u00a0\nthen that will usually be over a week now with cleansers which ones\u00a0\ndo you like for irritated skin? H: I like to use fragrance free cleanses and\u00a0\nit's because if your barrier is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 compromised then things get in further and so\u00a0\nthey wouldn't normally irritate you but they can I like avene extremely gentle cleanser\u00a0\nI like biologique recherche lait u that\u00a0\u00a0 is the one that's for oily skin but it's a cream and I like a really soft washcloth so like\u00a0\nthat really flammable fluffy polyester M: I also like fragrance free\u00a0\ncleansers where my skin's irritated some of my favorites are from geek\u00a0\nand gorgeous hada labo and bondi sands all of those don't really strip\u00a0\nskin and like you said they have\u00a0\u00a0 moisturising ingredients\u00a0\nthat give back to the skin I also really like using bioderma micellar\u00a0\nwater with soft reusable cotton rounds the bioderma was specifically designed and tested\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin and reusable\u00a0\ncotton rounds are just really soft M: now we are Australians so of course\u00a0\nwe have to talk about sun protection what is your approach when your skin's irritated? H: there are a couple of sunscreens\u00a0\nI know not to use because I can feel\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit spicy on the cheeks if my\u00a0\nskin is irritated but generally I will\u00a0\u00a0 look for one that is formulated for sensitive skin I really like those European pharmacy\u00a0\nbrands ends that cater to this type of skin M: yeah I think there is this sort of\u00a0\nassumption that you have to use zinc\u00a0\u00a0 oxide if your skin's irritated but\u00a0\nsometimes that's not the best option\u00a0\u00a0 and newer sunscreen filters\u00a0\ncan be really non-irritating if you go into like a French pharmacy\u00a0\nyou'll see that all of their sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin sunscreens are actually all chemical\u00a0\nsunscreens they have those newer filters some people actually find zinc oxide\u00a0\nmore irritating because it is drying\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite irritating when you're\u00a0\nrubbing it in because it's so thick\u00a0\u00a0 and sticky and also just trying to\u00a0\nget it off with cleanser at the end on top of that they're not always truly free\u00a0\nfrom chemical sunscreens I've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this before but there are these SPF boosters\u00a0\nthat are in a lot of mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\u00a0 they have almost identical properties to a\u00a0\nlot of properly approved chemical sunscreens I've actually talked to quite a few\u00a0\npeople now who have told me that they\u00a0\u00a0 react to some mineral sunscreens and\u00a0\nnot others and then they checked and\u00a0\u00a0 they saw that the ones that they do\u00a0\nreact to have butyloctyl salicylate M: right what other tips and tricks\u00a0\ndo you have for irritated skin? H: I think a lot of people don't know\u00a0\nthat your skin it exfoliates itself right it's called desquamation and it does that\u00a0\nbetter when it is adequately hydrated so\u00a0\u00a0 I would always try to hydrate my\u00a0\nskin before I try to exfoliate it if it's flaking or something\u00a0\nlike that and you might find\u00a0\u00a0 that the flakes take care of themselves that way I also really like doing several\u00a0\nlayers of one toner putting several\u00a0\u00a0 layers of one product on is better\u00a0\nthan putting four or five different\u00a0\u00a0 products right less opportunity\u00a0\nto upset your skin freak it out M: I also find that with flaky skin\u00a0\nif I have to get rid of them before\u00a0\u00a0 putting on makeup then I will wet my\u00a0\nskin and use a peeling gel very very\u00a0\u00a0 carefully and just buff in tiny circles\u00a0\nand that seems to do the least damage but that is like a really emergency sort\u00a0\nof thing I wouldn't recommend doing that\u00a0\u00a0 regularly when your skin is compromised because\u00a0\nthe hydration technique is just so much safer M: you also gave me some really good tips for\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis which is a newer issue for me it's a red rash that comes up around\u00a0\nyour mouth and near the sides of your\u00a0\u00a0 nose and it's been coming up\u00a0\nmore because of mask wearing the extra humidity can lead to an impaired barrier\u00a0\u00a0 and imbalance microbes and that can\u00a0\ncontribute to perioral dermatitis so I've had to change a few things when it flares\u00a0\u00a0 up like adding a cleanser in the\u00a0\nmorning which I don't usually do when my skin is happy then extra\u00a0\ncleansing tends to mess it up more\u00a0\u00a0 and dehydrate my skin but when that\u00a0\nperioral dermatitis is flaring then\u00a0\u00a0 my skin's already messed up so cleansing\u00a0\nactually takes it back towards happy M: do you have any other tips? H: if you think it might be perioral\u00a0\ndermatitis never put steroids on it\u00a0\u00a0 that's a Dr Cara-ism it's my beloved dermatologist perioral dermatitis it's like imbalanced\u00a0\nmicrobiome but also it can happen from\u00a0\u00a0 steroid withdrawal because the steroids\u00a0\nput your immune system to sleep a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit your immune system was there sort\u00a0\nof keeping the microbiome in check M: speaking of microbiome I found that I\u00a0\nsometimes get very superficial folliculitis\u00a0\u00a0 on my body when my skin gets irritated\u00a0\nso like after exercising and I'm sweaty\u00a0\u00a0 and my clothes have been rubbing in my\u00a0\narmpits and in like my crotchal region and it's usually worse when I'm a bit\u00a0\nrun down from stress and lack of sleep basically this is when bacteria infect your hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles and you get red bumps with pus\u00a0\nthat look like shallow inflamed pimples for these I like to use a benzoyl\u00a0\nperoxide cleanser most of these are\u00a0\u00a0 meant for the face but dermatologists have been\u00a0\u00a0 recommending it for body folliculitis too\u00a0\nand it's been working really well for me I use it right after I exercise\u00a0\nand also when I'm having a flare\u00a0\u00a0 and just also not marinating\u00a0\nin sweaty clothes helps a lot but if it's really deep and painful\u00a0\nand not going away then definitely see\u00a0\u00a0 a doctor because you might need antibiotics or\u00a0\nsomething or it could be just not folliculitis M: now rosacea I get asked about this a lot and\u00a0\u00a0 it's a bit of a confusing condition\u00a0\nthat not a lot of people talk about so what is rosacea? H: rosacea is a chronic inflammatory\u00a0\nskin condition it's basically my\u00a0\u00a0 dermatologist explained it to me as it's the blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels that are inflamed not the\u00a0\npores like you would have in acne you'll see visible blood vessels so those\u00a0\nlittle red ones are called telangiectasias\u00a0\u00a0 redness flushing so you'll see a symmetrical\u00a0\npattern of redness so mine comes and goes so you might get sort of a pimple like bump but it\u00a0\u00a0 won't be in the t-zone it will be around\u00a0\nthe cheeks and the nose in this pattern so it's like w zone not t-zone M: it gets confused a lot with acne and it\u00a0\ntends to show up from your late 20s onwards M: so how did you first\u00a0\nsuspect that you had rosacea? H: I was at an event and Dr Dennis\u00a0\nwas there and I said \"you know what\u00a0\u00a0 I'm always like flushing pink and red\u00a0\nthrough here sometimes through my cheeks what's going on? is that something I can treat?\" he's like \"well that's rosacea\" and I\u00a0\nwas like \"see ya\" I didn't want to know M: why should you actually\u00a0\nlook into managing rosacea? H: the thing about rosacea is that it progresses so you'll start with just the pink\u00a0\nand the flushing and maybe some\u00a0\u00a0 visible blood vessels around the nose\u00a0\nyou can get them in your cheeks too and then you'll start to get lesions\u00a0\nand you can also have it get into your\u00a0\u00a0 eyes and then it can progress\u00a0\nto thickened skin and swelling M: in terms of treating rosacea there\u00a0\nare over-the-counter options like\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid you should also\u00a0\nsee a dermatologist who has\u00a0\u00a0 experience with treating rosacea and\u00a0\nthey'll have other options available how else do you manage rosacea? H: Keeping on top of your skin barrier\u00a0\nand keeping that in check in place,\u00a0\u00a0 really supporting it is number one And avoiding triggers so you'll notice\u00a0\nwhen you start to flush from certain things the sun is a big one my skin hates the indoor heating - hates it alcohol some foods even spicy food is a big one\u00a0\u00a0 especially for like pale people\u00a0\nthat only eat meat and vegetables some medicines even do it your\u00a0\nskin care or makeup could do it M: I feel like in the skincare community we\u00a0\ntalk so much about acne but nowhere near as\u00a0\u00a0 much about rosacea so if any of this is\u00a0\nsounding familiar then you might want\u00a0\u00a0 to read up a bit on rosacea and\u00a0\nconsider getting it checked out I'll put some more resources in the\u00a0\ncaption and keep in mind that if you\u00a0\u00a0 have darker skin the redness will be harder to see I hope you enjoyed this nerdy chat if you did like the video to train the YouTube\u00a0\nalgorithm to give you more content like this also share any tips you have and leave\u00a0\nquestions for Hannah in the comments you can follow Hannah here she's also\u00a0\nwritten a great book and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 how much I'm getting out of it from all of my tabs I also have an ebook on skincare and I hope\u00a0\nthis video helps your skin be less grumpy at you",

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "rosacea is a condition i commonly see in clinics so in this video we're going to talk about what is rosacea how to best treat it and i'm going to offer some of my skincare tips for those of you who suffer from rosacea hi my name is dr jenny liu i'm a board certified dermatologist in minneapolis and welcome to my youtube channel so what is rosacea rosaceae is a chronic and inflammatory skin condition often characterized by skin sensitivity along with a tendency to flush and look rosy and red but also may develop pimple like bumps especially along the central face so the cheeks the nose the chin and the forehead and that is a very big definition of rosacea because we know that rosacea have various different presentations in fact we even used to categorize rosacea into four subtypes we still do for more academic purposes but for when we are seeing a patient in clinic we don't use those subcategories to really treat the patient we treat based on the clinical findings and the symptoms because we know for most individuals with rosacea they'll often have kind of a collection of various different subtypes number one is called erythrometal tylangitatic and that is the redness the flushing that we often see like the cheeks the nose the chin sometimes it can be very severe and large broken visible blood vessels can be present sometimes awareness often will flare with certain triggers and those triggers are different for everyone but common things would be heat wind cold spicy food stress chocolate caffeine all the good stuff subtype two is papular pustular rosacea so this is more than kind of what they used to call adult acne even though it's not truly acne but often gets misdiagnosed or mistaken for acne will present it is these pink zit or pimple like bumps and sometimes even pustules often on the nose the cheeks and the chin the third time is called phymatis and this has to do with chronic inflammation and over growth of your oil glands essentially often will present as more like a bulbous skin bulbous nose and that's called rhinophyma with uneven surface and texture with dilated pore like appearance but that feminist change can also be seen of the forehead as well as the chin and lastly the fourth subtype of rosacea is ocular rosacea and yes you can definitely get rosacea in your eyes often these patients will have like a dry and gritty like sensation grading the sensation in the eye sometimes eyelid margins can get crusty they can get styes and the whiteness of their eye can look more red and injected as i mentioned earlier most individuals will have a spectrum of these conditions and well being having the type 1 and type 2 so the flushing the redness along with pimples being the most common presentation that we see so why does rosacea happen you know unfortunately we are still trying to elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea so we don't completely understand it however we do know that it is very common affects 60 million americans and we often see it in like in the late 20s and 30s not so much in their kids and teenagers tends to present in adulthood now genetics do play a role in rosacea we tend to see this running in families as far as what is happening underneath the skin we do know that there are certain things that we see in rosacea patients that we don't see in individuals who don't have rosacea so number one there is a defective skin barrier and that could be a reason why often rosacea patients will complain that their skin is more sensitive either to products or to the environmental triggers there is increased interest epidermal water loss so the inability of the skin to hold on to water and tend to be more dry flaky and dehydrated we also know that there is actually a decreased amount of lipid production of the stratum corneum in rosacea patients similar there tends to be a an immunogenic so pro-inflammatory response for some reason and the inflammation will generate a cascade of reactions leading to production of enzymes that will generate inflammation but also can degrade collagen and we think that inflammation in part is what's responsible for the redness and those pimples that we see in rosacea patients furthermore there is what we call a neurogenic dysregulation so hypersensitivity along with again that clinical presentation that we see of being more sensitive to certain triggers and lastly there tends to be a hyper reaction to an organism that lives in the oil glands so there is a mite called demodex mite that we see in six percent of the normal healthy population there are these little bugs that you can actually even scrape out of the skin and put on a slide and clinic sometimes we'll do this and you can see these little prolly little critters and it's like i can't believe this just came out of my skin but in rosacea patients we found that there tends to be a higher density but not only is it the presence of these mites but we think in abnormal response to these mites is what is associated with the more popular and postular variant of rosacea now as mentioned earlier there can be common triggers for individual rosacea but one of the biggest risk factors is ultraviolet radiation we know that uv radiation is pro-inflammatory damages dna generates inflammatory response reactive estrogen cdc's and also upregulates all these inflammatory cytokines that already are pre-existing in rosacea patients that will often make that worse which is why it is super important to be doing thorough and diligent sun protection on a regular basis furthermore we know that in individuals who are more red and have dilated and broken blood vessels the sun often will make that worse so how we treat rosacea really depends on the presentation so if it's redness often lasers avoiding triggers certain prescription topicals can be helpful at temporarily reducing the amount of redness and obviously camouflaging is helpful when it comes to the papules or the pustules acne like bumps often prescription topicals and sometimes even oral medications are necessary for really severe cases i mentioned earlier oral antibiotics and sometimes even oral retinoids are used for severe cases but those overgrowth of sebaceous glands laser and certain type of procedures can be helpful next i'm going to offer some tips for general skin care and some of my personal favorite skin care products that i recommend for my rosacea patients the most important thing is if you do have rosacea is to see your dermatologist because like i said often prescription medications are really going to be helpful to help your rosacea get under control but nevertheless proper skincare is still going to be really really important and really the foundation as always you want to test out any products before using them and when it comes to skincare gentle is the way to go and less is more i recommend just a good gentle cleanser once or twice a day from cerave their hydrating cleanser vana cream facial cleanser is another really good one just find one that is going to be effective but not over strip your skin's natural oil now moisturizers are really going to be the key at helping to hydrate moisturize prevent trans epidermal water loss and really help to repair your skin barrier one of my favorite products is the one from cetaphil their redness relief night moisturizer this is very calming and soothing it contains ceramides niacinamide and shea butter and it's just a really good moisturizer and this is one of you that i have found that when my skin is like say recovering from a chemical peel and tends to be more sensitive it will not burn and has never burned my skin similarly another one that i personally love and use all the time is the two layering ultra moisturizing cream from la roche posay this is a thicker moisturizer contains glycerin thermal spring water shea butter and the neurosensing which is a peptide that they've actually done clinical studies on using this product on rosacea patients and has been found to have an anti-inflammatory and calming effects so this is one that i also really love one more moisturizer that i like especially to spot trace certain really irritated areas is the event sickle fades restorative cream and this is a zinc based zinc is really helpful for repairing skin it's used a lot in healing this is definitely kind of more white and pasty thick enough to even use on chapped lips if you need again something that can be really helpful soothing to the skin pretty thick so probably would use as needed to spot treat definitely can use it all over your face but i find that to be too a little bit too sick and heavy been occlusive and for those who want a lighter moisturizer either to use in the morning or if you have more oily skin the two that i've always recommended to my patients are one from cerave their pm facial moisturizer this is great i mean it says pm but it's lightweight it's oil free great to use under sunscreen in the morning in fact i do that sometimes as well as the laura's procedure and double facial moisturizer both of these are really helpful they're both oil free fast absorbing both contain ceramides and nice cinnamon that's gonna be helping to repair skin barrier and soothing so it's really just like a toss up i honestly love both and kind of will rotate through both of them depending on my mood now one last product that i have really been liking when my skin is just super sensitive is using an overnight sleeping mask one that i found to be really soothing and calming is the one from skin fix the redness relief overnight sleeping mask and this contains honey peptides and other calming ingredients and you wear it like a sleeping mask so you would wear it over your moisturizer and you will sleep in that it really helps to hydrate the skin repair the skin barrier and it's just very soothing and it really feels really good when you put it on your skin and it's kind of formulated for those with more sensitive red and rosacea prone skin so i would love to know if you've tried this please comment below and let me know what you think now i cannot finish off a rosacea video without talking and stressing the importance of wearing sunscreen i've talked about various types of my favorite sunscreens in my previous video and i will link some of my favorites that i think are well suited for rosacea prone skin down below in the description box but sunscreen is one of those no products that the best one is the one that you like enough that works well for your skin that you will remember and want to wear on a daily basis in general rosacea patients tend to tolerate mineral based sunscreen a little bit better just because often with this chemical sunscreen it can be more irritating and can burn but i have found a handful of mario's tissue patients including my skin that tends to be sensitive can tolerate certain types of chemical sunscreens it really all depends on the formulation here is where you have to try you want to make sure you're putting on enough most people under apply so at least a teaspoon for your head and neck reapply it throughout the day and this is really important because we do know that ultraviolet radiation come through windows and most of us because we under apply and your sunscreen gets rubbed off throughout the day that is going to make a huge difference when it comes to protecting your skin so really make sure that you are reapplying using the proper amount so those are some of my favorite skincare recommendations i hope you guys found this video helpful and let me know if you have rosacea if you have tried any of these products that i've recommended i'd love to hear what you think about them similarly if you have a holy grail product that i did not mention today comment below because i would love to try them out myself and hopefully recommend them to my patients as well if you enjoy watching this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel again you can follow me on my various social media accounts until next time thanks

        "transcript": "[Music] hello my name is dr sam ellis and i am a board certified dermatologist welcome to my bathroom in addition to practicing both medical and cosmetic dermatology in northern california i am also an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at uc davis and i'm a consultant for skin care companies and i help them develop products that are evidence-based tonight i am going to be taking you through my anti-aging skincare routine [Music] now a lot of people kind of bristle at the anti-aging term and what i mean is not that i don't want you to be getting older as a physician i i want to get older i want my patients to be getting older because the alternative is not great but you might not want your skin to look weathered or tired i want my skin to be plump and youthful and healthy and that is what this skincare routine is all about but in sort of a low maintenance streamlined way all right we've got the towel on the hair is back we are ready to rock and roll with a nighttime skincare routine a little bit of background about my skin is that it's not particularly oily it is not particularly dry it is somewhat sensitive because i have a skin condition called rosacea which makes me prone to redness and flushing especially with a glass of wine but i don't get the pimples that some people with rosacea do get which is really lucky for me but i do have to be mindful that some products do irritate my skin and that i'm a little bit more sun sensitive i also spent my whole life outside i'm from california i was a swimmer and i played water polo through college so i have a lot of sun damage that i have been working on for the past several years but that is also something that i'm trying to tackle in my nighttime skincare routine so the first step of any skincare routine in the evening is going to be cleansing your skin the whole point of this is to remove all of the junk and debris that have built up on your skin over the day maybe take off makeup or sunscreen not or sunscreen definitely sunscreen if you don't have sunscreen on your face we're gonna have a problem but you need something to take that all off because if that's just sitting on your skin while you sleep that's gonna clog your pores make you more prone to breakouts it's going to make your skin look dull so you need to cleanse that off and the other part of cleansing that's important is that it sets your skin up to absorb and interact with the next set of products that you're going to put on it i am a huge fan of the double cleanse and i feel like if you're watching this you probably know what a double cleanse is but for those who don't the double cleanse is basically a two-step cleansing process where you use a more oil-based cleanser to remove that top layer of debris that's on your skin and break up some of the product and then you use a second cleanser usually a water-based cleanser to wash that all away so today i am going to be using the clinique take the day off cleansing balm as my first cleansing step it's not waxy it's almost creamy but holds its shape and then as you put it into your hands you can see the warmth from the body just melts it all away but all that product is still sitting here and i'm going to massage it into my face and the whole point is to really just break up that product and you can start to see my tinted moisturizer coming off you can see that redness of my skin underneath but i like to see the redness because then i know that my makeup is getting removed so i usually will take this up onto my forehead in the eyebrows i usually grab a little bit more for my eyes i feel like breaking up the eye makeup is so important you don't want today's mascara to become tomorrow's eyeliner because if you've ever fallen asleep with your makeup on you know what i'm talking about and if you haven't then that probably made zero sense to you so i'm just massaging really gently and delicately around this i'm going over my eyelashes and really trying to press the product down and away in a second i'll peek and see what kind of scary mess i've created oh yeah that's good that's really good and so at this point everything's broken up i'm gonna get it wet i'll just get my fingers damp and then we do something called an emulsifying process where i add a little bit of water to the product and you can see it turns kind of white and creamy and that really helps with the cleansing that water grabs onto the product and the product grabs onto the dirt and oil and makeup and sunscreen and lotion that's on your face and now i'm going to dip down and cleanse see in a second got all of that cleansed off and now i'm ready for my second step of the double cleanse but you can see like i don't really have eye makeup on anymore you can start to see the texture and the color of my skin meaning that i feel confident that my makeup has been removed with that step for my second step i'm going to use the vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin i hope there's some still in here i use this a lot yeah we're good so this cleanser is sort of like a pearlescent gel i really like it i feel like i need a lather in my facial cleanser at least one of the steps i might have been brainwashed by the cosmetic industry i don't care to me this makes it feel like something is really happening i like this cleanser because it's sort of a no-nonsense it's not an exfoliating cleanser it's really just the purpose is to get your face clean so i just kind of massage it go down my neck normally i would do this stuff in the shower so usually i would do my cleansing balm emulsify it and then hop in the shower wash my face and body in the shower and then come back out and do the rest of my routine but if i take this into the shower this video is going to take on a whole nother life so this is all massaged in go over my eyelashes one more time make sure everything's really good drop back down it's going to rinse it off all right so the face has been cleansed and when i'm done cleansing my face i don't want it to feel dry or tight but i also don't want it to feel oily or particularly hydrated yet i just need it to feel ready to accept whatever i'm going to put on it next i feel like if your skin is feeling too dry or tight after you cleanse you might need to switch your cleanser either to one that has a lower ph so something in the five to six range sometimes a more basic cleanser that sits more at the seven to eight range and the ph can be more stripping for the skin and although some skin can handle that a lot of people can't and so that's one thing to look for in your cleanser if you're noticing you're feeling really dry the other thing is that you can look for ingredients like glycerin or shea butter in your cleanser because those are hydrating ingredients that can support your skin while you wash once i've cleansed i'm in the home stretch that is honestly the thing that takes the longest in my entire routine the next thing i'm going to do is put on my trusted tretinoin so this is a retinoid this is a prescription strength retinoid and you can see this tube is very well loved so well loved that i am worried about getting some out of the tube right now a little more all right we're good pea sized amount that's all you need it takes me a while to get through one of those tubes because that's all you need for your entire face so when i'm putting a retinoid on i do the dot method i think this is not new for any body but that helps me sort of distribute it but a little goes a really long way with this product i just put any extra that's on my fingertips kind of down my neck the neck skin is so much more sensitive than facial skin because it does not have the same density of hair and oil glands that the face has so it doesn't have the same repair abilities and so you have to be really careful with the neck because you go in with 0.05 tretinoin and you might be sorry the other thing i will sometimes use on my neck is like a retinol so a retinol is a not prescription strength retinoid it is something that's weaker than tretinoin because it has to be converted in the skin into retinoic acid it has to be converted into tretinoin and therefore in that conversion it gets weakened quite a bit and so sometimes i'll go in with that on my neck or even around my eyes i don't want to spend too much time talking about retinoids even though they are amazing because you could probably find a million excellent videos here that go into more detail but essentially retinoids are vitamin a derived compounds that are the best thing you can do to anti-age your skin in terms of product besides wearing sunscreen which is in a category and a class all on its own so retinoids which include things like retinol retinal adaptolene teseratine triferitine tretinoin they can be over the counter or prescription and they do it all they support collagen synthesis so they help you make new collagen which makes your skin bouncy and glowy and less saggy fewer fine lines fewer wrinkles they help break up pigmentation in the skin they support new vessel growth and a lot of people are like oh i don't want new vessels but deeper in the skin which can really make your skin glow the other thing that they can do is they can actually fight something called cellular atypia so as your body is exposed to more uv damage over your life the cells in your top layer of skin can start misbehaving and that's what leads to skin cancer so as part of a skin cancer prevention treatment i put a lot of my patients on a topical retinoid retinoids increase collagen synthesis so collagen is the protein in our skin that makes it look bouncy and glowy and in our mid-20s we lose one percent of our collagen in our skin per year which is devastating so how do we combat that using a retinoid is the best way and that is why it is a staple in my routine it will never leave my routine unless i was trying to get pregnant or if i was pregnant the reason for that is that these are vitamin a derived compounds and they have been shown when taken orally to cause birth defects so no anti-aging in the world is worth a birth defect a lot of people will caution about using retinoids when someone's breastfeeding i personally would have no problem using a retinoid while i'm breastfeeding i'm not worried about a birth defect at that point the baby is out so just don't put it on your nipples and you'll be fine so most nights i will use a retinoid maybe once or twice a week depending if i feel like my skin is looking dull or if i just want to like a little extra i will do an exfoliating step instead of my retinoid i never use a chemical exfoliator plus a retinoid in the same night that is too much and overkill but one of my favorite chemical exfoliants are these peel pads by skin better they are a combination of lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid and then their own proprietary retinoid blend but when you take one of these and you swipe it over your face you get the sting okay that's the sting that tells you something's going down on your skin in a positive way i would not recommend doing a retinoid and this in the routine unless you're used to it basically otherwise you're going to over exfoliate your skin you're going to over aggravate your skin but for me i've been using a retinoid for six or seven years at this point and i need another exfoliating agent to just get some of that dead skin cell layer off the top so i can have a true glow and doing a peel pad or some type of exfoliating step usually a chemical exfoliating step not a physical scrub is what i like to do in my routine to just give me a little glow next after my retinoid is on i go in with a moisturizer this is the la roche-posay tolerane ultra this is a super mild but very hydrating moisturizer this is like five pumps i want a lot okay this is super thick and creamy it's basically like a pumpable cream usually i tell patients creams come in jars they're thick like frosting this is just just below that it is the thickest lotion you can imagine and i i adore this now it's on the back well this is going to be really smooth tomorrow but i probably use four or five times more moisturizer than i do of a retinoid i want more of it oh it just feels so good i like this because it feels really nourishing and no matter how angry or upset or if my rosacea's flared or if i overdid it with my retinoid and my skin feeling temperamental this never ever stings and i really appreciate that about this product i also see a lot of patients in my clinic who have sensitive skin who have allergies to things like fragrance or certain preservatives and this product just doesn't have any of those so i always feel really confident recommending it to people with sensitive skin because i think they'll be successful the only time i might not use something this sick is someone who's really acne prone who has a ton of clogged pores because it does have a lot of moisturizing and occlusive ingredients in it but oh i love it feels so good all right so retinoid is on moisturizer is on that's it it's the one two punch i mean it's pretty darn simple i do use something called azelaic acid in the morning to help combat my rosacea and i use vitamin c and sunscreen but in the evening for anti-aging retinoid and moisturizer now i don't exclusively rely on my skin care to contribute to my anti-aging plan or goals i do use neuromodulators so botox in my face to help with fine lines and wrinkles and creasing that happens over time i also do a mild resurfacing laser a few times a year something called clear and brilliant which helps break up pigment in my skin and also supports collagen synthesis the last thing i do is something called pulse dye laser so pulse dye laser is a laser that targets redness and you're probably looking at me going well i can see redness in your face oh you you can't even imagine what it would look like without the laser okay uh these tools that we have in a dermatology office are not to help someone achieve true you know there's no such thing as perfect we're just trying to optimize make someone feel more confident you don't need to look like an instagram filter that's not even a realistic goal you just need to look like you and feel confident in your own skin and sometimes a little enhancement never hurts anybody but i just want to be totally just totally transparent and that i get support from in-office procedures and i don't exclusively rely on my skin care if you're someone that does bravo but if you're someone who doesn't bravo to round out my nighttime skincare routine we cannot neglect the lips oftentimes i'll actually put my moisturizer on over my lips as well just to start softening them and then i'll go in with something more occlusive so something with a more jelly like or vaseline texture to really lock everything in so i'm going to use my aquaphor oldie but a goodie as you can see that's like a pretty thick i mean it's 40 vaseline or petrolatum excuse me and so i'll just put that on my lips to get everything nice and hydrated the rest i rub on my cuticles so in a clinic day you know i see 20 to 35 patients in a day and i wash my hands probably a hundred times that's sadly not even an exaggeration and so my hands take a huge beating so part of my nighttime routine focuses on my hands so anytime i showed you any of these steps any leftover got rubbed down my neck on and onto the back of my hands and that's really important to me but now i've got my retinoid on my moisturizer on the skin has been properly cleansed the lips are feeling juicy i think i'm getting ready to go to bed that's it thank you so much for following along in my nighttime anti-aging low maintenance skincare routine i just wanted to show you that even as a dermatologist who has access to all of the things this is what i choose now just because that's what my routine is it doesn't mean that's what your routine has to be but you should know that you can work smarter not harder and that an effective skincare routine does not have to be extensive or expensive it can be if you want it to but it certainly doesn't have to be if you would like more skincare tips from me and just to follow me around the office see what the day in the life of a dermatologist is like hear me talk about dermatologic procedures and medical dermatology you should follow me on instagram my handle is super creative it's at dr samantha ellis i would love to see you there this has been a blast and a huge honor thank you so much for having me bye",

        "transcript": "hello everyone my name is abby bliss white and welcome back to my channel today i'm going to share my top moisturizers for mature rosacea prone skin so you guys I am 50 years old my have mature skin obviously along with I have rosacea prone skin I don't necessarily consider it completely sensitive when my skin is in good shape and I'm keeping things at bay ie not irritating my skin and keeping that skin barrier in shape my skin would probably be considered normal to dry more on the dry side as I've gotten older but I wanted to share with you my creams that I have used in the past my moisturizers that I'm currently using and tell you why I like that and you know what if they might work for you so I have to be a little bit careful about certain ingredients in my products so a lot of these you will notice there's a theme of trying to keep them you know not too irritating or disruptive so let's go ahead if you're interested in hearing these suggestions and recommendations then let's go ahead and dive in so currently I am using at night time my doctor Barbara Sturm rich face cream her face cream rich you guys I absolutely love this face cream it is just absolutely amazing and plumping and it is a sensitive skin girls dream I just found that it was not irritating whatsoever because another thing that I found is that sometimes too rich of a cream would give me you know would also irritate my skin barrier ie give milia or something like that so it kind of has to be on that fine line where you want that hydration those ceramides and all that kind of goodness but without overdoing it with your skin you guys this stuff really is so hydrating I'm getting very sad because I am getting down to the bottom I literally use this at night I am currently also layering this with her hyaluronic acid serum so when I wake up my skin just feels so hydrated plump and I just love it so the consistency you guys is just going to be a nice kind of cream but it does not feel heavy on your skin so that is what I would say I like about it it feels rich and luxurious but then it sinks into your skin and feels absolutely amazing and it does feel very hydrating so that's one thing I will say is you get the hydration benefits right off the bat the secret ingredient to her products is purslane which is a highly effective anti-inflammatory ingredient so her whole line has some sort of purslane in there products and again this is an anti-inflammatory herb that she puts in her products and it seems to be very calming soothing to the skin and again then it has hyaluronic acid in here it just honestly is a really nice rich face cream and I love this at night I do not need to use this in the morning because it is a little bit of it is rich now I have tried a sample of just her face cream that's for the day and I will tell you that was lovely as well I wasn't looking for that I was looking for something when I'm going to invest in a cream that's kind of like that rich face cream that I was looking for at night I decided to go with this one because that's what I really like to kind of layer on the hydration at nighttime so I cannot I highly recommend this once I finished this I'm on the fence you guys as to whether or not there's another cream I'm going to talk about that I want to purchase and again would love your recommendations but I would say yes I would repurchase I'm not sure if I'm going to do that right away because I might try something in-between but I love this cream it is very hydrating and amazing um another one that someone had asked if I would share what had helped with their skin barrier like repair work and one of the things that honestly I have to give kudos to was before I used this as my night cream I was using biologic with cherche creme mask her necks you guys this one is an empty so I don't even have I think you can see a little bit of this because it is a yeasty colored mask and I use this as a sleeping mask and it does not smell good but it is very reparative to your skin so this has some yeast extracts in this very soothing calming to the skin there vernix is supposed to be kind of like when you're born you come out with that layer of coating that's like keeps the baby have that beautiful baby skin this is what this is mimicking and you do when you're using this at night I would put this on at night and sleep in it and it felt very much like you almost get a sheen of wax enos on your skin but when you wake up your skin is just lovely plump hydrated and you guys this is what I was saying when I originally started getting into logic research and getting recommendations for my skin with I was having a rosacea outburst okay and I get it right up on my cheeks and again against a lot of things with rosacea has to do with your internal diet um so it's not all just the products you use I was having some hormonal imbalances and I really needed to kind of up my gut health so I was doing it to fold so I can't say this completely saved my skin but the combination of doing some internal work with my diet and supplements also helped and along with this really helped prepare my skin barrier where I'm feeling like I'm in a good part I'm in a good zone at the moment knock on wood but this I would highly recommend very soothing and amazing um another cream that I'm out of but that I really thoroughly enjoyed and yes I would recommend but it is extremely pricey is the biologic ressure SH creme MS our each you guys this was just another really lovely rich hydrating do we like kind of smelled like vanilla this is just a lovely cream to use and you could use this day and night be this was recommended to me during the day and these two lasted a very long time because I was using one in the a.m. and one in the PM I am taking a teeny bit of a break I will most likely buy another one of these because I want to have it on hand this I really enjoyed but again this was a pricey kind of treat that I treated myself during Christmas time with and you know I I'm not saying I'll never buy this again but it wasn't a repeat purchase for me at the time lovely texture I definitely going to recommend this for people who are on the older you know need that hydration are worried about you know sun damage wrinkles hydration all of that that's what I would say so this is a lovely get it's definitely a splurge but a lovely one okay a couple more affordable more options and that I've gone through several tubes up so before kind of veering into biologically cherche I always like to spend my money on serums so I have no problem you know diving in spending money on serums sometimes with moisturizers you know what a lot of times if I will buy something I'm not saying this is cheap but I'm saying this is a little bit more affordable is the drunk elephant la la retro whipped cream you guys this is like $65 versus $300 so again major splurge but this guy here very hydrating moisturizing did not upset my skin I think I still have some of this guy yes okay so number one as I said before drunk elephant does an amazing job with packaging has exactly the amount that you should be using this is just a super rich hydrating cream I absolutely love it and you guys I literally I don't know how many tubes of that tubs of that I have bought before this was just kind of like my basic awesome hydrating moisturizer and it has six rare African oils it's a whipped oil and it did not upset my skin whatsoever now speaking of which then came out the protein II polypeptide creme and again you guys I bought several of these guys and I love this as well I'm out of this guy [Music] this guy you guys I love this polypeptide cream I would totally recommend it totally buy it again but since I'm a junkie I will cycle through different moisturizers and so I'm trying a couple other things right now but I will tell you that my daughter is using my la la retro right now and also I will purchase another one maybe even during the upcoming Springs Sephora sale because this is just a great multi-purpose very hydrating cream at one point it was saying you know take half a pump of this and then a half a pump of that and mix them together do I like one better than the other I like the idea that this was sort of like your protein for your skin and that it had some more lifting kind of that firming benefits to it and then this one I feel like is just your pure hydration so I'm you guys they're just great I don't think you could go wrong with either one I would go and test and see which one felt more moisturizing to you if you are looking for like pure on hydration really great love those what I'm currently using in the am right now is the Angie Angela kaalia souffle moisturizer paired with the luxurious face oil so again you guys I really like that kind of layering effect this has been lovely so I was kind of on the fence on buying these products I wasn't sure about a few of the essential oils in these products but these are again the the souffle moisturizer is actually meadow Foam seed oil goat milk and willow bark extract all three of those are very soothing and comforting to the skin you guys a little of this goes a long way it is right here I just use a little piece I'd emphasize and I think the difference the reason I use in the morning is that it has a very light layer let me see if you can see it is not sick it is like almost a light lotion but it is so moisturizing you guys literally just sinks into your skin I love it and this one you guys it doesn't have any sort of scent or anything like that it's it's definitely a clean product and absolutely lovely now the way I like to do this is I'd like to take a few drops of her luxurious face oil because I have drier skin and feel like I like again I like a little bit more of a dewy look anyways I take a couple drops of her oil which by the way again very lovely I think this is just an awesome oil sinks right in I like to mix the two together so that gives me a little extra hit of moisture to my skin and again that one does have a little bit I would say of a kind of clean medicinal scent nothing over the top and I have had no rosacea outbursts whatsoever were using these products so this is what the combination that I'm using currently in the morning and I'm absolutely enjoying that what's very much so now another one that I use often at night and sometimes I will spot treat in the morning and it's worth mentioning to you guys I love the May Lindstrom blue cocoon beauty balm I generally will use this more at night because it is the most amazing smelling balm you will ever smell I seriously there's I would love it if she put it in a perfume I would totally wear this it has this blue tanzy it is just it is amazing so if you're not familiar with me Lindstrom's she literally is a total artist chemist with beautiful products not all of them worked for my skin I use the entire line for a but it was almost a little bit too much for my skin the beauty the blue cocoon mom I feel I honestly have to tell you I've had this for years now a little goes a long way but if my skin is kind of erupting or feeling like having it's having a little moment isn't on its best behavior I take a little bit of this balm I make sure that my face is misted with some sort of facial mist or just even just like a van water then I take the balm and then I will rub a little bit of this balm and use that as my moisturizer you guys it is so awesome I also love to use this as my eye cream this is one that someone was asking me what my favorite eye creams are I oftentimes use this little guy because it's just such a treat because at night time it smells so amazing I swear it just lulls me to bed so having a little bit up kind of by my temple area I swear it just relaxes me overall I love to wear it on my neck and it's a little bit on my decollete just kind of as a calming lovely beauty balm so this is another one I would say for creating that skin barrier and that repair a little of this always will just call my skin go down now the key is don't use too much in the beginning I actually had to reach out to the company in May Linstrom actually wrote back I'm pretty sure it was her oh and gave me some tips and trips and treat that gave me some tips in tricks of how to properly use this unless is more so absolutely cannot this would be definitely on the skin repair bits like skin repair cream that I would recommend and have used for years now a new addition is the tatcha dewy skin cream I got several of you that we were enticed like I was you guys I really do love the brand touch I I was telling you I have used a lot of their products in the past and one of their moisturizer that's so popular is the water frame and their other one they tend to be more gel based they're not quite hydrating enough until this little guy came along and it is number one beautiful purple it is just so beautiful sick luxurious and I now have been kind of alternating between my Angela kaalia and this in the morning because you guys it gives you such a dewy gorgeous skin so number one it's rich beautiful but it's going to melt right into your skin and I just feel like it gives you this little layer I don't know if you can see here but it gives you when it says dewy it's not greasy it's just this kind of healthy hydrated plumping beautiful cream I love it so if you are starting your list for Sephora and you are you know will have this on your wish list I do have to say you say have not been using this long but absolutely love it has not irritated my skin so one thing I'm going to tell you is when I do get these kind of outbreaks I will start in my cheeks I will get little red dots I will fill in Qing my skin will tell me if it doesn't like something pretty quickly so this has not been causing me issues I'm loving it and I'm definitely glad that I succumb to the beautiful purple color okay one thing that I'm going to share that I used to love but I had to give it a pass because of the fragrance but I do have to say you guys I pulled this out I can't seem to let go of this cream because I loved it for so long but then when I did have a rosacea breakout I did have to pull back with anything with fragrance and unfortunately this caudally premier cream crew love creme riche riche has fragrance in it I actually think it comes up as clean on Sephora I'm gonna look at that real quick hold off okay this you guys it has a scent and I was just trying to find out if this has synthetic fragrance or if this just has it looks like this is getting the clean at Sephora because it's using more of a natural fragrance but let's just say you guys I can smell it from here you guys it's so amazing so this was this I guess I love a rich cream so I this was love at first sight I was I think I vodka several times at blue mercury they had some totally person come in and I got to get a little facial from them and they used the code early products and you guys oh my gosh this is just like this rich wonderful amazing cream but at some point my skin started reacting and I you know what I just need to wear this as perfume every day because it is I love the smell so much if you've ever smelled they also have a they used to pair this with their there's a coat a leave crew oil precious oil and it just you guys I literally they put that precious oil and then they put a little bit of this on my skin and it was just I think I just bought it because I just smelled so oh good oh I love the smell of these products so I have had to put this to the side I may bring it out and test it now that my skin is not irritated because again when I get rosacea outbursts it's not often just the product there's something going on hormonal II with my body and such and so I kinda have to tink around that way but this gets an honorable mention as far as something I really really enjoyed for many many a year I just love that if you are looking for something that's thick and rich it kind of has the same this is a little bit lighter but it has that luxurious feel this one's gonna feel a little bit more waxy ER so I tended to like to use this at night if you do use it during the day it totally works but you will have that little Dew enos on your skin that kind of a little bit I don't want to say waxy sounds like a bad a bad you know description of that but you will definitely have it doesn't just completely sink into your skin so this is honorable mention for any of you that have no issues with some of those fragrance I would definitely get a sample before trying this because I just that was one of the things that I did have to cut back on but I do have to tell you it is a lovely moisturiser super thick wonderful and it smells like a dream so you know what I'm gonna start wearing this as my daily perfume moisturize our perfume to use this guy up because I just can't give it up because it smells so lovely and you know what that's very preference I some people probably would smell this and be like OOP that's old lady smell it doesn't smell like old lady but it definitely has a scent to it so okay okay you guys I hope this was helpful the last cream that I am interested in purchasing and I'm kinda thinking I might do that to replace my doctor Barbara Starr rich cream is buying the truth treatment system the omega-6 cream so many of you guys have written me I was on the fence as to whether to buy the transdermal sea bomb or the omega-6 and you guys I'll do little pictures up here above both of them if you have used them I would love to know which one you recommend I have been talking to Mandi Davis at MU Amanda Davis anyway if she was saying you know I kind of was like well do I need to buy both of them do you think I need to and she was kind of saying I don't think you need to buy both she was saying that if your skin is more like pili and you need more rest or restorative properties and stuff go with the omega-6 like especially if you're more sensitive to retinol which I am and you want to prevent some of the peeling that might happen by using the retinol to go with that omega-6 that is what the way dr. Fuchs kind of pairs the retinol with that omega-6 and then in the morning that he's pairing the C serum with that transdermal seed bomb I am just not sure I'm going to like to be using a bomb on days when I'm putting makeup on I tend to really like to use something like this that is going to give me a good canvas for makeup because I personally love makeup and wear it daily if you don't then I think maybe that transdermal C might be wonderful I don't know since I haven't tried them but that is where my mind is going as I definitely want to pick up the his truth treatment hyaluronic acid serum I've heard it's as good as the dr. Barbara's term for a fraction of the cost and then one of those creams or maybe even both because I don't know which one I want but that's kind of where I'm leaning but all of these creams I'm talking about with the exception of this guy right here is something that I would buy and repurchase again and I have requests just several of these so those are the ones I wanted to share with you now because I feel very confident and recommending those to you and again I would love any I would love to hear what your favorite ones are because as a junkie I love to know what's next on the horizon so you guys thank you so much for watching and I hope this was helpful I will be back with another video soon",

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "published_at": "2021-05-02T18:55:31Z",
        "transcript": "hi and welcome back to scents and sensitivity today i'm going to talk about moisturizers that i've been testing out lately ones that are working and ones that aren't so it's a updated moisturizing video just like i recently did my updated cleansing video so if you've seen my videos in the past you know that i love moisturizers the past decade or so you've we've all seen like this really big transition to people using oils using lots of serums especially hyaluronic acid serums and things like that and kind of blending serums with oil however i haven't found any suitable substitute for my skin anything that substitutes using a lotion or a cream so while i will sometimes use a serum or an oil in addition i never skip a cream or a lotion it's just what works best for my skin and it's also really good to have around because i feel like when my skin is really reactive gently cleansing and then using a very bland moisturizer and that's it um is the way to go for me and is the best thing to help set my skin back on track and adding in any of those additional products or especially a serum that's active is not what i'm going to do at that point if i'm having a reaction so i love creams i think they're kind of getting a bad rap some places but i love them so i've talked to you guys about this in the past it's the svr scentsy fiend ar creme and i'm not using this one so much anymore but i do think this is a fantastic product this is one of the first products i use that actually really helped um reduce the heat and burning sensation in my skin and i think it does help with reduction in redness a little bit it's a light formula even though this is the heavier one and it's light green in color let's see i'll rub it in it's very thin um no scent the green disappears immediately i don't find that that has any redness neutralizing effect but i do think it does a really good job with that heat sensation which is what it's claim is um what else is good about this is it's silicone free so if you're somebody who avoids silicones this would be a great one to try you can get it i think amazon is selling it now um but they don't sell it in stores in the states so you do have to search it online but i love this product i haven't been using it as much because i've been needing heavier products more rich and moisturizing products and i find this to be rather light so it's not enough for me on my own but i think if you have skin that tends towards the normal to oily side or you live in a more humid climate this might suit you nicely the next cream i've been using for several months now is the la roche posay toleran ultra soothing repair moisturizer and you can see i'm almost done with it um and i really really like this i love the packaging it's airless which means they don't have to put as many preservatives in it because no air gets into the product which is what oxidizes and turns products bad which is why we need preservatives so i think that's really cool i like that the pump blocks it's nice for travel and i think this is a great simple product i switched to this because my skin was feeling very dry we've been having extremely dry weather in southern california and i've also been having more sensitivity and reactivity in my skin so i wanted to strip things back and go really basic so actually what i did for a while was layer these two so i'd put this on after cleansing especially focusing in my cheek area which um get the reddest and the most heat sensations and then i would top it off with about two pumps of this i because i'm so careful in my cleansing process i don't need to use as much moisturizer as i see like some youtubers use um so when i see people doing seven eight pumps of this um maybe for some people that's necessary also the the size of your face you know the amount of skin you need to cover of course that plays into it too but i do question what those people are just like what is their cleansing routine like and is it drying their skin to the point that they're needing this excessive amount of moisturizer to rebalance the skin one of the best cleansing videos i've ever watched was um posted on into the gloss i'll link it below it's on their youtube channel and it's of a french esthetician isabel bellis is her name and she works for the skincare brand slash esthetician named joelle ciocco and they are very famous i a lot of um famous people go to them things like that but her cleansing video is really really helpful to understand how to cleanse the skin properly as well as what your skin should feel like at the end and then they did a moisturizing video as a secondary to that one and you'll see she uses very little moisturizer and she talks about how with your cleansing process if you find the right process that balances out your skin you won't need that much moisturizing and you don't want to overload your skin you put just enough so i know that was a tangent but i can't really talk about skincare moisturizing or anything else without talking about cleansing because it is the foundation in my opinion it is the thing that um makes the biggest difference besides eliminating ingredients that are irritating from your products in my opinion so what can i say about this it's soothing it's hydrating it's creamy it's i would say medium to rich it's not super rich it doesn't feel super occlusive you're not gonna put this on and start sweating like it feels like a glove or a mask on your skin it absorbs well um it does have silicones in it so i will say that if you're avoiding silicones for whatever reason you know this won't be a good choice for you but um my skin doesn't seem to be negatively affected by silicones so i you know i wanted to try this out and i think it's very good i will repurchase this so highly recommend that as the weather kept getting drier and drier i actually needed even more moisturization than that and part of the issue is and i talked about this in my recent cleansing video i tried a foaming cleanser for about a week and a half and that actually really dried out and irritated my skin so to repair it i switched from this combo to this plus this and this was another new find this is also la roche posay this is also a very popular product that's talked about a lot in blogs and forums and reddit in the rosacea community and it is the la roche-posay sika plast bom b5 and i had not tried this in the past um i think because i was just you know interested in other things and i didn't have dry flaky skin but after using this foamy cleanser i was starting to get these flaky patches and with the dry weather i needed something more protective and i had researched and read that this was really good to protect against wind burn and things like that which you know i i was basically feeling that that was the equivalent to what was going on because it's like that idea of trans epidermal water loss where the water is getting sucked out of the skin and flaking the top layers of the epidermis so i needed something more occlusive and more protective so i went ahead and purchased this and tried it and i think it's fantastic it's actually been doing a really good job at not only healing the dry skin i had and keeping me much more moist and supple but also reducing redness which i you know didn't anticipate as a side effect so it has panthenol and it has matic which is the other name for centella asiatica which has been a very popular ingredient now for several years it kind of became a hit from the asian beauty world and a lot of people have been saying how great it is for inflammation anti-irritation calming and soothing the skin and i had never tried a product with that ingredient before and to be honest if i had known it was in this i probably would have tried this sooner but i didn't know that so once i purchased it and i read over the ingredients again i noticed it had that so it was very curious so this product comes out very thick it's like a paste no scent no fragrance it's almost like a diaper cream you see how it doesn't rub in quickly like the other one like for example if i put the laroche tolerance here you'll see that this is going to disappear look no white residue whereas this is like feels more oily and thick but very nice if you like that feeling of a balm or a rich cream almost like kind of like that la mere texture um it does absorb well after a while so what i do is i use this as my all-over moisturizer and then i'll put a little dollop of this on my finger pads and i'll spread it out to kind of sheer it out and then i'll just gently pat it over the really dry area so this is more like a spot healing moisturizer for me so really been focusing it in this area and like the sides of my nose from blowing my nose allergies things like that that way i'm not rubbing because it's such a thick product if you put a lot of it on you might have to massage quite a bit which can be too stimulating for your skin so by pressing it on top it sort of seals everything and creates a barrier and the product slowly seeps in when i wake up in the morning there's no residue and no residue on my pillow or anything like that but my skin has been getting healthier and healthier and stronger and calmer and it took about a week and a half to do the damage of the dry flaky patches on my skin with that cleanser and it took about a week using this on top of this after double cleansing to heal that and get rid of all that flaky skin and have my skin back to normal so this is what i'm using at night this followed by this and then in the morning i'm doing this followed by a little bit of this again in that cheek area just because it's been so dry and then my sunblock and i've been loving this so it does have silicones in it again so if that's something you're avoiding i'm sorry i wish i had better news for you but if you aren't avoiding silicones for any specific reason and you are struggling with really dry skin or patches of dry irritated skin i would definitely recommend this and then if you don't like it it's safe enough for babies and children or you could use it on hands knees elbows things like that so i'm really liking the zika plus bone okay so this is a couple weeks later since filming that and i've been testing out a new moisturizer so i wanted to add this one to the list before the video goes out because i'm really liking it and it's one a lot of you have probably come across in your research it's the bioderma scentsy bio ar sensitive skin prone to rosacea anti-redness care so i got this um it was buy one get one fifty percent off at walgreens and um i was almost out of the la roche posay um tolarion so i wanted to try this i patch tested it for a couple weeks with no issues and then i started using it and i really like it um it's silicone free but it does have mineral oil so you know it really depends on if you're trying to avoid certain ingredients or not it also has ingredients that are supposedly calming for the skin like seaweed extracts and some other things it's not oil-free either but i find it to be actually more hydrating and moisturizing than the tolarian ultra by la roche posay so and i wanted to try something that had a little bit more ingredients for reducing redless i think it also has licorice in it um so yeah i'm really liking it scent free i think it absorbs well and it does leave my skin feeling like really soft and plump um at night a lot of the times i'm still putting the zika balm all on top on my cheeks because it's just been so dry lately but i do think this one is more moisturizing on its own than the tolarion so if you've tried that in the past and you didn't find it moisturizing enough or you want something that has a few more ingredients that might help combat your redness i would definitely say to give this a try it's 1.33 ounces so yeah and i just squeeze i'll show you the texture uh i just squeeze a cup of dots onto my face it's a nice cream no scent and yeah i really like the texture a lot it's just absorbs nicely it feels really good so i'm really really happy with that and um it might be one worth checking out especially when it's on sale and they know dermstore sells la roche-posay event and um bioderma so when they have sales it's a great time to stock up or try a couple of different uh products and then finally i've been using a new sunscreen for a couple of months that i have been loving i really wanted to use a non-waterproof sunscreen for my daily wear and typically what i've been using in that capacity is the neutrogena redness relieving spf 20 moisturizer i still really like that product it never irritated my skin i didn't get sunburned with it although it's not what i would wear if i was like going to the beach or on a hike the problem is the tint is too orangey and i feel like as it oxidizes not only over the course of the day but also as it gets older within the tub so what starts out you know when you have a full fresh bottle as a mildly orange dark tint gets oranger and orange as time goes by and it just really wasn't matching my skin like you would literally see a delineation mark or if i didn't rub it in well you'd see these patches and that just wasn't going to work so i'd been doing some research and exploring and i had considered several different options but i ended up with the skin medica essential defense mineral shield broad spectrum spf 32 sunscreen it is not waterproof and it is tinted and i am liking it very much i've been using it for about two months now it's made for post-procedure skin so it's you know the ingredients are for hypersensitive skin it does have silicones in it it also has caffeine in it which works for some people's skin with rosacea and others know but i've been liking it a lot so i'll show you what it's like the tint is a little dark but because it's more sheer than the new than the cetaphil it rubs in better and it is still a lighter tint than the cedar fill so it looks like that and it just rubs right in and what i like about this no smell um what i like about this is it's very moisturizing without feeling oily or greasy or heavy so like i've been saying i've been going through about a really dry skin and the weather has been extremely dry here so i'm all about the moisture right now and so doing my moisturization routine and then topping it off with this sunscreen one to two pumps has been really nice and i don't get oily throughout the day it doesn't feel heavy it's very easy to wash off at the end of the night yeah no reactions so i got this on derm store i would highly recommend it i love the pump application i think it's a really good product and i think it could work for a variety of skin types so if you're less dry than me you might not even need moisturizer or if you're living in a humid climate you might just be able to you know refresh your skin in the morning and go in with this as your sunblock and moisturizer which is nice because combo products are always great um because i feel like it's that moisturizing um but yeah it doesn't really leave you shiny at least i don't think so this is me after a day of work i've been wearing it all day no powder [Music] so again i have very dry skin but i don't feel like it makes me look oily at all um and that's kind of all i can say about that i i'm loving this i'll definitely repurchase it it's way more expensive than the cetaphil but the tint alone makes it much preferable for me especially since i don't wear foundation i need the color to match my skin or at least match better than the cetaphil was maybe when i get if i ever get more tan again that one will work but since i'm so good about staying out of the sun now because of my rosacea my skin has gotten more and more fair and i needed a better skin tone matching product so that's it for today i hope you enjoyed this video comment below with what moisturizers are really working for your skin or if you have any questions about products i mentioned or any other products you're looking at that seem interesting to you and i will see you again soon thanks so much for watching",

        "transcript": "hello to say it's been a hot minute is a drastic understatement but what I'm glad to report is that my skin is clear my rosacea people say it's incurable I don't care I never believed it I never wanted to believe it so I kept searching for me it's been since 2016 and it's now 2023. it's about time I would say and in this video I want to share with you uh the things that have really helped me have changed and revolutionized my skin I spent a long time believing that it was difficult to heal and that the more pain I put myself through the stretch of the regimen the more likely it was that I was doing the right thing and that I would get better that was never the case and I've had times where I feel like I've healed and then I've backtracked I got mold poisoning and everything came back even with a Vengeance I became you know having reactions to all types of food when I had made so much progress before and I just thought when is enough enough and it was actually last year in August when I got I was before August it was in June last year when I got covered and I got significantly worse again everything got re-triggered and activated and I was just fed up and you know in those moments where you go nut enough is enough what I'm doing is not working it has gotten me this far it's not getting me any further and you hit this like roadblock and it's so frustrating and you just want to cry and you're overwhelmed I hit that point back in June 2022 and I turned around and went I'm doing it differently so I met this friend through my blog in the raw and I had helped her with her rosacea journey and she came back around and swung back around and helped me with my rosacea Journey now her recommendation to me was to try particular products this is not a sponsored ad I have nothing to do with anything I would never do that um but I'm just going to share with you what worked because I think I owe it to you and I've I've recommended it to multiple different people and the results that they've had has just been amazing uh because it works and all of a sudden what I found in my health Journey was that it went from being super difficult to being very clear this is getting rid of the cause I don't have to like starve myself and worry about everything being just so otherwise I'm going to have this awful reaction which is what it was all of a sudden I'm getting better and better and I can eat I was so happy and it was such a relief because every day my skin is getting consistently better consistently better consistently better and it's just like for the first time it's not get a bit better get a little bit worse get a bit better get a little bit worse and just like this journey of just uncertainty and like is it this is it that enough you know we have to deal with enough things that we shouldn't be having to worry you know constantly about what we eat about changing our pillow every five minutes about worrying about touching our face and just all these like finicky things that we we obsess over when we have such severe issues we think oh if we do all these miniature things like then my skin will be okay as if it's your fault that your skin is not okay that you are doing something fundamentally wrong well sometimes it's about finding the root of how it occurred and allowing yourself to enjoy life and ease into the things that you want to ease into um so this is what these products did for me and oh I should probably show you what they are I didn't organize that very well this is a bit impromptu so the products that I started using were recommended by my friend who also had a severe formal rosacea very similar presentation to mine we have very different Journeys but very similar presentation and I was super skeptical at first I was I it actually she recommended to me nine months earlier and I kept thinking to myself I wish I tried this earlier uh but who cares it was perfect timing that's just the same it was perfect timing so I tie the products I but before I did I start going no like I just nosedive into all of this person's content he was originally a doctor dermatologist who got sick of the fact that the typical way that Dermatology functions the options are laser antibiotics or anti-inflammatories all of which can cause a lot of damage and for many of you I know because I speak to so many people around the world their rosacea got significantly worse after taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatories because it exacerbates the underlying cause now controversial thing to say but I'm going to say it so he started questioning that and started formulating uh and researching to what might work and rosacea is such a complex skin condition it seems to be one of the most difficult skin conditions and the one that doctors seem to believe cannot be eradicated cannot be reversed but I have reversed the vast majority of my allergies before I get to the solution I just want to share with you something so exciting for the past three weeks I have been eating gluten I've been eating all these things that I normally would be like I'm never eating that again it's so bad for you um and just enjoying food and just loving life um so uh and I still listen to my body anyway the point is let's get to the product so I started using and researching and deep diving into a product called as osmosis or a brand called osmosis I began with their rescue serum uh which helped with my dry painful red and flaky skin it was so painful and so red I'll show you before and afters um I mean you can see the after but the befores of when I start before I started using these products it's just crazy like the inflammation not just the redness and the bumps I had like a nose bump like this but also the puffiness of my eyes the swelling of my cheeks like I also had like a double chin um even though I'm the same size so I was just overall really inflamed and swollen and that's because it's autoimmune issues now I thought on the rescue and immediately I felt insane relief like previously I had been putting on so much Derma vigils like just slapping on the lipids just to try and almost like a Vaseline just like trying to cover my um my barrier so that it would not be leaking moisture all the time because it was so itchy and so sore I was applying it multiple times a day I couldn't go anywhere without it I would never ever dream of you know not cleansing my face or going through my routine if I woke up I immediately had to go to the bathroom and wash my face because I was in agony always when I wake up when I go to bed now sometimes I forget to wash my face I actually don't know who I am anymore I'm pretty good though like it's it's not a regular occurrence but that's the level I don't it it's not like an everyday Obsession because it's not painful it's it's livable I mean it's pretty good so okay rescue fantastic product it's a DNA Repair Serum it helps to heal scars does all these things for collagen look it up um I'll probably put some links below uh so that you can have a little bit of a look-see but Dr Ben Johnson has so much so many YouTube videos online I'll tell you all the other things that I also used as well so I started with rescue and I also started with regenerate which was a liver it's meant to help regenerate the liver and help the liver so Dr Ben's theory is that with rosacea it's either liver induced or it's candida introduced and he has things on the website to determine what that is you can also email him uh and I'll put his email down below you can email him personally and he will respond to you um for free so that's really generous um it's getting harder and harder for him to do it within you know a week or so but it's worth it regenerate he told me I needed to go on it for nine months I hit the nine month Mark I think a month ago um and now I'm off all the internal products and my skin stays consistently really good it's improving all the time every month and so regenerate was the second one I also after I started doing the regenerate I was making a lot of progress but I wasn't making it's like I was making progress in some areas of my skin and not in other areas and when I sent some photos to Dr Ben he said you also have candida rosacea so I went on his candida protocol as well as the liver protocol and I started as I was detoxing my skin that's why I started with the rescue because it helps detox as well detox and heal after I started with the rescue I started adding other elements into my regimen but if it was causing the detox to happen too strongly I would pair back and wait I think it took me three months before I could go on some of these other repair serums I went on stem factor which helps with like collagen and scarring and then I also wanted to try Catalyst Ace 11. once you start learning about all these incredible products and what they do for your skin it's like I want to try I want to try but you have to slow down and so I now have implemented I've got stem Factor rescue the um correct serum I started off with calm which is better for rosacea skin you start off with calm and then uh Catalyst ac11 every now and again um and that's really good for elasticity and it's just all of it helps with different things for the skin especially when you're doing repair like I've had almost what seven years of skin damage and breakage to make up for so my skin is loving it the first thing I realized when I put this topical stuff on my skin was oh it's fading my skin my my skin feels fed uh so that was really great and then um yeah so you can look up what his candida protocol is it's um something called uh you take these capsules called clarify it helps you clear out mucus which apparently is what candida different types of candida feeds off and then you take this like spray Elixir thing which helps reduce the population of the candida so I did that for three months and noticed significant effects and then I just continued to improve as I continue to take regenerate and I also took his fat supplement which I forget the name of at this point in time uh that one's really amazing as well I took that for three months because I in the past had really bad I just I just didn't have enough natural oils and lipids in my skin um that's also something that could help aid your skin as well as not having enough oils because I wasn't absorbing it because my liver wasn't functioning properly so I wasn't absorbing fat and I've noticed like I used to have a lot of pulling like my skin was pulling and tight because it didn't have enough lipids and fats and I've done you know a lot of skin scans now and the pulling is no longer there so my skin is now like having this vibrant lipid look the youthful look or whatever I know I'm younger whatever I did have like all these what appeared to be like all these Fine Lines because my skin was so dry I would highly recommend giving it a go emailing Dr Ben again this isn't sponsored but I just wanted to give you guys an update because I want more people to know about what works and at the end of the day it's all about having a better relationship with your body learning to love yourself more and living the most vibrant life you can so you can start giving to others one of the things that I struggle with the most and I think we do struggle with in self-esteem when your skin severely affects your life especially with more severe skin conditions or ones that are autoimmune related they really significantly can impact your life and it impacts your ability to contribute to the world to actualize yourself to Greater to Greater degrees it might affect travel it might affect the activities you participate in it may affect the you know the confidence level of you to be able to make contacts and friends and further yourself and your career it might reduce your ability to earn and therefore give back to society maybe you want to make more contributions to Charities causes all these things like it affects every area of your life and people don't realize the significant impact and so that's why I'm sharing this with you because I feel like the past nine months of my life 10 months I think it's 10 or 11 months now I can't even count anymore I've just lost track have been transformed because of this so let me know how you go let me know your thoughts let me know if you've tried it before and yeah I would love to see how it helps you and if you tried it as a result of watching this video anyway lots of love to you and um good luck on your skin Journey",

        "transcript": "let me guys get excited because this video is a long time coming I feel like it's been over a year since I did a tips for rosacea today's video I'm going to share with you guys dermatologist tips for navigating skincare choosing skincare and thanks to avoid and skincare products for people with rosacea one of my favorite skincare products for people with rosacea you guys know is Rosa care and I'm partnering with procure the maker of Rosa care on today's video so I'll talk a little bit more later in today's video on why this is a fantastic product for people with rosacea in their skincare routine if you have rosacea you already know what a challenge it can be to navigate the skincare aisle and select skincare products that do not irritate you staying burn cause excessive redness and irritation on your skin rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by hypersensitivity to things that come in contact with the skin and that hypersensitivity manifests with symptoms such as burning tingling flushes of redness heat and little red bumps that almost look like acne and pimples but are a little different in their underlying nature rosacea is an incredibly uncomfortable disease to live with so my number one tip for rosacea skin care and navigating rosacea skin care products is keep it simple keep it simple in that your routine and the products you use should not be excessive there should not be more than three products think about it rosacea is a skin disease in which things that come in contact with the skin are very likely to irritate you so reduce the number of things that you put on your skin that is my number one tip basic tenets of a skincare routine really for anybody but in particular for people with rosacea should just be three products a gentle cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen and I'll get into the details and nuances of those in a moment so that leads me into my next tip and that is cleansing your skin it is important to cleanse your skin and to select a gentle cleanser a non soap cleanser I have several videos talking about some of my favorite gentle cleansers for the face so I'll list those videos down below for you to check out things that come in contact with the skin from your environment so on the skin and can contribute to you prolonged symptoms and exacerbation of redness and irritation the way you cleanse your skin out is very important you need to do so in a gentle manner just use lukewarm water want to avoid extremes of temperature and just use your finger pads in a circular motion across the face cleansing your skin this way is important for everybody but in particular for people with rosacea because physical physical touch physical factors can also flare redness irritation and precipitate flares of your disease in other words things like spin brushes scrub brushes facial brush those harsh washcloths can be your nemesis so just use your finger pads in a gentle circular motion and then rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water my third tip is to use a moisturizer on a daily basis whether your skin is dry or oily you still really need to moisturize moisturizers hydrate the skin by trapping water onto the surface of the skin and sealing it there in place they also condition the skin cells smooth the skin cells and calm down inflammation for people with rosacea using a moisturizer is really important also because we know that in individuals who use a moisturizer along with their rosacea medications they have a better outcome to their treatment than if they don't use a moisturizer and the reason using a moisturizer is so important is that it helps just you the skin hydrate the skin reduce the likelihood of irritation and the way to apply it is to use it immediately after cleansing to damp skin so once you rinse off your cleanser in the face is still wet that is when you want to apply your moisturizer and the reason for this is that it capitalizes on the hydration status of your skin at the time of cleansing just as you wet the skin to remove that cleanser there's a lot of water on your skin so moisturizer with its ingredients will come on and we'll lock that water in place and really helped you drive hydration into your skin and see the skin and reduce irritations and doing so will reduce the severity of rosacea and we have several studies showing can improve your treatment outcomes with your prescription topical and oral medicaid rosacea medications it's a really important part of rosacea skin care now my fourth tip will come as no surprise to you all because I talked about it and any chance I get I will bring it up and that is to protect your skin from the Sun wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen rosacea patients have a challenge however in finding a sunscreen that will protect their skin without simultaneously irritating the rosacea so some tips for selecting a sunscreen are to select a physical sunscreen and what that means is that when you look at the active ingredients of the sunscreen it should say zinc oxide only or it should say zinc and titanium dioxide those should be the active ingredients these active ingredients are most well tolerated or people with rosacea they are not irritating they do not sting they do not burn on the other hand other ingredients in sunscreens that are chemical ingredients chemical filters things like oxybenzone Ava Ben's own chakra line these ingredients can really be irritating for people with rosacea these ingredients can cause a little bit of irritation to this these types and precipitate a flare so it's best to select a mineral only physical sunscreen and by that again I mean one whose active ingredient is either zinc only or the active ingredients zinc plus titanium dioxide those are most well tolerated and the sunscreen also should be labeled broad-spectrum and it should be an SPF a sun protective factor of 30 or higher in order to properly protect your skin sunscreen needs to be applied on a daily basis even when it's cloudy out this is because the ultraviolet radiation that comes from the Sun can come through the clouds it can come through your windows and can contribute to the inflammation in your skin and drive your rosacea so you need to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen on a daily basis some other tips the over choosing your sunscreen is make sure it does it's fragrance free fragrance as I'll get into later is a it can really be problematic for people with rosacea to make sure it's fragrance free look for ingredients like silicones silicones go by the name dimethicone and a few other names all lists down below for you guys to help navigate but silicones are well tolerated in moisturizers and sunscreens for people with rosacea there they tend to be lightweight they are oil-free and therefore are comfortable for people with rosacea hyaluronic acid is a humectant that will frequently be included not only in moisturizers but also in sunscreens and is also well tolerated in people with rosacea helps to hydrate the skin and in a sunscreen can really helped you combat some of the dryness that you might experience with using a mineral sunscreen they can be a little drying so those are some good ingredients to look for and some good features to look for in choosing a sunscreen check out my videos on my protection mineral sunscreens I reviewed several and again I'll list the video that I'm talking about it down below in the description box to make it easy for you guys so my this set of tips pertains to ingredients what to look for what to exclude the number one thing that you should excluding from your skincare products is fragrance I always encourage everybody to make every effort to exclude fragrance from their products to only select fragrance free products but in particular people with rosacea have to do this and the reason is twofold people with rosacea have a higher likelihood of developing something called allergic contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis happens when you become sensitized against an ingredient and then you develop a skin allergy every time you come in contact with it so they have a higher likelihood of developing an allergy to fragrance in their products and people with rosacea are also more likely to have flares of their symptoms regardless of allergy when they come in contact with fragrance why is that so well the reason is because fragrance compounds can function not only as irritants on the skin and drive inflammation but they're also things called vasodilators vasodilators make the blood vessels in her skin to dilate and bring more redness into the skin which is the opposite of what you want to do in rosacea so selecting products that are fragrance free is really important selecting a product oh it's fragrance free it's tricky to navigate because you might be duped into thinking that a product labelled unscented is safe unscented is not fragrance free when you read unscented be very careful because unscented often means the product contains fragrance and it contains a masking fragrance to hide the scent of the product so that you don't detect it with your nose but it's still there and fragrance goes by a lot of names so I will list these names down below in the description box for you guys so you know what to look for because manufacturers are not really required to disclose the inclusion of fragrance in their products I'll list those names down below for you guys so you know what or in addition to fragrance the other ingredient that you want to avoid it's kind of very similar to pregnancy is any type of essential oils lavender oil rose oil rubs hip oil any type of essential oil regardless of how it was processed and made can contain things like fragrance ingredients that while you may not detect them with your nose while they may not have an aroma to them they can still irritate and bother the skin of rosacea so avoiding products with essential oils is really important the other ingredient to avoid is the inclusion of alcohols in your skin hair products alcohols are frequently present in a lot of sunscreen will often have alcohol so you've got to look for that ingredient alcohol is also added to stabilize active ingredients in sunscreens so it's in a lot of sunscreens and for people in general you know alcohol and alcohol Danitra they're not it's not a bad ingredient it's not something to fear but for people with rosacea it definitely is something that can contribute to a flare of their disease and irritate their skin simply because it is more on the drying side and people with rosacea just don't tolerate that to the same degree as other skin types and other people with without rosacea so avoid avoid alcohol and then menthol menthol is something that has to be avoided you'll find men fell on a lot of face washes and it imparts a tingling sensation you don't want a tingles and rosacea and some other ingredients in that vein that are often out it includes things like peppermint as well which is added to make things tingle and then witch hazel I have videos talking about witch hazel and you know it can be irritating and it really can be irritating for people with rosacea the other ingredient to avoid is eucalyptus eucalyptus is frequently added as a preservative to products and but it has been reported as something that is really aggravating to people with rosacea there are some beneficial botanic ingredient so in rosacea and for rosacea care one of which includes niacinamide niacinamide is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for redness it can it can reduce the amount of redness and it also can help your skin barrier in healing and keep your skin hydrated so it is a good ingredient ceramides are also a good ingredient to consider or rosacea they are natural part of our natural lipid barrier and in moisturizers can help our skin barrier and then also licorice root extract is very helpful in rosacea skin care products because it like niacinamide can be calming out anti redness you will find licorice root in a variety of products that are labeled anti redness and kind of targeting people with rosacea so that is a good ingredient from a cosmetic perspective another ingredient to look for property in a product you look for is chromium or color correction with a green tint this helps to camouflage redness and even out skin tone very nicely the reason I like this product is they is specifically formulated for people with rosacea and they they have not included any of the common rosacea irritants there's no menthol there's no eucalyptus there's no fragrance so all the stuff I told you to avoid is not in this this contains good ingredients for rosacea including niacinamide which as I said is anti-inflammatory helpful for the skin barrier it also includes licorice root which is anti redness and thirdly it contains the color correcting chromium property so it can nicely helped you even out skin tone without masking things so it's not like a makeup or a cosmetic it simply helps to even out skin tone through that chromium these ingredients are evidence-based for rosacea so the formulation combines the wisdom of nature with the power of science to really deliver an effect product for our rosacea sufferers that takes the guesswork out of ingredients and navigating ingredient lists and in addition to those beneficial rosacea ingredients that I mentioned niacinamide licorice root extract and color correct and chromium this also is a nice rosacea friendly moisturizer in that it's got hyaluronic acid which is hydrating helps to hold on water into the skin as a humectant and has dimethicone and silicone ingredients which helped you seal in water into the skin and trap water there and prevent what's called trans epidermal water loss from the skin that could lead to dryness so this is a really nice lightweight and comfortable moisturizer to wear for people with rosacea or really honestly if you have redness in general it's also very good this product is oil-free it's not going to exacerbate and the acne clog pores it's non-comedogenic and I'm really comfortable to wear the way to use this is as a moisturizer to apply it immediately active cleansing your face to damp skin and allow it to dry you can apply it in the evening time after cleansing and then again in the morning after cleansing after after cleansing and applying this allow it to dry and then put your sunscreen on over for morning use I can buy it on amazon.com as well at CVS anyways guys that concludes the tips check the description box I will list the key features that I mentioned in today's video I hope it was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

        "transcript": "look at this it's amazing it's like liquid gold it is what's up everyone we're back dr maxfield dr shaw and welcome back to our channel dr lee where we talk about all things skincare and dermatology so it's that time of the year when we wrap up our favorite skincare products of the year so best moisturizers of the year that's what we're going to start off with so this is great because i think moisturizers almost are like the backbone of skin care sometimes i don't know it just seems to do so much of the heavy okay actives do the heavy lifting but look but they're so important one of my favorite things to talk about yeah i'm obsessed with moisturizers as many of you know you know big fan of the double moisturizing but i noticed when i was trying to put together this list that there are so many favorite moisturizers that i have and the best way to do this i think is to do it based on category we're going to go over the best moisturizers for very dry skin we're going to go over the best lightweight moisturizers we're going to go over the best moisturizers with retinol best of the year here we go here we go [Music] so let's talk about very dry skin first i like a thick moisturizer so you can even use these if you don't have very dry skin but you just like a thicker moisturizer so what's your sort of favorite of the year okay my favorite is absolutely this right here la roche posay lipocar bomb ap plus it is i have one upstairs in my dresser i have one by my front door i have one one in my drawer in my office and one on my other driver mouth is like my go-to yeah so this is actually a great option so it has a lot of beneficial ingredients in it so i really personally like this one for my body but i think you use it on both your body and your face right so only when i'm in the winter and like just the wind uh what do you call it wind chap wind when burns burn really starts to get me then i move it up to my face as well so it's got shea butter that has that la roche posay prebiotic thermal water in it um it's fragrance free um it's been tested for comedogenicity which you know hit or miss um plus dr maxwell's favorite ingredient niacinamide yeah and the like the thing that i think makes this nice is it's a heavier uh moisturizer my arm is going to be super greasy by the end of this video but it's a heavier moisturizer um but it's not like the heaviest moisturizer so if you get with like a vana cream that one has a bit higher petroleum concentration so for me this is like heavy thick thick has dark shocks safe but then it also has like a medium blend and i think most people are going to tolerate this really well so this is definitely something worth if you have dry skin or if you have dry skin on the body i use this on my ankles because my ankles are always dry so big fan of this one shout out to laroche posse accepted by the national eczema association all right so for very dry skin this one is more for the face for me skin fix triple lipid peptide cream huge fan of this one i think when it comes to moisturizers you really have to try it you can look at the ingredient list all day with some of these products you have no idea if you're going to like it on your skin unless you try them so i have a normal combination skin but i still use this one just a very very good moisturizer with this peptide lipid complex anyone who's tried it really does love it um it's fragrance free doesn't cause a lot of allergy or irritation in anybody and i've just been using it for a really long time and this is the this is the moisturizer i like send to friends and families who are like getting into skincare i like order from the website and i just like ship it to them because i know a lot of people like it and the thing i like about moisturizers too it's pop-off yeah i knew that so the thing we like no it's not it's like a no you just open the holes i don't think okay i just don't want to break things i'm so strong i just break things all the time so you're not supposed to put your finger in this okay so so the thing i like about moisturizers now uh i think they're just becoming almost like a hybrid you just have this has peptides in it among other things your moisturizer is doing work it's not just moisturizing it's also adding to your actives along the way and this is just an example of one of those all right so next up let's talk about some of our favorite lightweight moisturizers now these are going to be good for like oily skin normal skin but maybe just somebody who likes more of that lightweight uh texture some people don't like to feel like their skin is being suffocated by their moisturizer and i totally get that you don't need like thick moisturizers like i do i think stand out in this category has always been the cerave pm lotion yeah this has been one of my favorites it's kind of like just that old school go-to i think in my mind like first thing comes to mind lightweight moisturizer and then like does it have niacinamide of course happens to have nice and mitotis too it is just the cerave pm great for facial skin good for sensitive skin it's just very all-around excellent lightweight moisturizer and remember that niacinamide regulates oil production and so for somebody who does have oilier skin look for more stretches that have niacinamide in it now it's not necessary like when i say that a lot of people think it decreases oil production so if you have dry skin it's not like you can't use niacinamide you have oily skin it will normalize it but if you have dry skin it's not going to dry you out so dr maxfield is applying the crb pm moisturizer while i talk about the biosol's squalene probiotic gel moisturizer okay so as you can tell i have a lot of skin care products for me to get this close to empty we're using this quite a bit why do i like this one well it's a lightweight super gel consistency so this thing is like very gel consistency like but that squalling that it has in it that it leaves behind leaves me with the glow so this is always my last step in my skincare routine before i shoot video let me tell you something okay i did a video with wired and go check it out i don't know if we can link it but check it out hi i'm dr maniv shah and this is skin support how safe for tanning booths i used to go tanning all the time at young forehead great username should you or shouldn't you pop your pimples all right let's settle this debate i am very much against popping your pimples i got to the studio and the people there were like hey do you want us to like powder you to like get rid of the uh shine and i was like no i do skincare like we never wear like makeup when we should do skincare videos and they're like no no like you're we're studio lights right now like it's gonna be you're gonna shine and i was like no no i'm good i do video i'm fine i was wrong i literally am like reflecting light off of the screen so um that's probably because of this squalling probiotic gel moisturizer could have been that but ultimately i should have listened you know what's great about that though is when i was watching his wired because i actually do watch some of some of his things not all of his things but some of them and i actually thought it was like man dr shaw looks so dewy he must be loving this right now i was hoping that people from our channel would go to the video and comment that dr shaw had achieved his ultimate goal of being dewey a couple people did comment dewey because they knew what was going on but i was doing but maybe a little too dewy for your average wired viewer so next up we're going to be talking about best moisturizer of the year in the acne category so this one's pretty simple and it really it was the standout so much so that we dedicated half a video to it and this was and i drove to target 45 minutes away for it but this is the cetaphil gentle clear mattifying acne moisturizer right so of course the salicylic acid is really doing that heavy lifting for the acne and that mattifying component makes it really good for oily skin yeah and for people with oily skin that's actually pretty important to them i think they spend a lot of time battling their oil control and the glossiness of their skin dewy skin is something they want less of but this lotion also has ingredients that are going to help with the hyperpigmentation that comes on after the inflammation of acne calms down it has coach acid and licorice so really unlike a lot of salicylic acid products this gave a little bit more boost and i think actually the texture is something that won me over i think that for someone with oily acne skin this is really going to be a very comfortable lotion with great ingredients right and i don't think a lot of people are doing the mattifying things so i think it's great that cetaphil has that line for people that don't like to have that dewy experience that i like to have um the other thing is that a lot of people with acne don't want to moisturize because they think it's going to make it worse and so having a moisturizer that's also an acne treatment is really going to encourage people to moisturize which is good because if you don't moisturize and you have acne it's going to make the inflammation worse all right so next up moisturizers that have retinol in them so you can always use your retinol serum or retinol cream or whatever you have and put your favorite moisturizer over it not going to discourage you from doing that but for somebody who really wants a simplified skincare routine and does want to skip that moisturizing step we figured because we love retinol so much we should include moisturizers that have retinol in them as a separate category one of the sort of og's in this category is the neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair regenerating cream it has a fragrance free and a fragranced version so go with the fragrance free version it still has the same actives in it i see no reason to use a fragrance product when there's the fragrance free option out there personally so now you had some issues with this one well okay it's not like issues okay you know what just very candidly i think there's an expectations issue so i got this i got this probably when i was 20 years old that was a long time ago right and it was first time ever bought a retinol and i think i you know saw reduces wrinkles gets rid of pores whatever was being promoted at the time not even necessarily by them and i bought it with the expectation that that was going to happen and it didn't at least not immediately so um i think that was actually where a lot of my initial frustration came from and actually i'm glad they brought this over so actually very few negative if any negative things to say now about it it actually is very tremendous in the space right so this is going to be something that has been time tested grab the fragrance free one and it can be just cleanse at night and apply this and you'd be done next up in this category that deserves mention is the retinal correction max daily hydration cream from rock i gotta highlight rock because rock we talk about retinol all the time on this channel and we know the tretinoin when it was first invented and discovered that was pioneered by albert kligman at upenn that showed that it had all these benefits in anti-aging and act it didn't become commercialized and available to the public as retinol without prescription until many years later and the company that pioneered that was actually rock so it's kind of associated with more like old-timey type of skin care old-timey but effective and i think that's actually a very strong testament to the brand if you can maintain a certain status quo for what decades there are so many good moisturizers retinols coming out like even the olay or generous one just solid right but to have something like this they pioneered so much of it so props to them and a great great product so similar to the neutrogena one this actually does come in a fragrance free and a fragrance version again i would still opt fragrance free version for this it's actually a new product believe it or not because i think they actually had other retinol products before this and i think they had the fragrance run before this but this one came out maybe came out this year i really like this one a lot it moisturizes and it also has a very effective stabilized form of retinol that rock uses and they actually put a lot of research into it this is a company that spends a lot of time doing research on their products but they go through like years of trials for them yeah that can't the value of that can't be understated putting in the legwork there it just carries the whole it carries the whole industry when the one company puts the research in everyone piggybacks off of that and i will say that retinols in moisturizers they're very they have a very high utility in my mind for people with sensitive skin who are wanting to start a retinol because they may not experience the irritation that you might get with a high strength prescription tretinoin or something like that off the bat and so it's a nice way to ease into the retinoid world and just also moisturize your face at the same time you're new to retinol it may be nice to kind of ease in with a retinal moisturizer so we're going to be talking about how to simplify your skin care routine with a retinal moisturizer well what could you potentially do during the day or you could find a moisturizer that has spf sunscreen in it so caveat here is if you are going to use your moisturizer as a sunscreen you need to use as much as you'd use of your sunscreen so according to my calculations uh you need to use two finger lengths of sunscreen for the face neck and ears same applies if you're going to use a moisturizer the reason why is because when they do the studies on these they do it under the same sunscreen conditions and so maybe you would normally apply a little bit less moisturizer maybe apply the same amount but just keep that in mind that applies to makeup also so if you're using a makeup that has an spf in it you need to use as much makeup as you would have used of sunscreen that sounds crazy and practical for makeup wow i never thought about that now again i think the utility is high for moisturizers and spf because it's just like very natural for people to reapply moisturizers throughout the day in fact i think it's just easier to carry that one product with you throughout the day and reapply that and not have to think twice about two different things so what is our first pick so this one came out this year actually this is the cetaphil healthy radiance whipped day cream broad spectrum f30 so broad spectrum spf 30 plus it has two percent niacinamide in it so it could actually triple as your niacinamide treatment plus um it's a moisturizer and so it has a lot of moisturizing ingredients plus it's fragrance free so this is another really good option you could just cleanse throw this on the morning bolt at the door still be late like i am okay and then there's another side to this too so that one is amazing only comes in non-tinted so the upside of this one here this is by dermatology the universal tinted moisturizer spf 46. this is tinted so it gives you the added coverage against visible light but unlike some of the other tinted moisturizers this blends in pretty well which many do but it doesn't pill as much as some of the other ones now my wife has been using this actually has her foundation but i know some other people like abby young use spfs as foundation dupes as well for like four maybe six months now consistently and it's just worked great so i can speak to that side of it where i might not otherwise super lightweight it's not that greasy sometimes i think spf moisturizers can feel really greasy this is not as greasy as a lot of them and i think in an honorable mention in this category would be the alpha md uv clear which i in my opinion think is pretty moisturizing personally it's not marketed as a moisturizer sunscreen but is moisturizing enough for me to just use it as a single step in the morning yeah ltmd's their whole line i think fits that role almost like uv restores my go-to the same thing as my facial moisturizer you want will restore smacks that is so good definitely i think if you are a big fan of alta md and you've tried the uv clear in the past try the uv restore it is amazing all right if you don't have any of these skin issues then what about just a normal moisturizer for you know daily use so okay one of the ones that we have talked about before it's actually similar there are so many great great moisturizers and we've talked about so many over the course of the year we always talk about cerebri products talk about first aid beauty ultra repair cream before this one is first aid beauty but a different cream yeah so this is their collagen repair cream ultra repair firming collagen cream okay so one of my issues well i don't really have an issue with it but you know part of the marketing of course is that you know the word collagen so you think collagen i have collagen in my skin i want collagen on my skin that's going to get in my skin collagen is way too large of a particle you know it's a combination of amino acids long chains so it's really just not going to penetrate the skin that being said it's actually a great moisturizer collagen so this is actually just overall a really good moisturizer to have that um collagen in it i thought i love that so i'm actually thrilled that he took a little dig there in it because that this is like a very very big pet peeve of mine too is just i guess collagen i think it's a trigger word for me i'm learning about myself today on this video but regardless of that does make great moisturizer which just doubles down on the effectiveness of this moisturizer it's just wonderful effective and just good all-around for just everyday skin right and it is a little bit on the heavier side it's not like a gel it's truly a cream one of them i used quite a bit honestly and got a lot of use out of almost out of it but what i will say about it is i like the way it feels on the skin in addition that has a lot of beneficial ingredients it has you know your standard moisturizing ingredients like glycerin dimethicone things like that but other ingredients like niacinamide panthenol shea butter and even ceramide yeah and then it also has colloidal oats which for me is one of those standout plant based ingredients it's been studied in eczema we know it makes a great moisturizer has some cleansing properties which you're not utilizing here but i love seeing that in products vino also has that incorporated into a lot of their products as well i really just like it it doesn't cause any issues with my skin it's fragrance free it's safe for sensitive skin i'm a big fan of first aid beauty in general i really like a lot of their products and this is one that really stood out to me but at the same time it doesn't really get a lot of height yeah it doesn't but that's okay we're bringing attention to it now great loaded moisturizer exactly so looking for a new moisturizer just normal skin that's safe for sensitive skin i would check out the ultra repair firming collagen cream another moisturizer in this category that also doesn't get a lot of hype is la roche posay tularian double repair face moisturizer now we talked about the tellurian ultra which is more of a lightweight lotion which maybe should have been included in our lightweight moisturizer category for safer sensitive skin but their double repair face moisturizer has ceramide and niacinamide in it is really in that in between category between lightweight and heavy and it's really just going to fit for most skin types if you're looking for a moisturizer don't know which one to grab the roche per se on double repair moisturizer is one i like a lot yeah and this is dry mentioned like it could have fit maybe into that lightweight moisturizer category there's so there are so many great moisturizers now and like the vana cream also would have been an addition like it deserves an honorable mention for that lightweight category actually this is this is this really is almost like a go-to for people i think coming out of dermatology offices it's like not using a facial moisturizer this is the perfect place to start so even for normal facial skin vana cream failure facial moisturizer is kind of a go-to and gets a little bit of an honorable mention here so the last moisturizer which i don't have on hand because we're at your place um but is the kiehl's ultra facial cream which is like an all-time favorite of mine but it's also like a cult classic so people that haven't tried keels like once you've tried some of the kiehl's products a lot of people like go crazy over them this is what i live with every day i lather this up with keels in the shower i don't like everything that they have because some of their products do have like some fragrances in them that are like not my favorite but they do have some products that are just like absolute hero products in their category and the ultra facial cream is one of them so it has a lot of beneficial ingredients like your glycerin your squalling and on top of that it has hydroxyl puminol swinging which is a pro an ingredient that no one really talks about but it's a ceramide that increases your own body's production of ceramide and so it's going to really reinforce the skin barrier but it's just because i've tried so many moisturizers i it's like one of those ones that you try and you just love it yeah amazing amazing moisturizer and i think that ties together our favorite list of moisturizers for the year they're not necessarily all new but they are some of our favorites that we have just grown to love and appreciate over the course of the calendar year and this is probably like the biggest category that we have of things because there's so many moisturizers that we both love and so uh sorry if this was like overwhelming but you know i would say you only need probably one moisturizer so yeah there's one of these you don't need to buy all of these but we try all these products um and this is just like maybe 10 products of the like 250 that we've tried this year and so these are just really great products yeah they are and once again dr shaw's light died so that cues us that it is time to go all right we'll see you in the next video please like comment and subscribe we appreciate you always [Music] is that too close to you like an awkward sequel it's too close what is going on [Music] okay perfect let me get you reset here",

        "transcript": "April is rosacea awareness a month and for those of you who know me in the channel you know that I've posted a lot about my struggles with rosacea some of the products that I've used to help overcome it and I say overcome it kind of loosely um I've come to terms with it I recognize what my triggers are I understand better how to maintain My Skin Barrier and most importantly focus on the treatments and medications that give me the best outcome for my skin I will say rosacea is definitely a marathon and not a Sprint as is most things with skin care there's rarely an overnight success or magic treatment that's gonna solve all your skin issues no matter what they are but certainly that's the case with rosacea at least that's been my experience while I have my rosacea pretty much under control I still have flare-ups I still have irritation I still kind of regress backwards so I just wanted to kind of sit back relax and do a little bit of an update video for you on how my rosacea my skin is doing now and what I attribute My Success to my skin in at its lowest point look like this but you can see now I specifically for today's video I'm not wearing any foundation BB cream CC cream I chose a tinted mineral sunscreen it's really new to me it was sent to me in PR it's naked Sunday's tinted mineral sunscreen I like the tinted mineral sunscreens of course because they offset the white cast overall my skin is just so much better than it was not to say that I don't still have flare-ups I do especially when I ignore my triggers which I know full well what they are red wine which sucks because I love red wine spicy foods also sucks I love spicy foods and my husband likes to cook spicy foods so yeah sometimes I have to suffer through the aftermath with my skin and the sun it's very hard to avoid the Sun but I do my best to mitigate that so I will wear a hat when I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time and I always always wear a daily sunscreen my view on sunscreen is honestly just find one you love and you use that speaking of setbacks recently I was traveling staying in a hotel room you know the air is different in the hotel room I was drinking red wine with dinner the climate was slightly different you can see on my face here how my rosacea flares and it's almost immediately so as much as I try to control my triggers and set the situation to be optimal for Success it still happens I'll tell you what I did in my story and hopefully you can just extrapolate from that something that may be useful for you of course you should be in consultation with a medical professional I'm not that I'm simply here to share with you my story and my experience so that hopefully it can arm you with some more information and help you along the way if nothing else to know you're not alone the Hallmarks on my rosacea is an impaired barrier Associated redness and flushing irritation inflammation and pimples back when it was at its worst this is what I did I stopped everything in my skincare routine basically put myself on a skincare diet I I went back to the very basics of cleansing and moisturizing my skin and when it comes to Cleansing just choose a cleanser that's very gentle and hydrating that's what worked for me I've used this Cetaphil Vana cream was one of my favorites uh this one by avino continues to be one of my favorites it's their common restore line and I wanted to call out this one this is the glucoside foaming cleanser and while this is a new launch from the ordinary I've been really enjoying this product for my skin my children have been using it too and they also have very sensitive skin it was tested on babies originally and it's just been a really lovely cleanser so back then when I was at my worst I wish I would have had something like this too I've also used cerave's hydrating cleanser it's really just about finding the one that works best for you within your price point I only cleanse my skin at night with a cleanser in the morning I use water only this is one of the ways I was able to keep my barrier intact the cleansing process just seemed to be too much for my skin if I was doing it morning and night so that was really a game changer for me for moisturizers I like to offer something that's rich in ceramides and that is a little bit occlusive to lock that moisture into the skin because one of the Hallmarks of rosacea is a damaged Skin Barrier it has trouble holding and retaining that moisture into the skin so if you can do that with your moisturizer you're ahead of the game so cerave's moisturizing lotion is a great one love regimen Labs cream this is their second iteration of this particular product they've actually improved the consistency and the applicability of this on the skin it's far less thick and more spreadable I'd say on the skin and this one's fabulous because it has ceramides as does the CeraVe one it's a higher price point for this but I just really love this brand for a gel type moisturizer going back to Aveeno this common restore line has just been really good for my skin I love this it's drugstore so it's readily accessible and great for my combination skin sometimes I don't want a thick Rich moisturizer this can be great in the morning and a thicker richer cream in the evening is sometimes what I opt for but another new launch from the ordinary they've improved or added to their natural moisturizing factors line and this one is their natural moisturizing factors plus phytoceramides so again just adding more ceramides into the formulation making this a really good moisturizer for rosacea in my opinion and also for those of you with dry skin when it comes to daily sunscreen my opinion just find one that works for you whether it's chemical mineral hybrid whatever it is tinted non-tinted cheap expensive if you're gonna put it on your face every day go with that one I'm being facetious because sometimes sunscreen can be irritating to some and you want to find the one that best suits your skin I've actually created a shop my which really lists the products that are my favorites by category those are affiliate links so you don't have to purchase through through those just look at what the products are and then you can Google and purchase on your own because otherwise I make a very small commission if you purchase from those links so if you want to great and thank you if you don't totally fine as well but the point is to be able to share with you what my favorites are by genre so I'll link my favorites below for my sunscreen category so you can take a look through there ask me specific questions in the comments if you have about any particular product all of the ones that are listed there are ones that have worked for my skin so I hope you find that helpful I did want to call it this product that came to me in PR this is by Dr jard it's your secret pair tiger grass Camp drops they're really neat and it's green looks kind of gross but if you know the color wheel green offsets or neutralizes red now this is an SPF 35 but I actually use this kind of more like makeup and then it's just giving me that additional sun protection so I apply whatever sunscreen I'm wearing wearing for the day and then I put a few drops of this over top and it really neutralizes the red so I'm kind of almost using it like makeup as opposed to sunscreen but definitely impressed with this product for me Beyond getting a basic skincare routine in place and focusing on restoring and repairing My Skin Barrier without adding in any active ingredients like retinoids and vitamin Cs and acids and all that stuff just keeping it to the basics I also needed medical intervention so at the time I was prescribed this which is metrogel this is an antibiotic gel often used for people who struggle with rosacea I can say that this was definitely responsible for getting my rosacea under control in that kind of acute flare-up phase that I was in once My Skin Barrier was intact and things were calmed down settled down that's when I could reintroduce the active ingredients into my skincare routine such as my vitamin C retinoids Etc so just because I have rosacea doesn't mean that I can't capitalize on those things it's just sometimes I have to opt for versions that are more sensitive skin friendly and when I have a flare-up I kind of revert back to the basics again just to be sure my Skin's under control before I reintroduce those active ingredients in my skincare routines the next thing and it's no surprise for those of you who have watched my channel for a while it's the thing that I actually attribute my kind of ongoing success with my rosacea is azelic acid I feel like it is really responsible for keeping my rosacea obey and maintaining My Skin Barrier overall I have used over-the-counter acelaic acid serums for years and I can say some of my favorites are Paula's Choice 10 azoleic acid booster and this one by theramid it's their acid or azid I'm not sure how it's pronounced but this one's at 15 azaleaic acid I was impressed with this one because it's actually the same percentage of azelic acid as my prescription and strength osoletic acid and I fairly recently started this prescription phenacea finessia tomato tomato I'm not sure but it's a 15 prescription only here in Canada as oleic acid now the different approach I've had with this one versus the other ones is that I was normally using those once a day generally in my morning skincare routine paired with my vitamin C but I've been using this one now for about six weeks twice a day morning and evening skincare routine it's another reason I love this as a product azelic acid it pairs well with so many other things it really doesn't have conflicts you don't have to worry about it I use it in my evening skincare routine paired with my retinoid in my morning skincare routine pair with my vitamin C the only thing I don't do is I don't put it in the same routine as my acid day when I use my aha or Alpha hydroxy acid it's once a week and I just focus on the acid and hydrating skin care products to surround that routine I'm only six weeks into this sort of regime so I will definitely do an update for you later on but already I am reaping the benefits of this overall I can feel that my skin is just more calm and healthy azelic acid has so many health benefits for the skin especially for rosacea it works to decrease the swelling the associated redness but is really effective at targeting the bacteria that's in the pores that can also contribute to the pimples associated with rosacea making this also a great product or great ingredient for those of you with acne prone skin of course there can be Associated side effects I think primarily those are tingling stinging and even drawing of the skin I personally haven't had that experience so I'd love to hear from those of you who perhaps have had that experience you can share that in the comments section below but certainly if you're using a prescription nasolic acid you'd be in consultation with a medical professional and of course they'd be able to talk to you more about that but if you're using OTC or over-the-counter azoleic acids just be aware you're experiencing that as well I will continue to monitor my rosacea with you and I'll do more updates as we go along and just see how my journey goes because I'm hoping it's helping you to understand more about the disease and spreading awareness which is what the April rosacea awareness month is all about I'll drop some information on that in particular below I would really really love it if you would share your thoughts experiences comments in the comments section below if you haven't watched them already be sure to watch these videos up on screen and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "moisturizers are an essential part of skin care and as a board certified dermatologist i frequently get asked about what i recommend i'm going to share with you guys my all-time drugstore favorite facial moisturizers and they're all 20 or less my name is dr jenny liu i'm a board survived dermatologist and welcome to my youtube channel now before we jump into um what i recommend i want to just say a few things about moisturizers all skin needs a moisturizer even if you have oily skin you still will benefit from using a moisturizer when you look at a moisturizer an effective moisturizer contains three components occlusives so ingredients like petrolatum or fatty acids like shea butter that helps to seal in moisture two emollients ingredients like panthenol or even certain fatty acids it helps to seal in moisture but also soften the skin and three humectants most commonly well known is hyaluronic acid as well as glycerin that helps to draw water to the top layer of the skin to keep the skin supple and hydrated i'm going to share with you today moisturizers that i really like for all skin types from dry to sensitive mature skin to those with oily skin so hopefully this will give you guys some ideas when you are shopping a moisturizer for your skin type first one that i recommend is the cetaphil redness reliefing nighttime moisturizer this retails for about 15 bucks i really like this one for dry and most importantly sensitive skin it contains ingredients are really helpful for soothing sensitive skin great for those with rosacea prone skin it contains licorice caffeine and aloe tone which are ingredients that we know that help to fight inflammation and soothe the skin in addition it contains ceramide shea butter and fatty acids it helps to support and repair the skin barrier this moisturizer is fragrance free so again very suitable for those with sensitive and rosacea prone skin now i have to say i don't have rosacea but i do have more dry skin with that especially in the winter time and with my job and having to wear a mask my skin has definitely become more sensitive and this is by far the only moisturizer that i've used that really hasn't caused burning on my skin personally i would take that redness relief name with a grain of salt we know that individuals with rosacea will often have redness due to broken capillaries from the sensitivity so don't expect this moisturizer to really remove that redness component um because that really ultimately needs to be treated with like light or laser treatment however if you are experiencing redness from more skin irritation i do feel that the ingredients in this moisturizer and the formulation which is like a thicker cream will help with that component it is pretty hydrating and moisturizing so if you have oily skin you may not like the feel of this as much but for me and for most individuals with more dry sensitive and rosacea prone skin i think this is a great one to consider the next one i really like is the survey skin renewing nighttime moisturizer this retails for about 19 bucks this is a very rich moisturizer great for again sensitive skin dry skin as well as mature skin it contains surveys blend of essential ceramides hyaluronic acid nice cinnamide as well as a blend of peptides and it's a really great hydrating moisturizer i personally love this one because for me i love a thicker moisturizer at night and also for those who have more aged skin are looking for a more affordable moisturizer to fight signs of aging i think this is a really great option the peptides in here really help to temporally plump the skin and there are some good data showing that peptides can improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles also i think this is a great option for those who are starting to use a retinol to help you tolerate your retinols more and combat the irritation and dryness that you will often experience with a retinol or retinoid-based product i don't really recommend using this in the morning it is a little bit too heavy thick and slightly greasy but at night it's a perfect one that i often will use on my skin especially during the winter next up is la roche posay's tularean double facial repair moisturizer this retails for roughly twenty dollars and i think this is just a really great all-around moisturizer that can be used by pretty much all skin types it's very very versatile it is oil free but yet it's still very hydrating and moisturizing it contains ceramide glycerin and niacinamide that's great for repairing and soothing the skin barrier it's fragrance free so also great for those with sensitive skin it's also oil free the formulation is a hydrating cream but very lightweight and absorbs really quickly so for those with acne prone skin that are wanting something a little bit more substantial for the winter time i think this is a great moisturizer to try for those with more dry and sensitive skin you know i think test it out for the winter depending on where you live i think this is great option for me with more dry skin and living in the tundra here in minneapolis when we frequently have days where it's like negative 20 degrees out i just want something a little bit heavier and thicker at night but i will often use this as my morning moisturizer because it absorbs really quickly it still is very hydrating and a great one to use under sunscreen so next up is one of my all-time favorite gel cream formulations in drugstores and that is the neutrogena hydro boost gel cream for extra dry skin this one i love because it is number one fragrance free so great to use for those who have more sensitive skin even though it's a gel cream formulation it's a little bit lighter but it's still very hydrating so great for those with more dry skin i think this is like the la roche posay tularean fairly versatile and can be used by all skin types just depending on kind of where you live and and this season which gina has done quite a bit of clinical studies on their hydro boost line and their hydro boost line is really well known for hyaluronic acid and they have various different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid that kind of help to improve the skin moisture barrier at various levels within the top layer of the skin to help draw water and temporarily plump the skin improve dry skin dehydrated skin and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and i love the fact that it's a gel cream because even though it's got that cream word in there it absorbs quickly doesn't feel sticky but still is able to provide adequate hydration if you have oily skin i think this is a great option to use all year round for those with dry skin i think this is a great option to use as your morning moisturizer under sunscreen in the summertime or all year round again depending on where you live and this is a great option for those who tend to have more oily skin but get dehydrated so you're wanting really to improve that hydration but not wanting anything heavy or greasy or oily my last favorite drugstore moisturizer and this is great for those with oily skin who don't really want to use a moisturizer or who have oily skin but get easily dehydrated check out burst dew point moisturizing gel cream this one i love because literally it's so lightweight and i think for those who are with oily skin or live in more like a humid environment this one literally it feels like after it's absorbed that you haven't really put anything on your skin it's also fragrance free so for those with more sensitive skin i think you can definitely try it out it contains hyaluronic acid green tea and aloe ingredients are very helpful for soothing plumping the skin and repairing the skin moisture barrier how i would use this for me is i loved using it in the summertime again for those with oily skin that gets or just have purely dehydrated skin and want something lighter i highly recommend checking this one out so that's it guys those are my top five drugstore moisturizers for 20 or less if you enjoy this video or want to know more about my other moisturizers that are not limited by

        "transcript": "good morning good morning welcome back to the Vlog today I am GNA of course start my skincare routine and I was thinking about those of you out there with Rosa you deal with burning stinging symptoms of sensitivity when you use your skincare products with rosacea people develop redness on the cheeks little bumps that are red and filled with pus but in people who have deeper skin tones those skin signs sometimes are missed um or are not as obvious especially to the untrained eye and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up getting misdiagnosed and they have rosacea so talking about symptoms with your doctor is one of the most helpful pieces of information for guiding the diagnosis of Ros but symptoms include burning stinging itch sensations of warmth in the face that come and go as well as discomfort in the eyes and of course problems with skin care products and cosmetics if you have rosacea cleansing can be a really delicate tricky balance because definitely can burn and sting and can wear away at your already kind of weaken Skin Barrier to make those symptoms of sensitivity worse a lot of cleansers burn and sting so use a really gentle mild creamy cleanser if you're feeling really sensitive use lukewarm water and try just washing your face once a day cleansing oils and cleansing balms are a great option to remove um dirt oil and Cosmetics first because they're less likely to burn and sting got to get the drips off all right I'm coming in with the healthy renew face serum I've really been enjoying this now this would be a good option for a lightweight hydrating serum if you have sensitive skin because this whole product line is meant for people with sensitive skin and it's moisturizing to help minimize the symptoms of sensitivity but it's this particular Serum is not heavy sometimes heavy moisturizers for people with rosacea can actually elicit a flush not everyone but some people so the face cream in this line I really like but it is very rich so if you are sensitive to really heavy moisturizers and you want something more lightweight go with the serum for my sunscreen today I'm going to use a cavey hydrating sheer sunscreen I reviewed this a while ago it's a hybrid sunscreen it's water resistant um it's all right um but I want to use it up you know I buy these products to try out and review and then I want to make sure I finish them so they don't go to waste this hybrid sunscreen is more the consistency is more of a almost a fluid it kind of is like a cross between a fluid and a cream hybrid sunscreen just means zinc plus some organic AKA chemical filters so the cast in I find is a lot less noticeable in comparison to an all mineral but I also find that these hybrid sunscreens are a lot less likely to sting in comparison to the organic AKA chemical sunscreens so if you find that organic sunscreens chemical sunscreens burn sting but you're put off by the heavy white cast of an all mineral sunscreen try a hybrid sunscreen it's a nice balance it's not a zero cast though if you have a deeper skin tone it will show up but it is a lot less noticeable and a lot of people with deeper skin tones end up using the hybrid sunscreens and they say you know after a while it just kind of Blends in and it's not so bad it all depends on your background skin tone though I wish these Brands would provide samples that way you know how it's going to look on your skin before you buy the bottle because while I like to think my reviews help you guys in deciding whether or not you're going to buy something or not you can't really tell just looking at how a product looks on my skin how it's necessarily going to look for you anytime somebody leaves a comment in any one of my videos like saying is this a good sunscreen for oily skin almost always either on a video or like a Tik Tok or something almost always there'll be someone who's like I've got oily skin I love this it's my Holy Grail then there'll be another P person who's like no stay away it's too greasy it's too oily so even those you know those kinds of things it's like you kind of just have to try it for yourself honestly um to see if it ends up working this one is a little bit shiny it's water resistant though which is nice like for humidity and sweat easy to tolerate around the eyes for me again that's another very individualized thing one thing too about sunscreen is that it also helps with the impaired skin barrier and helps reduce symptoms of sensitivity once you have it on there because it's you know helping to reduce water loss and limit penetration and irritance into the skin it's almost like a barrier cream in a sense depending on the consistency especially and sunscreens like this with zinc um are soothing you know zinc can be is anti-inflammatory although some zinc sunscreens are in my experience and yours cuz you guys have told me on the drawing side so I mentioned to you guys the other day that this like new thing that I've been enjoying doing is listening to my audio book which I'm still making my way through um it's called Uh Crossroads anyway so at night to unwind like when I'm making dinner I like to put my headphones on and just listen to the audiobook it kind of helps me tune out and like keeps me from you know Doom scrolling in my mind of just like things that I need to do and it just helps me inwind anyway but you know something about that like you've got to wash behind your ears is the point I'm trying to make like it's a it's an area where a lot of people end up forgetting to wash but um especially if you're wearing headphones a lot because back here you can get a lot of oily buildup and CC dermatitis I actually like to use an anti-dandruff shampoo back here to to clean behind my ears this is an area where you know similar to dandruff on your scalp and SE dermatitis on your face you can get this oily flaky itchy inflame buildup so I like to do that and when you're wearing headphones a lot that creates a moist humid environment that's really more favorable for that little yees malesia so it can make you know this kind of problem behind the ears even more of an issue for you so stay on top of clean it behind your ears kids so I bought this blood pressure monitor cuff on Amazon I've been pretty happy with it because it will syn to an app on your phone so you can keep a log of your blood pressure and heart rate I find that is something that's really useful a useful metric like I'm not I try to not get too into like tracking all these Health metrics because it's sort of like what are you going to do with all that information then you just become like you know somebody who just writes down numbers all the time like how many steps you got in a day like how many hours of sleep and it just becomes like to what end you know what I mean but uh all that to say having a Rec of your blood pressure readings over a period of time it can be a very useful information uh to provide to your doctor because a lot of people um deal with what they call white coat hypertension meaning your blood pressure goes up in the doctor's office cuz maybe you're nervous stressed out um they call it white coat hypertension like because they attribute it to being nervous about the doctor but honestly it's gotten to a point where the amount of time you have to wait in a doctor's office is so frustrating that it gets your blood pressure up too so it should be like um you know waiting room waiting room hypertension like the stress of of having to wait anyway um so I got this and I've been really happy with it the cuff is um standard size and it it also will fit a large larger arm and it's been doing well so yeah it's it's useful and I I think you know like I said what what good are all these numbers well like if you go to the doctor's office and you have a higher a blood pressure reading on the higher end they're probably you know going to tell you to maybe check it again and you know it can kind of be a thing so having this and having a record to show them is really helpful because a lot of times your blood pressure will will run a certain way and it'll be very different in the office so that's handy to have I've got my little pumpkin back there I'm still burning the Tuscany trick-or treat candle the cupcake one it's not my favorite favorite scent I think I've complained about this already in multiple Vlogs and I have re I purchased a new another candle on their Halloween set that I'm I'm itching to buy I'm itching to to light into but I have this thing in my personality where like with the candle I'm going to burn it unless it's like really really foul which this is isn't it's just kind of like you know I know Tuscany can give a better candle profile um unless it's just really foul I'm going to burn that thing all the way and I'm not going to start a new candle until I finished it some people burn more than one candle at a time and let the the fragrances like mingle and I bet that's really nice if you get the right pairing but I'm always like on the fence about if I should do that or if it's going to be like weird and and and mess things up like I think one of my favorite to skinny candles is the Lemon sugar cookie and I really think that the lemon sugar cookie would be nice over like some of those more Berry scents I think that would be like a nice kind of way to blend those two but I don't know what would go good with cupcake maybe a cinnamon scented candle so it was a gorgeous day on this Sunday I had to get out I could not spend it inside as you can see the sky is really really blue and gorgeous I'm over by the River Oaks neighborhood where they're all these Mansions I love to drive by these houses and just Ogle them lot of them have these like massive walls in front of them so you can't really see them too well but over the holidays this neighborhood is really fun to come to because they go all out lighting up their mansions and they all look beautiful uh it's just something to see something to behold I wanted to go to Memorial Park um and so that's a bit of a drive but it kind of ended up to be a fail because actually I could not find a parking space uh because everybody wanted to get out which like I've said in other Vlogs I try and get outside as much as possible during the day it's actually really good for your sleep cycle for your mental health to get outside in during daylight hours and spend time Outdoors uh as much as possible like especially if you work swing shifts can really help set your clock back so because I couldn't find a place to park I ended up coming over to Rice Village uh area and they have that nice walking trail uh getting some Cloud footage here I just think it's so Zen but I used to walk around this uh Park a lot um in my older apartment but I I haven't been here in a while it's always a fun time let me know in the comments I think some of you went to Rice so hopefully this footage brings back fond memories of your own stomping grounds but uh I love the pretty oak trees that line This walking path I did not know that this existed this Garden back here it's for the students but I had to come and check it out they have all sorts of beautiful flowers the garden was actually closed but you can it is open to the I guess open to the public um during certain hours yeah here's a little sign I guess um some alumni donated money for this garden and the idea is like to have a space for students to come and like learn about gardening so maybe one day they will have their own garden all right so I am going to show you guys some double cleansing in action here uh this particular night I decided I was going to use I've been using that DHC deep cleansing oil that I got from sty and I have rather been enjoying it it's very similar to the hot alabo cleansing oil um similar ingredients like olive oil but it has an aroma to it to it it has I think it has Rosemary in it so you can definitely smell that but it's a pleasant cleansing oil to use one of the reasons I love using cleansing oil so much is they're just a effective at removing Cosmetics like on this particular day I'm wearing uh that Lancome adol mascara I'm also wearing their waterproof eyeliner and this really does a good job getting in there dissolving it breaking it up I can't do makeup removers I always burn my eyes sting my skin if you have rosacea we were talking about this at the beginning of the Vlog but if you have rosacea um and you're looking for a way to remove makeup try cleansing oil or cleansing balm alternatively another good option is Cold Cream like the pwns cold cream is really a good option because it dissolves the makeup but it also is like very soothing um I don't you know they call it cold cream and it does kind of feel nice and chilled going on the skin but the oil is another option or a cleansing balm the main difference between like cleansing balm and cleansing oil it's just the balm is solid at room temperature I also started using the um isant yam root vegan milk cleanser oh my gosh those of you with sensitive skin rosacea consider this mild cleanser because it's such a pleasant experience it's free of fragrance it's very hydrating it has this like slippery texture to it which may be offputting for some but I really enjoy it it almost kind of cloaks your skin in a hug as it Glides across the surface of the skin and gently cleanses without disrupting the underlying Skin Barrier you see with the double cleanse approach the first step the oil cleanser is kind of just like getting in there and breaking up residue buildup on the skin surface the second step with the mild cleanser is actually getting in there and cleansing everything away so that's why I like doing it that way typically I do the second step in the shower but I decided to do it here so you guys could see this cleanser in action and as you can see it took everything off well hey guys I am all clean moisturized hydrated got my tread noan on but um one of the things I was thinking about you know on Sundays I do a Q&A over on my Instagram and I also post it to Facebook or basically I just you know post a still image of myself and I say hey drop any skincare related questions in the comments of this Instagram post or this Facebook post and I will usually answer you know a handful of them as many as I can and I post the question and the response to my Instagram stories and it's saved in a highlight bubble if you go to my Instagram profile anyway one of the questions I got today was like how do you deal with dry eyelids especially if you live in a cold dry climate and I got to tell you petroleum jelly is a game Cher for dry eyelids or eyelid eczema because it prevents water loss really well and it also um prevents penetration of irritance into the skin so it really is a is a great option plus it's free of common allergens and irritant I mean it's basically your immune system really doesn't care about Vaseline so that's a good thing it's just like an inert little barrier support there it's really underrated for all the things you can do it's also beneficial for cutting down on chafing wind bur if you live somewhere cold and windy um what a day y'all today was gorgeous like so nice when the weather is beautiful because you just want to be outside and so soaking it all in and such a mood boost I'm telling you summertime here can get a little like you know winter months get in other places because it's really just too hot to safely be outside for long stretches of time so you kind of get a little you know the a bit of the Blues in the summertime but that being said I really love summer and I find that you know I'm happy as can be throughout the summer cuz I like all of the summer festivities like the summer holidays and summer food summer fruits I really like summer and I love the beach so I don't know winter here I I don't mind because it's pretty mild but winter is not not where it's at for in my mind like no thanks uh I'm not I'm not Team Winter I do like winter when I don't have to go anywhere then it's fine you know it's like all cozy with a fireplace and my coffee and it's relaxing sure winter time sounds Divine but the realities of existing places that have strong you know intense Winters no thank you I don't want to be out there shoving now no thanks defrosting uh the windshield I hate doing that uh I hate driving in icy conditions cuz it's not fun although I got really good at driving in snow when I lived in Colorado like I had this little trick sometimes I get stuck in the snow like in a parking space like you'd park somewhere and then maybe you'd be parked there for a while and then we get a huge dumping of snow and you kind of have to dig your car out the car I had at the time I remember I would get in it and you know you kind of like try and dig some of the snow out as best you could heat up the car so it was somewhat def you know defrosted and then I remember I would like move it forward and back and forward and back and then I would like myself I would I could rock my own car and I could get it to rock out of the out of the space and float away I got good at that you know there's certain things that are really intimidating but once you learn how to do them and you just become comfortable and it becomes a necessity that you do it and do it efficiently then it's like not a big deal anymore like parallel parking is one of those things where you just put yourself in that situation and get uncomfortable a handful of times eventually it will just be like no big deal um that's that's a lot of things like if there's anything that you are intimidated about doing or you're like apprehensive you just kind of have to throw yourself in that situation and I mean provided it's not like hazardous to your health or something you know what I mean like within reason just throw yourself in that situation and be uncomfortable for a couple of times and eventually it just be such a non-issue that you'll start doing it all the time and you'll look back and be like why was I ever freaked out about doing this it's like non B deal all right y'all I am going to wrap this Vlog up I've had a great day I hope you have had a great day thank you so much for watching to the end if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in today's video I'm going to share with you some products that I think will be really helpful for those of you out there suffering with a redness on the face whether it be due to rosacea or acne that heals with redness also those of you out there with darker skin types who are coping with hyperpigmentation listen up many of these products will help you as well because one of the challenges that people with darker skin may not appreciate is that redness can actually show up looking a little bit more like discoloration and if you've got some background hyperpigmentation going on it can actually be kind of challenging to distinguish redness from hyperpigmentation and you may actually have both things going on the first product that I'm going to recommend for you guys is a face wash at the end of the day is when I cleanse my skin and I only cleanse my skin once a day you can cleanse your skin twice a day but if you're dealing with redness try and keep it just to once a day the more times you put cleanser on your face and wash your face more likely it is to dry your skin and lead to worsening redness and I can really be a challenge to choose a cleanser if you cope with redness because all cleansers that are intended as it should be to remove dirt oil makeup all that goop off your skin they actually take some of your natural skin barrier with it and that makes you more predisposed to dryness and irritation a cleanser that is really good at minimizing this damage to the barrier but it does a good job taking off all the gunk is the sarony hydrating creamy cleanser this has Stara minds which are restoring for the skin barrier and it's free of added fragrance it's really a good choice so if you find that that one stings and burns a sagging cleanser that I would recommend for people with redness is the first aid beauty at face cleanser this product was sis with FA B antioxidant booster anyways this product has a licorice root extract as you many of the products I'm going to mention in today's video and licorice root is well known to be calming for redness and to inflammatory so you will see it in a lot of products marketed for people with redness so this has that in it and honestly I find that I don't know if it's all in my head with a licorice root but I do appreciate that this has kind of a calming soothing effect on the skin when I use it it also has fever if you extract in it as you many products aimed at people with redness feverfew has like a licorice root and shown to calm down redness and be anti-inflammatory however some people are easily irritated by that ingredient and were allergic to it the most allergenic part of feverfew is something called Perth dental line but in cosmetics that's actually been removed so it's pretty low risk but some people still are bothered by it if that's you then you might want to avoid this but otherwise it's really good and it's cruelty free it's pretty affordable so I love this one obviously it goes without saying I'm going to tell you you have to protect your skin from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun everyone has to do this but in the case of redness it's really important because ultraviolet radiation actually drives a lot of inflammation of the skin baser dilation and contributes to excess redness in the case of the melasma and these diseases of hyperpigmentation not only does the ultraviolet radiation Drive that inflammatory component that yields redness but it also pushes your skin towards making more pigment abnormally and creating hyperpigmentation so really important so I think a sunscreen that is tinted is a great option because the tent will help to camouflage some of the redness and in the case of hyperpigmentation the tent will also offer you some additional protection against pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light a sunscreen that's really great if you have fair skin and are looking for a tinted sunscreen is the exudes sheer daily protector this is a mineral sunscreen it only has as its active sunscreen ingredient zinc and titanium dioxide its mineral only and so for people with redness sunscreens that have chemical filters in them can cause more irritation and redness they don't get along well with them so I wanted to make sure I chose one that was mineral only this one is also great because it has green tea in it which is helpful for calming down redness it's anti-inflammatory gives a little bit of acne control and has been shown to diminish the appearance of pores it looks really good on the skin and it doesn't burn or sting around the eyes it doesn't ball or pull up or any of those nuisance e things but if you have a darker skin type you might find that the tint on this it's still pretty fair and kind of looks chalky Caste if you have a darker skin type a mineral only tinted sunscreen that works really well for darker skin types it's clear mineral tinted sunscreen or coats I will list suppose both of those down below for you all but if you have more of a medium skin tone the Sun fill redness relieving daily facial moisturizer SPF 20 is a good one to consider it has a licorice root in it which will help calm down that redness its mineral only so it's not gonna be irritating or staying the tint is more on the peachy kind of orange tan side so better for medium skin tones it's only SPF 20 so I recommend actually putting this on over a mineral only on tinted sunscreen that way you kind of camouflage you can use you need a higher SPF mineral sunscreen as your base layer and then kind of camouflage it with this so it helps mask that white cast and it also helps in providing some cosmetic camouflage against the redness and this looks really nice on the skin actually this I kind of considered this like a BB cream or a CC cream for those of you in the UK I did not forget about you I have sunscreen recommendations for both fair skin and darker skin type no these are chemical sunscreens so they might sting a little bit but the chemical filters in these are excellent for providing really really broad spectrum coverage of all wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation that can affect your skin and lead to redness and pigmentation I honestly don't have a lot of experience with mineral tinted sunscreens from the UK or anywhere in outside of the US I mostly I'm familiar with chemical one so that's why I picked these because I have the greatest familiarity with them altruist is a really sensitive skin friendly but the tint on the altruist is pretty dark so if you you know it's better for darker skin types in other words if you're fair with the rosacea for example you might not care for this in which case I definitely recommend the Bioderma a are SPF 50 plus tint on this is really nice the Alturas one goes on green and that helps in providing some camouflage against the redness and as you blend it onto the skin the other pigments kind of come out and take over and it turns to a darker brown now for people with redness especially related to rosacea it's best if you're gonna wear a makeup to choose makeup that is mineral tends to be very well tolerated for people with rosacea and a product that I enjoy and I think can be helpful is a mineral SPF powder now I reviewed several of these for you guys in the past and I have a few here that I'm gonna recommend but what you have to know about these mineral sunscreen powders is they really are like sprinkles on a cupcake it's a little bit of extra but it's not the whole frosting you need your base layer sunscreen when you put on a mineral powder it doesn't put on an even layer of SPF but it can be helpful for cosmetic camouflage of redness and also masking some of the shine of sunscreen and very well tolerated in people with sensitive skin the first one is the colorscience Unforgettable SPF 50 powder I've worked with this company numerous times but I love their products including this it is very expensive I will give it that but it's a very high SPF and it looks really nice on the skin just in terms of the pigment that they use it really looks nice and it stays on the skin very well it doesn't fall out a lot so I like this one personally but I know it's pretty expensive I know one that's pretty good is the supergroup invisible setting powder now this one doesn't have the spectrum of kind of tint range and depth of tint for cosmetic camouflage at the redness but it does do a really good job in reducing shine its SPF 45 so pretty comparable to the colorscience one a lot less expensive and then a cheapy one works pretty well is the derma derma e essential sun protection mineral powder SPF 30 a little bit lower but much less expensive zinc and titanium dioxide and it looks really good on the skin alright moving into the category of moisturizers moisturizing your face particularly namely a nighttime like after you cleanse the skin is really important for redness because when you cleanse the skin the skin barrier becomes impaired also just as part of redness a lot of that has to do with the dryness and irritation using a moisturizer can really address that barrier defect and help in rescuing your skin so to speak I adore the procurer rosa care product again with licorice root extract and this is a green tint so it will give you some cosmetic camouflage of the redness you may be wondering like why do I care about that at nighttime you actually can use this again in the morning if you wanted to underneath your sunscreen just make sure it dries fully before putting the sunscreen on it's very soothing in addition to the licorice root extract it also has niacinamide which will also help not only for calming down inflammation and irritation but can also have helped in issues related to hyperpigmentation this is really a good choice for those of you with a darker skin type that has a lot of hyperpigmentation plus redness that's a good choice mixture I love bioderma sensibio AR as well yeah the Bioderma moisturizers as liquorice we announced a soy extract I believe both of which can be anti-inflammatory and calm down redness but also helpful for hyperpigmentation Hannon has laminaria extract which is a marine extract and I've talked about those before they are competitive with hyaluronic acid for water binding capacity so this is a really a good one for our adding hydration into the skin as well as soothing redness alright and then indeed lasse has these color series of color correctors they have like one for yellow kind of sallow skin one for just hyperpigmentation but they've got a redness one this is the one I'm most familiar with nano blur and the color green it really helps as well I don't believe it has any active ingredients that address redness it's really more just that green tint that blends into the skin and camouflages out that redness this is really nice it kind of has like a blurring of back Domas as it alludes to in the title nano blur and this is a nice moisturiser for a night time or you could try using this under your sunscreen as well just again make sure it dries fully that way when you put the sunscreen on you kind of get take advantage of that green tint see if you use a product like this over your sunscreen it wipes the sunscreen off so the sunscreen has to be the last thing but if you put the sunscreen on moisturizer and while they're damp it can interfere with how the film is formed with a sunscreen so make sure it's fully dry that's what I'm getting at so key aspect of skin care keep it simple keep it minimal a few products is best especially when it comes to irritation redness discoloration more stuff you put on and more likely not it is to get worse any time people ask me in the comments how do i layer XYZ T&F together or product it's Z and Q can they be combined whatever you start wanting to combine all of these different products from multiple different manufacturers you're really going into an unknown there's no objective answer to a lot of these questions other than on you're probably just putting yourself at increased risk for irritation and potentially compromising the if efficacy of the actual active ingredients by keeping things really simple and just checking to the bare minimum you really maximize chances of good outcome from the actual active ingredient you're pursuing in the case of many of these products it might be licorice root and minimizing the risk of irritation and skin problems that would have been worse than your redness but yeah those are the products for redness that I can recommend you guys I know it's not fun to deal with redness people are not nice like people will ask why's your face rad it's like why are you so rude why are you a jerk I mean obviously you know your face is red so yeah I hope these products are helpful and this video is useful to you if you liked it give the thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

        "transcript": "now one of the most difficult things about rosacea is finding skin care that works for you and not against you so often the wrong thing can be the actual cause of a flare so today's video is all about giving you that essential tool kit so you have all the right ingredients in your skincare routine to help you tame the flames of rosacea now make sure you stay right to the very end because i'll be sharing my favorite ingredient last so the first ingredients i want to talk about are in fact spf filters because in my mind there is no skin care routine for rosacea that isn't underpinned by effective sun protection and that's because of the huge role that uva plays in rosacea and potentially triggering disease so when it comes to rosacea i am a fan of mineral filters meaning zinc oxide and titanium dioxide they just tend to do a better job less irritating great coverage and as a bonus i think that the right mineral sunscreen can actually really brighten the skin helping mask redness and serving as a great base for makeup now i i'm really dependent on gossamer tint one for that reason not only does it allow me to have the old day where i don't wear any makeup at all bar a little bit of concealer under my eyes because it evens out my complexion masking a little bit of that redness but also just delivering a really kind of glass skin glow and that's because of the way zinc and titanium look on the skin there's a reason why titanium dioxide is a component of many foundations but great for sensitive skin um great post procedure as well this is the kind of sunscreen we use after laser treatments and the like um and really i think a foundation when it comes to treating rosacea so when it comes to active rosacea the topical ingredient i find most helpful nowadays is actually something called ivamectin or sulantra on prescription something you'd have to get through your gp or dermatologist i just find it to be the most helpful thing when someone is undergoing a spotty flare some flare in the popular postular phase tends to be the thing that brings it under control most effectively and i also really like how it's formulated the base of this particular active is really soothing and kind and generally well tolerated in rosacea prime skin so i will typically use that at night to calm a flare sometimes in conjunction with oral antibiotics and over time typically i will transition from using cilantro maybe after six weeks maybe after 12 into using something else that is more about disease prevention so cilantro i reserve for the active spotty flares then coming on to more traditionally anti-inflammatory ingredients that we use in skin care niacinamide is something that i like a lot in those who are rosacea prone now it's often found in moisturizers like an hour of flawless moisturizer it's present at five percent just as it's in revival mask at 10 and i do think it's worth considering as an active and not just a moisturizing ingredient somebody actually made this point in one of our testimonials on the website i thought you know it's a good point i think it can easily get sort of lumped in with other ingredients like ceramides but in its own right niacinamide is an active not only does it help support barrier function increasing skin's own production of ceramides but it also helps stimulate collagen production it helps improve hyperpigmentation and you know it's anti-inflammatory so therefore potentially helpful with active papules and pustules in its own right but just like any active it can be something that causes irritation so always introduce new active ingredients even if they're in a moisturizer with care but typically those who've got redness prone skin find this to be really helpful then we come on to retinoids which can be a tricky topic in context of rosacea however when the timing is right i think they are profoundly useful so the timing is not right if you are having an active inflammatory flare the timing is worth considering if things are calm and we're really just looking to increase the density of the dermis which is something that i think given that we know that rosacea occurs in light-eyed light-skinned individuals who are potentially um exposed to uva as a consequence of you know everyday life i think it's really important to think about this as part of a holistic approach to managing rosacea um so timing has to be right the ingredient type has to be right so i'm not talking about going full tilt with tretinoin 0.05 i'm talking about dipping your toe in the water when things are calm to see if your skin will get on board now in the non-prescription space that might be something like granactive retinoid or retinaldehyde and on the prescription side of things i often use a dappling or differin cream not gel to test the waters to see if somebody is actually going to respond and when people do respond they respond well i mean as somebody with erythematology which can't even say it today erythematologic rosacea myself um i have definitely had to tread carefully when it comes to using a retinoid in my skin but it's necessary in terms of the general health and well-being so i'm just respectful and then saving the best to last azelaic acid i don't think i can even think of a single rosacea patient who doesn't rely on azelaic acid as part of their ongoing strategy for their rosacea maintenance and again i count myself in that azolic acid is just so helpful in rosacea because of its ability to down regulate that over enthusiastic inflammatory response part of what we call the innate immune system which when it's challenged by the external environment you know whether it's weather related whether it's things that we put on it or you know whether it's triggered by the things that we ingest azelaic acid just dials it down really nicely and the great thing is there is now you know a proliferation of azelaic acid-base products on the market so we can get on prescription phonation skinner in different percentages but essentially delivering the same amount of ingredient into the skin and then over the counter we have good old brightly serum with 10 azelaic acid and some other active ingredients alongside it including niacinamide and you know the ordinary has a really affordable version too so azolic acid i've talked about it at length before but i think for the rosacea sufferer particularly those who are concerned about staying fresh um it has additional benefits it's good for pigmentation it's good for texture it's a powerful antioxidant it's so versatile that you know as i've said many times before there has to be a really good reason for it not to be in the mix i've not mentioned metronidazole which it has historically been one of the antibiotic topicals that we use in rosacea i have to say that in my practice i have now evolved to almost exclusively using cilantro and azelaic acid information or skin or in format almost exclusively i just don't tend to use metronidazole topically at all anymore in part because the physical nature of those preparations often wasn't something that patients enjoy using they're often quite unpleasant in terms of the way they would layer on the skin but i just don't find them to be as effective but worth mentioning because if it's something that has worked for you and you get on with the preparations available that's you know metro gel or rosex cream then absolutely fine to keep going they are a recognized part of the treatment toolkit so i hope by now you're starting to feel like you have a bit more control over your rosacea you know where to turn to in terms of getting the right ingredients to tackle it and i'm going to be doing another couple of videos in this series um so you have a really complete bank of knowledge um when it comes to the nuances of dealing with rosacea and know that i'm with you on this journey it's something that i have you know honed my kind of skin care practices over the years to ensure that i get the best possible result in terms of managing my own tendency towards rosacea um so i hope it was helpful please do share this content with anybody who needs to know more about dealing with rosacea and i'll see you guys again soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "hi friends welcome back to my channel I'm Sarah Martin with the contoured chemist and today I'm coming at you makeup free because we're going to be talking a little bit about skin care and more specifically rosacea this is something I have a lot of experience with it is rosacea awareness month and so I'm going to go into what it is the best products and ingredients to use to keep it under control and my regimen if you want to check it out please keep watching be sure to hit that like And subscribe button and as always thank you guys for being [Music] [Applause] [Music] here oh friends rosacea I've have been asked to cover this subject many times and I figured you know what I've never talked about it and it's rosacea awareness month so this is the perfect time before the end of April I'm I'm squeezing it in here at the last week so what I find most interesting about rosacea is that most people don't even realize they have it I will be honest I didn't know I had it I just thought I was a little red and I wasn't sure until I was at the dermatologist and they said oh you have a little rosacea right there and I was like what I do I had no clue and most people don't really realize that the only way um of diagnosing it is visually and so you might not know it unless you're actively at the dermatologist regularly and since I'm constantly getting skin checks that's how I found out I had it 15 million Americans 115 million worldwide it's extremely common so what exactly is rosacea it's actually a chronic inflammatory skin condition and it is a medical condition so unfortunately there is no cure but there are ways you can control it and so I'm going to be going over a lot of that today um it's something that I know I've been experimenting with and trial and error for years even before I had it just to kind of control my redness so if you have frequent blushing if you frequently feel warm to the touch you frequently blush but usually rosacea comes and goes I always say if it's redness that fluctuates that's Rosa you can actually just start with like skin sensitivity if you feel like your Skin's getting a little sensitive and it's actually something that I guess I didn't realize because I didn't you don't have it as an adolescent you don't have it when you're younger it is the age 30 to 60 so a lot of times it doesn't show up until you get into your mid-30s and then you're just like why am I suddenly red why is my skin suddenly more sensitive unfortunately that's Ros obviously it's most common in white Caucasian fairer skin tone honestly that's because it's more easily diagnosed because you can see it more the the difference and the redness and their skin tone it's more apparent and like I said it's only something that is visually diagnosed say 30 to 50% of the Caucasian population have it is in Darker skin tones as well you just can't see it as easily now like I said there is no known cure but that's mainly because there is a lot of agreement on what actually causes it um and nobody knows for sure but there's a lot of different things that they've noticed in those with rosacea genetics is for for sure a huge part of it you notice people with rosacea actually have more more of a common skin parasite known as dimdex um it sounds really gross but like it is a common skin Mite that is on normal skin so everyone has it they've just know noticed that those with rosacea tend to have more of them they think maybe it's because of hyperactive blood vessels our inflammatory systems are different and most think it's just a combination probably all of them and then there's culmination and that can kind of determine how bad yours is because it really can fluctuate person to person time a year all of those things it does take experimenting to figure out what can control it for your skin I always say everyone's skin is so different what will alleviate some of your symptoms have to learn certain triggers so there are a lot of known triggers for rosacea I most certainly have figured out mine over the years do not put me on uh patio in summer and give me any alcohol of any sort or you will see me I will turn as red as a tomato it's so bad sunlight heat alcohol um even worse I've noticed are hot alcoholic drinks like what is it called an Irish coffee hot totty I don't even know but those are like the worst a hot alcoholic beverage forget about it learn your triggers learn those lifestyle choices and some of these are honestly impossible to avoid but like just know these are all possibilities and you'll kind of be able to assess your own skin and what your triggers are anything that can bring that Rush of Blood to the face so sun exposure okay wear your sunscreen totally helps wind heat heat is a big one for me that is changes of temperature any hot climate hot showers saunas steam like my husband wants a sauna for our house and I was like no no I I will never use it it will just inflame my rosacea and bring out my hyperpigmentation two of my triggers I know it won't use it so I know there's health benefits but it'll mess up my skin so I'm like hard strenuous exercise um I can't tell you the number of times I've worked out and people are like are you okay my entire face turns beat red and it will for hours and it's like I look at my little son cuz my youngest is the exact same way people are like is he sunburnt and it's like he just played a baseball game I'm like no it's because he does any exercise his total his whole face turns beat red and I'm like he's going to be exactly like me one day there's no stopping it either you can stay as cool as you want it's just blood flow so there's no avoiding that maybe I shouldn't exercise I'm just kidding em stress and this one is a big one emotional stress especially um I can tell you the first instance of my rosacea having a flare up and it was when I was defending my thesis in organic chemistry I remember the practice when I was doing it in front of my um my group I was in and um it just started as like this like redness that started on my chest and worked its way up my neck like visually you could see it and then went all the way over my face so bad that when I finally did have to do my final defense I wore a turtleneck that's how embarrassed I was of this it just the stress like visually just showed itself on my body and I know now that that was just a trigger that was like my first case of rosace no back then I didn't know what it was but I know now okay specific ingredients now this one is going to widely vary from person to person I see a lot of people um like essential oils is a big one I know that one is for me like just because it's a so-called natural ingredient does not mean it isn't irritating for you in fact there's more known allergens for essential oils and natural ingredients than there are synthetic ones because to be honest in a lab it can be controlled and they know the known allergens and so they take those things out but a lot of these natural skincare products that are on the market aren't necessarily better like they sound better that they're not going to be as irritating or sensitizing but in fact a lot of those are way worse essential oils on the label is is something that I um I just got sent a product in PR first time I used it I was like I I can't because it was essential oils as The fragran Fragrant oil extracts look for out for things like that that can be a huge trigger in a lot of people oh the next one's hard spicy foods alcohol caffeine sorry you're going to have to take my coffee from my cold dead fingers like there's certain things that I know all of us are not willing to give up but hot beverages I love my hot beverages I just know I can't put alcohol in hot beverages ever or I will turn so flushed scratchy Fabrics across your skin um like rough exfoliators this one was huge for me again I didn't realize how bad abrasive scrubs and like things like Clarisonic brushes things like that that cause l of manual physical exfoliation that is in any kind of rough manner is very big for those of us that have Ros like I said you can try to avoid those obviously everyone's kind of triggers will be a little bit different okay I want to quickly go over the four types just so you're aware that rosacea really varies as far as um what kind of type and category you're in so I am a type one ooh I don't know if I can even pronounce this this word but I'll put it down here uh urethr it is not a chemistry word it is a medical term therefore arthia is redness and flushing of the skit so I got that part the rest is hard this is the most common this is the butterfly pattern so when they say butterfly pattern this is what's most common for rosacea just think of the shape of a butterfly so across your cheeks forehead nose and Chin so it kind of avoids those other areas and is exactly where my redness is which makes sense because I was diagnosed okay so when blood vessels um or what we call we referred to as broken capillaries and spider veins they're not technically broken capillaries but that's what everyone calls them when they're visible Under the Skin that's type one so if you zoom in I mean obviously around my nose is very visible like I have some large ones but if I really zoom in on my cheek area I can see itty bitty ones some of some people have it a lot more extreme where it's very visible but like if you can see very little ones that's why my redness never fully goes away I always have those um but I can keep that flushing and the increase totally at Bay but you know the damage has been done they're already there when your skin feels warm to the touch like my cheeks if you react to stimuli so this is why when I'm washing my face my face turns very red it's not just a skin sensitivity that's part of rosacea when it turns red on contact like while I'm putting on my makeup and then it has to kind of die back down that's that blood coming to the face it just happens more so in People Like Us which is again why they think it has something to do with that reaction of blood vessels under the skin type two is Papo plus pular um this is when you have redness and bumps and this is what's commonly referred to as acne rosacea but it's not actually acne it's the rosacea so this is when you get pimple like spots bumps okay and so the way you can determine if that is if you actually have acne or not be where rosacea lies and it won't be in other areas you also won't have blackheads okay there's a difference like with acne you will have blackheads here they might look like acne but maybe you do a traditional acne treatment and it just makes it worse that's a good sign that it's actually this type two rosacea and not acne type three is Fus this is most common in men this is the one that you kind of be able to recognize it causes thickening of skin and it actually sometimes they get a bulbous nose and that's caused from excessive growth of tissue and then the fourth which only happens if you have one of the other types is ocular and this is when it starts affecting your eye dry eyes tearing burning gritty swollen Lids reoccurring sty all of those can happen if it gets into your eyes and so all of these things 2 through four four so unless you just have the most common one you need to see a dermatologist if you have four um obviously an optimalist obviously if over-the-counter things don't help you in a good four to 6 weeks then you're not seeing any Improvement um you need to see a dermatologist no matter what video is not meant to diagnose or treat just I'm going to share with you my own experiences with Ros some of you might have it and not even realize it just think you have a little bit of redness I truly saw so many results when I focused on some of these ingredients in my skincare regim so if you have like me multiple issues when it comes to your skin like you want to deal with aging and hyperpigmentation and acne and rosacea and all these things you always want to treat your sensitivity first get that under control before you start incorporating harsh actives to to kind of deal with other things and so this is why I feel like I'm always in that barrier strengthening kind of regimen um those barrier repair days are my favorite to calm my skin and to keep my barrier happy so that I can then incorporate a few days of those actives into my routine so the biggest thing is just avoiding irritating ingredients again you're going to have to exper experiment a little bit what is irritating for your skin cuz irritated me 5 years ago doesn't irritate my skin anymore because I have strengthen my barrier and I know what works for me but it's going to depend on you and how much skin care you've used how much you've experienced and obviously it's always going to be different than somebody else looking for calming products things that will strengthen our barriers treat your skin like it has a damaged barrier your rosacea will improve a lot of these ingredients kind of like overlap skin become more resilient and less reactive that's our goal so at minimum you can keep it very simple and just use a gentle non drying cleanser for your skin type now with rosacea it's not just a specific skin type any skin type from Oily to dry can be rosace can have rosacea and so you still want to pick something gentle non- stripping for your skin at minimum a good cleanser and I would recommend incorporating a toner or Essence if you haven't before something to soothe and calm this is something like the toners of past that are like witch witch hazel and alcohol strong astringent not that type we're talking soothing toner I've seen some of the biggest results by starting to incorporate what I used to think was a unneeded unnecessary step in my routine the it's now like my favorite because I see so many results from them so I'll show you some and then obviously a sunscreen so because our skin is going to be more affected by the Sun a sunscreen is a must now we all know that there's two different types of sunscreens on the market you'll hear them called mineral and chemical which is really inorganic and organic that are classified as mineral you're looking for the word titanium or zinc oxide those are the least sensitizing ingredients now if you've been following me a while you know my favorites are chemical sunscreens um I like uh the more elegant formulas the fact that it they have no white cast but my skin can tolerate them depending on how bad your rosacea is you might feel extremely inflamed when you try a chemical sunscreen and that's because chemicals can be more inzing to that type of skin um so you have to try it um if it works for you great you can use whatever I feel like so many people want to avoid chemical sunscreens for the wrong reasons the only reason you need to avoid one is it's if it is sensitizing your skin if it feels like it's burning if it's ever you know stinging or anything like that that's just causing more irritation and so the entire premise of a rosacea type regimen is to reduce inflammation because this is an inflammatory condition and that means inside the skin um so we're not exacerbating that problem right and then at night obviously some kind of moisturizer now it's got antioxidants and Skin Barrier repair ingredients even a lotos retinol has been shown to reduce inflammation all those things are really great no matter your skin so let's go over some of my favorite ingredients to include and some of my favorite products while I show you kind of my morning routine and ingredients to avoid for rosace first up we have cleansers now I already said stick with a non-drying gentle cleanser I can't stress that enough if your cleanser leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean it is too harsh for Rosa okay so some of my favorites is a myell water this is what I use every morning one specifically for sensitive skin I use this one and then there's also a sensitive skin one from Lage P um Now using it on a cotton round as long as that cotton round is not too scratchy cuz there are some cheap ones out there that are irritating to your barrier okay um you can even use a reusable microfiber cotton like type round um we also have those from saint that are made out of this material that I use in the mornings as well find as long as I use one for sensitive skin they give me no issues so if your skin um is not oily you don't have to do a full cleanse in the morning you can just use something like your water or a micelar say you're wearing makeup or your sunscreen which you should be every day um you could do totally do a double cleanse just with one cleanser or if you like using an oil cleanser I find most of my oil cleanser none of them are really super stripping and harsh there are some balms out there that might have exfoliant in them like enzymes that you can try um but if it's irritating look for an oil like the cintella one or I really love this new one I just started trying which is the lipar uh gentle foaming cleansing oil uh this one is for sensitive skin dry to Extra Dry if it's made for dry skin it's not going to be stripping of oils so that is always like a good clue um but this one has their thermal water shea butter ni camide I love the formulation because it goes on like an oil but then it actually SS up and it's a really cool formula so I've been using this one or I double cleanse with the famous glener so glycerin when we're talking hydrating and repairing glycerin is one of those Superstar ingredients okay it is a humectant and it is very good for sensitive skin this one also have has oat anything with oat is known to calm inflammation and redness and this one also has aloe I think we all know from being sunburnt as maybe a child that aloe is going to reduce redness so those are all great ingredients to look for this one I believe like in the studies they've shown that two weeks after this it has calmed people's rosacea like this I would say if you're looking for one cleanser you have rosacea you really want to see a difference this would be my Holy Grail status as far as a rosacea cleanser it is incredible 50% glycerin I've never seen a cleanser that has that much glycerin in it I'm a huge fan of Glycerin I think it's the it's my favorite humectant so highly recommend this one prequels line a lot of it you'll see me talking about because a lot of it um since it's dermatologist developed it has a lot of amazing ingredients specifically for uh rosacea and they even have like that little seal of approval if you go to their site and you'll see the rosacea Society seal of approval on a lot of their products um which is why I love so many of them they're all incredible for my problematic skin so you've got your very sensitive skin friendly soothing cleanser oh yeah and remember we don't want anything rough or abrasive um I threw away my Clarisonic years ago because it is like a breeding ground for bacteria even the most sensitive brush heads are just going to aggravate anyone's rosacea um so I switched everything to the soft microfiber cloth from Saint these are my favorite the gray ones they don't get dingy they W they wash normally in my laundry like I don't have to be um weird about like hanging them to dry or anything um I have one for every day of the week so I'm never reintroducing bacteria and are super soft and so I feel like I can because I can't Splash my face with water because of my lashes I can remove any cleanser with this and it never irritates my barrier so these are a must okay so in the morning I just use myell water water in evening double cleanse or double cleanse just with this guy game changer now like I said I learned the hard way physical exfoliation on my face always inflamed my skin just made my rosacea come out stronger so I avoid any abrasive scrubs meaning if it's got any kind of gritty particles in it no matter if they advertise them as micro beads or smooth or whatever the case may be I don't use them uh they don't work for me they are they doesn't matter they they're bad right so no physical exfoliation the only physical exfoliation I technically use is this which even though it's soft will give a little bit of exfoliation and then you guys have heard me talk about this so I'm blue in the face cure was my game Cher when I discovered I could get rid of the dead skin on my face without causing me to be more red so technically this is a physical exfoliant so it is a peeling gel if you've never used one they're extremely gentle but you put it on dry skin you rub it around and it kind of rolls up the dead skin inside these little polymers and those polymers though like is the physical exfoliant that is actually like getting the dead skin off like I can completely get it all and I come out and I'm not even red I don't know what magical sorcery it is it's science what can I say but um appealing gel was a game changer I've tried quite a few over the years and this is still my holy gra I recommend your first on your journey to like controlling your rosacea avoiding high percentage vitamin C's retinoids like prescription strength retinoids like tretinoin and high strength peels like glycolic based High percentages every once in a while you you'll notice if you use one you might feel that little tingly a little bit um irritated the next day your skin will be more red okay until your barrier is really like resilient and ready for that I recommend kind of stopping those and sticking to very gentle forms right all of those things have um not as strong strengths right so my recommendation for an exfoliant I love this one because I feel like I can use it more than just once a week and I swear it's the only thing that like I my nose is my biggest thing like it will make my nose just feel so smooth and like decongested I don't know what like every day if I use it the day before it's like the next day I am glow glowy and my nose isn't red but is like this is like my problem area as far as like clogged pores it like keeps them cleared out um it is the pressing glow by medicate um it's a daily exfoliant PHA tonic with enzyme activator okay so enzymes are gentle exfoliants but PHA those polyhydroxy acids are the gentlest of all the ahas I would say look out for phas phas are going to be your best friend you'll be able to use them without that irritation factor and so when my skin is a little bit sensitive I stop everything else and I will just go for this I am obsessed with this one right um even dermaplaning I would say would it be would be my most irritating routine I still do so when I use like a razor and get off peach fuzz at home dermaplaning there's kind of no avoiding you can create like a barrier by using an oil down fur so it's not as exfoliating but you're putting a blade against your skin and taking off hair like that manual removal of dead skin is it always makes me red and so just know if that is a trigger for you like for me right afterwards I use all of these really calming ingredients and I let my skin recover for a couple days like I know that's just part of my routine now so let's get into toners you guys know I have an obsession with toners now so me trying to pick the best ones was hard I would say one of the best um calming ingredients great for rosacea is I've talked about it before hypochlorous acid it can kind of calm and help your barrier so I use this one all the time from prequel again great for sensitized reaction reactive prone skin which is kind of realization in a nutshell right so I spray this all over and then I usually go in with the toner there's so many so many great calming toners most of them are K Beauty I'll be honest they make the best calming toners on the market I feel like Western skincare is starting to get there but um a is one of my favorite the heart leaf is known to be a very soothing ingredient and so it's also got loaded with a lot of other great things like glycerin and panthenol that are good for your barrier as well so these are kind of like the same thing one's in a pad form one's just where you can put it in your hand Splash it on your face I also really love the Haru Haru Wonder this black uh rice one um but I get the one for sensitive skin okay wi in doubt go for the sensitive Peach slices is one of the best lines they actually have an entire line called redness relief that is amazing because all of it will work for um calming rosacea but this one is literally snail we know the how calming snail um is got hyaluronic acid which is humectant and my favorite ingredient cintella which I'll get to more in a minute so this one is a good choice as well I have a lot of toners that would work for this but if I had to pick one I'd probably go with the heart leaf just because it is known to be the most soothing and I notice when I use it it does calm my redness down right away get into a little bit of more of like the nitty-gritty ingredients to look for remember we're thinking sensitive gentle hydrating barrier repair all those things so think high in glycerin camide like green tea aloe oatmeal arnica pantholops going to be cintella asiatica you guys are probably sick of hearing me talk about it but I know so many of you have responded that it has done wonders for your skin as well when I discovered this I noticed an immediate difference in the level of my redness and so this will always be a Holy Grail this is the skin 10104 ampule this is just pure cintella once I discovered this I realized how much it's another things like it's in this and a lot of these products I'm about to show you because it is like this Superstar ingredient that is great at soothing and calming inflammation in the skin so it is an anox here called sea or Tiger's grass there are a lot of lines that are purely around cintella that they make entire like this line is all cintella and all of it like I've tried the cleansing oil I've shown you guys a lot of it all of it is really good it also increases collagen which is one of the reasons why I like to use it cuz I feel like it not only improves your skin hydration and it heals your skin and is great for barrier strengthening but it increases collagen which is an anti-aging ingredient so it's one of the few anti-age ingredients besides I'd say like peptides that you can use with anything and it doesn't it's not going to inflame your rosacea it's not too strong or irritating or anything like that it's just super star so the next one might not be a surprise even though I just said don't use high strength vitamin C vitamin C is one of the best ingredients because it's an antioxidant it's will strengthen your capillaries okay so it's going to cause less redness it'll improve that like flushing of your face over time but it also repairs barrier and it balances bacteria now the thing is I noticed on my own skin if I use those high percent percentage 20% ascorbic acid um I've had to kind of like build my Skin's tolerance up to being able to use something like that um but when my skin is kind of irritated maybe my barrier is a little um not as resilient from just like dermal planning the next the day before or something like that I skip the strong percentages and I go in with something like this which is um a vitamin C derivative okay so this one is a new discovery but it's one of my favorite because this is one of the most soothing amazing formulations now I've raved about beauty of Josie in so many times but this one is literally 68% cintella um which which I just went over and then it's got a vitamin C derivative which those derivatives have to be converted to ascorbic acid once they get in your skin which means they're less irritating so if you are looking for those benefits of vitamin C but you don't you're not ready for that pure ascorbic acid which it straight up stings when I use it a lot of times um that's when I go in with one like this so another favorite this one is also a vitamin C derivative it's called it's Coco kind's vitamin C glow serum and I like this one because it is a derivative as well but it has the next ingredient which I'm going to go over which is azelaic acid so this one is kind of like a twoin one if you're looking to get both of those benefits I would recommend this guy but AIC acid you've probably seen it I've tried many different formulations it is something that they actually will prescribe if you go to a dermatologist they will give you aoic acid for rosacea now prescription strength is 15% so you have to go to a dermatologist to get that usually so a lot of times you'll find it in 10% but it can it can still be beneficial the cool thing about azoic acid is it is a really good like gentle exfoliant at the same time you get it with some of these things all in one so like this is a vitamin C derivative with AIC acid in it this one from nutum is uh also has a vitamin C in it um so it helps it says congestion redness dullness and discoloration it is a very multi-purpose product but it also balances bacteria redness inflammation that mild exfoliant will help Target those bumps and enlarged pores that we sometimes get here from Rosia um and it will smooth the skin because of that exfoliant properties so this one is one of the most high-end ones I've ever used it's an amazing formulation it's called Ando It Is by Anisa and it's a 10% um AIC and the PHA serum so it's got added PHA in it it feels amazing so one of the bad things about aoic acid is it can be a little bit trickier for chemist to formulate with and so a lot of times it can be um an ingredient that leads to pilling when you layer it with other products um once you put your sunscreen on it can peel underneath um this one does not it is amazing formula and this one is becoming one of my favorites it's one of the best formulations I've ever seen I don't know how they somehow got a 15% as a like in this one so this is theramed it also has codal oatmeal which oatmeal colloidal oatmeal is one of the best for soothing redness this is it's not a serum it's more of like a lotion um almost like a moisturizer type situation I don't know how but it's one of the best some of the other formulations of AIC acid might be a little gritty um this is a serum again it's a little bit lowerer percentage but so if rosacea is like what you're looking to control I would add an aoic acid in your reg now I almost didn't like mention the next one because let's be honest it's in everything like here you go niacinamide this one's AAL acid niacinamide vitamin C okay this has got all three niacinamide we all know it's an anti-inflammatory antioxidant repairs the Skin Barrier it's in probably 90% of your product so do you need an additional niacinamide most likely no just read your ingredient labels um but it is really good for just kind of all over strengthening now it can be in in some things too high of a percentage so if you can look at the percentage like you don't need 10% that could be very irritating for rosacea skin look for more like 2 to 5% now if it is like in something like this it's not probably at a high percentage because it is a combination product but if you have a separate niacinamide product you don't need a 10% couple of bonus serums just because I feel like they're so good um here's another beauty of Jos one this one is a calming serum this is one of the ones I've been testing but it is green tea and panol which are two of the best calming type serums I like this one because I can easily kind of put it under other ones if I need a little bit more like if I'm feeling a little flushed already like my cheeks are feeling warm that morning I'll grab something like this to like instantly calm green tea aloe panol all of those are really good for that redness and inflammation just an all encompassing kind of soothing serum great for strengthening your barrier if you don't have a barrier serum in Your Arsenal I would recommend this one and it's really fun so this is the hot pink ordinary um soothing and barrier support serum this is pretty much got everything that we've been talking about in it even more lipids vitamins like things that will repair your barrier if it gets inflamed which if you have rosacea you naturally going to have a more sensitive barrier so having something like this is really going to help you out and then we've got a new launch um at least it's only been out for a couple weeks I think it came out when I was in Mexico and I it's really good of course it's good it's from prequel and it's made for redness um I knew as soon as I saw the launch I was like I have to have that so this is the redness reform soothing serum so many of the ingredients I've already talked about arnica oat glycerin aloe beta glucan um it's literally meant for restoring a bearer and reducing redness I love the formulation because it's this I I don't know what it is give me milky toners and really like soothing serums that are like gel like they instantly kind of absorb you instantly get that cooling factor and I feel like as somebody with kind of Flushed hot skin the cooling this is so good so I'm still testing this cuz it hasn't been out for long but when it comes to talking about rosace it most definitely would be a serum I'd recommend trying okay and then real quick if we're talking like nighttime regimens we've got our soothing serums what if we still want to incorporate a retinoid product if you have never used a retinoid before I would recommend starting off with a really low dose because like I said um retinol is shown to reduce inflammation in the skin and so something like this Co Coco kinds this is their beginner retinol gel now it's a little um misleading because it says it's a. 1% but it's a tri retinoid complex because it has um both retinol a Time released retinal and a grand active retinoid so it's got three different kinds very low percentages um but what I love about it is that it also has aloe and cintella so it's going to kind of calm at the same time so if you are a rosacea person and you want to use a retinoid this is by far the best formulated it's not going to irritate your skin because it's like so low it's still going to show results over time and when it comes to retinoid low and slow don't like starting off too high is only going to cause irritation and make your skin go backwards and it's going to cause inflammation and your redness is going to come out so low and slow this is the one I would choose now if you're like okay Sarah I've used a really low one for a really long time my rosace is under control I have a really strong barrier that's when I would say move up to a retinal um the M love has a retinal the Moonlight serum um this beautiful yellow bright yellow serum and then I'd say if you want the best results and you're like not not ready for Tre you guys I'll be honest I don't know if I'll ever be able to use TR Nan again I've tried it before my rosacea skin does not like it and that's okay and I'm totally okay with that because I'm still going to get results from using a retin alahh they're my favorite so the crystal retinals line from medicate I like because it's got a lot of different dosages and you can start really slow I'm at the 10 level right now um you I I believe it's is it like one three six 10 I can't even remember all the numbers but once you go through a bottle you'll be able to move up to the next one and so it kind of forces you to go low and slow and like not jump too quickly to the next and immediately have that irritation that we all know retinoids will give you moisturizers I feel like a lot of times you just have to pick something that works for your skin type if you're already focusing on all of these great ingredients focus on glycerin and ceramides um and you'll be good for sensitive skin those are always the best so for daytime I like this Vana cream it's simple it's loaded in ceramides and hyaluronic acid it is free of so many things that can cause irritation and it's made for sensitive skin and it's silicone free for under Saint so this would be my choice I also really love the snail cream again we love the snail mucin it is so good for kind of just calming irritation and keeping that barrier intact and then what helped my skin originally was just the saint cream um something about the milk I think is what really calmed my skin honey a very low do retinoid cuz it's got retinal palmitate which is a derivative very low dose um honey petrolatum because it is is that petrum base it kind of holds in that moisture and it is really good for barrier repair so this will always be my r or Dye um but I'd say if you want something else that is just really good for barrier lots of free fatty acids and um ceramides I would definitely say instant Angel by do is also one of my holy Grails just an all-encompassing really really good moisturizer free of anything that's going to cause you any irrit which is always good and then last but not least I'm going to share some mineral sunscreens for those of you who maybe are still in that sensitive part can't use chemical filters or organic filters and need an inorganic so prequel has one now it's really good um it's kind of got like a pink undertone um it is a zinc oxide you see that but I love it because it really like gives you a nice glowy finish um and it does go in with no white cast which is what's so hard to find when it comes to Mineral um and so it also has uh I can never say this word visol which is um a good soothing ingredient also for red skin I really like this um for a mineral sunscreen this on no makeup days because it does have a silicone in it but these are my two favorite mineral choices that are silicone free so the Coco kind daily SPF this one takes a little bit longer to rub in it's got a little bit more of a white cast um and then the dream Beam by kosas um it has a lot of great soothing ingredients as well cuz it's got peptides ceramides hyaluronic acid allantoin but this one does pill if you put too much skin care under it so just know that um at least it pills on me if I layer it with too much so I would say stick to really like thin watery textures maybe only one serum um for mornings if you're using this honorable mention is always going to be some kind of um treatment and caast which is based off cantella asiatica um this is a dimethicone skin protectant it's got shea butter again cantella vitamin B5 this would be like something I would say your barriers inflamed this is kind of like a Holy Grail status at this point um cult favorite at night after all your skin care just putting like a psize amount all over is kind of like to lock it all in and heal your barrier overnight it's so good so this will really reduce redness for a rosacea Seer all right I think I covered all the Skin Care let's talk makeup really quick now you guys see me put on my makeup all the time I always use 3D Foundation when it comes to my color corrector but I'm always asked about and redness okay so if you don't know the difference I've got lots of videos I can share down below my two cents when it comes to redness if you have rosaceous if you have a type of redness you know fluctuates if somebody tells me on their color match form that they have a red they have rosacea I will not recommend Demi for rosacea and here's why Demi is a precise application you don't want to take something for redness which is usually in the yellow orange category across a large area you would have to pinpoint with a precise brush and actually kind of color correct every single one of those little broken capillaries and yes it works but it's timec consuming you can't just take a big fluffy brush and put it across your face without it showing texture you'll see the texture you'll see where it won't lay nicely on your skin and that's because you're also touching that color to not your broken capillaries if that makes sense so also Demi is not really for beginners it is um a little bit harder to learn you have to be willing to master it as well and if your redness fluctuates here's what I found if you put this on an area of your face and then say later in the day you go outside and it flushes and gets brighter guess what if you color corrected it to that level cuz you have to choose how deep it is based on what it is at that moment if when it fluctuates it no longer will be covered it comes right back out and so this is why when you tell me of rosacea I will pick a corrector that I know will work even as your redness fluctuates during the day okay and so this is why I use magic mango I probably always will because I know it's got me covered depending on how dark my redness gets if it's light or if it gets inflamed it's going to color correct it if you have rosace you don't have a color corrector I will link my color match uh questionnaire down below I can definitely help you I have matched many people like me that's got redness problem I'm telling you it's a game Cher once you get a corrector that works now I wanted to kind of experiment real quick and show you guys one of my newest discoveries for redness now I will be honest I haven't tried this under makeup yet but I've seen someone use it under makeup I think I even checked it it doesn't have I checked no silicon it actually is like classified as like a skin care corrector it has glycerin niacinamide but the main ingredient is niacinamide at 2% and it Hasen seaweed extract which makes it this green color and I'll be honest I didn't know if it was really going to work I'm going to show you what it does so this is going to this is my new go-to for no makeup day so I have no makeup on right now sometimes it bothers me how like red my chin just my chin gets and like my broken capillaries right here and a little bit on my cheeks and the first time I tried this I was flored because I typically think of like a green color corrector like Demi and if I try to use Demi in this way it does not look pretty it doesn't sit well it looks like it's just sitting in my pores and shows all the texture but let me just show you this is just like green skin care right so I'm just going to take a fluffy brush now if you over apply you'll see the green but if you keep it light-handed look at that can you tell how I was like floored it's by typology I will link it down below so I and and this is like my my problem area right here like broken capillaries and I was like oh this is definitely going to show texture right because that is an area of my face it's just an area of everyone's face that shows so much texture and I'm just amazed at how well this sits on skin and it doesn't look like makeup I probably should have like not dotted on the other side it doesn't look like it doesn't look like anything is on your skin because it's classified as like not makeup it's classified as a corrector and let me tell you no makeup days now I have noticed if I widely fluctuate like on one of those days I'm telling you like my redness oh doesn't help when I have a coughing fit and my full face just turned red again oh man but besides that this does an amazing job and it doesn't take much at all and I've used my fingers too it says you can press on with fingers I kind of like the blending ability of the brush actually better with it so far I don't know if you guys can tell a difference but I certainly can so a few times I've used this and then done a little bit of Demi under my eyes and to me that was a game changer because Demi was always too timec consuming to get rid of my redness so if I was just using Demi I could get rid of like my dark spot and like around my eyes and a little bit around my nose but it would always give me texture issues here and there's no texture with this product really good I'm high impressed so t33 by typology and I'm also just have to say this company is made in France I don't know where their warehouse is though like I always order and get stuff within a day or two it's like Amazon fast which just makes me want to order from them more because I hate shipping times right so it kind of reminds me of if you've heard of Dr jart has a seea Paar line which is like kind of green tinged and it's like skin care that is color correcting at the same time but I've checked in like literally every single product from them I've wanted to try it all has a lot of silicone in it and this one didn't have any so I was like sold I have to try it and I am so impressed I'm so impressed so okay that's all I got my redness has improved so much over the last few years of just kind of learning what skin care to use and how to take care of my skin like this is what I looked like before my rosacea started coming out at like 34 6 7 years later I feel like all right I know what to look for I know what ingredients and that's what I want to teach you guys what ingredients do you need to look for in order to kind of control it because it is something that takes consistency you can't just use these products once rosacea there's no cure but it can be alleviated you can control the symptoms um and they don't have to show them on your face right and I'm also not saying I use all of these products every single day a lot of these are Staples in my routine um when My Skin Barrier is not feeling very resilient I reduce my actives and really increase my barrier repair calming soothing type products and then pay attention to your skin and you really get to know it you will know when to kind of add back in those activ and kind of pull these back until your skin needs it always trying to keep a healthy barrier you will be good and your redness will be controlled that doesn't mean the Heat and all those lifestyle triggers we talked about aren't going to still happen but when they occur you know which skin care to reach for as always I will link up everything I talked about down below the video if you have any questions on rosacea or skincare ingredients just let me know down in the comments below if you're needing a color match for 3D that link will also be down below and I will put it in the pin comment as always thank you guys so much for being here and watching love you bye",

        "transcript": "good morning my little nerds i am dr shireen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city welcome to my youtube channel please feel free to like subscribe and comment below i definitely try to read through all the comments on saturday and sunday once the video is published and hopefully i will get to your comment question request in the next video so today i decided to tackle this a little bit differently and focus on sensitive skin maybe because i'm feeling a little sensitive these days going through construction on an office sucks and there's no better way to put it and i find myself tearing up or crying at a drop of a pin so i thought i would empathize with all my sensitive soul skin people out there and do a video just for you so in this video we're going to cover the basics as to what is sensitive skin what to look out for and a couple of my favorite products on the market in each category that would be best geared and suited for you so sensitive skin the way i look at patients who come in with sensitive skin is the way i felt when i was pregnant walking into a very fancy restaurant or a sushi restaurant where everything was there at my disposal but i was not allowed to eat it and i feel for people with sensitive skin because they probably walk into a walmart ulta sephora target and basically see all the skin care and feel very limited and trapped because they're too scared to approach any of them so i see you and i feel for you because it sucks people with sensitive skin tend to experience redness inflammation dryness stinging burning itching and even acne breakouts pretty much everything and the reason why they tend to react so much more profoundly is because their skin barrier is not as strong and as intact as somebody with quote unquote normal skin or even oily skin and so they need to approach any new product that they put on their face very gingerly very cautiously and really allow themselves the time to see if that product works for them and really gets to see how their skin responds and that's why i always say get to know your skin before you decide to jump in and incorporate 20 new skin care products in your skincare routine overnight because your skin will freak the f out it will go all right it just will not work i also want to say that oftentimes i find it amusing when i'm reading skin care product reviews online whether it's sephora or alta or target or whatever and i he and i read this product made my skin get really really red and inflamed it sucked i'm sorry to break it to you but maybe the product didn't suck it just sucked for you it's one of those it's not me it's you or it's not you it's me situations the product itself is what it is but if you're somebody who's very sensitive maybe it sucked for you that's just something to keep in mind especially as you are becoming a more well-versed skincare consumer and you're reading these reviews online about products at least this way you're becoming more aware as to what you know you take it with a grain of salt and you kind of see if it applies so what exactly is the difference between sensitive skin versus sensitized skin sensitive skin is as we just described somebody who has you know these sort of propensities to reacting or becoming inflamed or red or breaking out or whatever it is to various different ingredients that are not specific sensitized skin means you're now reactive to a very specific ingredient because your skin is sensitized to that ingredient so you've developed an allergy specifically against this ingredient not everybody with sensitive skin becomes sensitized the likelihood yes is higher but it doesn't mean that you're going to become all of a sudden sensitized to all fragrances and that's why i always laugh at how everybody exes out fragrances obviously if you have sensitive skin probably avoid but somebody like myself has normal skin doesn't need to avoid fragrance but that is the difference between sensitive and sensitized and once you're sensitized in a very twisted way it's almost kind of like a blessing very twisted way because now you know that you need to avoid that one ingredient and you know just never to use it so you can then look out for products that doesn't contain it and how to discover if you actually have sensitized skin it's by going to an allergist or a dermatologist and getting patch tested not prick tested patch tested where they put patches to see if your skin has developed an allergic reaction to an allergen what are the common and i'm going to say one two three let's keep going four ish five ish things to look for or to try to avoid if you have baseline sensitive skin and i'm going to lead this with what i just talked about fragrance i think it's important to try to minimize your risk of becoming sensitized to different ingredients fragrances can cause a lot of reactions and if you're somebody who's super super sensitive you probably want to look for something without fragrance the caveat is fragrance can be masked as anything it's not like you look at the ingredient list and it's written fragrance you know like even lolita there's no ingredient list printed on this it's not brilliant fragrance it could be masked as essential oils which obviously contain fragrances there's an ingredient called balsam of peru which is a very very famous fragrance that is put in a lot of skincare products there is also perfume or i don't know how you perfume parfait whatever that is basically another word for fragrance because it's usually a proprietary concoction of different scents so you're not necessarily going to find fragrance in the ingredient list so you have to know what you're looking out for number two alcohol alcohol is a really bad rep and it doesn't deserve it there's different types of alcohols there's denatured alcohols okay and those are basically alcohol denate or what's it called sd but those are not fatty alcohols the reason i say avoid those types of denatured alcohols is because you're trying to put chances on your side it's kind of like with fragrances alcohols are used in formulations to enhance penetrations of other actives it can be a little bit stripping and drying and so if you have a compromised skincare skin barrier you're obviously going to approach a little bit with caution but again i don't want you guys to freak out it's not all alcohols are created equal and one day we're going to do a deep dive into alcohol in another video but that's just something to kind of keep in mind if you're on the extreme end of sensitive skin third foaming washes things with sodium lauryl sulfate and i it's a i'm getting a lisp sls but those are things you also want to avoid because those can be over stripping like i said causing a compromised skin barrier making your sensitivities worse and finally tingling agents any kind of cream that you see that says cooling sensation probably has menthol peppermint in it and those can be very very very um reactive to your skin you can kind of do a small test by looking at your toothpaste if you're somebody has super sensitive skin when you brush your teeth with any kind of mint toothpaste you can see if you know you're developing sort of reactions around your mouth that can be kind of a like a very easy poor man's test to see if you're reactive to it and last if you are a super nerd and if you have the time to look into the ph of certain formulations you want to avoid cleansers with very very high ph because that can be over stripping and again compromise your skin barrier so how do we know then which products you want to incorporate in our routine i think it's pretty simple approach with caution test a small area in front of your ear out or even right here underneath your ear do that every day for a week to see how your skin responds because it's not necessarily going to respond with the first go-around and then see how you like the product and if it works and you're okay use it all over your face but do that for at least one to two weeks before incorporating something new it's tedious it's time consuming it's emotionally draining i am not disagreeing with you but your skin will thank you in the long run all right now claims what are the claims we want to look for when we are trying to find products with sensitive skin you want to see things that are formulated for sensitive skin like this product right here i can never do this by vanity cream all right so number two you want to look for fragrance free claims not unscented unscented like certain soap bars actually has a chemical in there that masks the scent so you don't look for unscented it is not the same as fragrance free there are two separate claims they are not the same so you want to look for fragrance free a third little tidbit if you see this label by the eczema association it's probably something that's better suited for you as well four you want to look for things that are hypoallergenic sort of like your comforter for your bed think of it as comforter for your face hypoallergenic is always going to be better and five anti-redness products cannot claim to calm inflammation otherwise it'd be considered like drugs and it has to have a drug claim on them so a lot of skin care products over the counter use words like soothing calming redness reducing anti-redness as code word for sensitive skin so that's just something for you guys to think of and to look out for and so you just need to make sure that you are really reading between those lines let's jump in quickly to some of my favorite roundups of products starting with cleansers i love this guy i never ever ever not bring vana cream up i think it is a great cleanser for sensitive skin it is free of pretty much everything masking fragrance like we talked about for unscented lanolin which is a wool alcohol found in aquaphor not vaseline um i don't care about the parabens but parabens fine other preservatives dyes formaldehyde etc it is really really gentle almost too gentle if you're somebody who wears heavy makeup you're definitely going to need to load up on another step for a double cleanse because it's not going to be enough which leads me to this the bioderma micellar water this is the sense bio h2o i like this one a lot because it is formulated for sensitive skin it does not contain fragrance whereas a lot of other french products do and i think that it is extremely extremely um it's hypoallergenic and it is extremely gentle so the combination of this and this does the job if you're wearing as much makeup as like i am currently which is a very light under eye concealer um i put a little bit of powder on my eyes eyebrow pen eyeliner and mascara so this these two are actually great for a light makeup day all right and then third everybody talks about you know cerave's hydrating cleanser it's nice because it's ceramide infused and you definitely want to use ceramides to help to restore your skin barrier moving on to serums i love a good hydrating serum but most of them on the market contain hyaluronic acid if you have sensitive skin i would strongly urge that you watch my ha video and try to cut it out code words for hyaluronic acid in the ingredient list are sodium hyaluronate and a nice alternative is this one by aveeno i've been speaking about this one a lot it is the calm and restore triple o serum it is extremely calming and soothing especially if you have eczema and it is really nicely geared towards sensitive skin so if you're looking for a hydrating serum i would strongly urge that you guys look into this one the one downfall is this dropper socks it is probably one of the worst droppers i've ever used on the market you guys can flip it out for a pump head um i've posted a video on it on tiktok one day i'll do a video here for you guys a second serum i really like is dr jart's sick appear serum the reason i like this one and i haven't opened this particular bottle i just bought this is because it has sentella asiatica and sentella is a great ingredient as i'm struggling to open this where are my scissors i don't have scissors so sentella is a great ingredient to help reduce redness it cannot say that it treats redness or it's anti-inflammatory but know that it is it isn't the same similar style dropper as the aveeno but i will say the quality of this dropper is you know you cannot compare it to the dropper of the aveeno one it is light green in color which helps to counteract the redness that usually is appearance with sensitive skin or rosacea but i love this serum i think it is beautiful it definitely helps to repair and soothe dry skin especially sensitive skin and it is one that i recommend quite often to my own patients so that is sick a pair moving on to exfoliants i think exfoliants have gone a little bit wild i love a good chemical exfoliant but a lot of patients and people in general are now overdoing it and really compromising their skin barrier so you want to go with something where less is more lactic acid is a very gentle chemical acid stones by sunday riley it is not going to be one of those massive powerhouses but it's very gentle and it's going to help you lightly buff your skin so this one's a nice one and then usually i would say be careful with salicylic acid as it can be drying but i found this one by first aid beauty which is two percent salicylic acid safe for sensitive skin which they claim on here i personally have not used it but it is something out there if you are acne prone to sensitive skin you might want to look into these um first aid beauty two percent salicylic acid um treatment pads they're just something to kind of think about all right and finally moisturizers you want to think of your skin as a broken baby's butt okay and you just want to cocoon your skin you want to cocoon it you want to restore your skin barrier you want to treat it like it is a sculpture on the verge of breaking and so moisturizers are going to be the best thing for you and so i have a bunch so starting with again dr jart has this ceramide cream this one is infused with ceramides it's great for super dry skin it's also great for sensitive skin like we talked about it comes in a nice um tube metallized tube and it is a good and really thick cream again not for somebody with super oily skin somebody with really dry slash sensitive skin this might just be enough for you again if you're super sensitive though i would be careful because it's not necessarily the quote unquote purest of products out there as it has other ingredients as well including a scent okay for example it has citrus in it so just beware but it is going to help if you're super dry and you need your barrier repaired if you're worried about any sort of scent your best bet is plain old vaseline this is probably the cheapest and the fastest way you're going to fix your face or your skin if you have super sensitive skin where your barrier is compromised it's literally just petroleum jelly in it and there's no lanolin whereas for example aquaphor contains lanolin so this is something i think you guys should look into and not be scared to test out on your face if your skin is extremely sensitive broken dry trapped irritated flaky stingy etc you might want to do this for a week see how your face responds to it and then decide if you hate it or if it actually saved your face just saying so number three is the sequel fat cream you guys can find this at your local drugstore it's by aven and then i've spoken about this i love the sycoplast balm b5 by la roche posay it's a very thick and chewy cream it is really really like it just cocoons everything it is not for somebody who you're gonna have to really get it in there it does have a little bit of zinc in it which causes that white cast but that can also be inflammatory reducing so just something to kind of think about if your skin is extremely sensitive and just not in a good spot and if you want to treat yourself a really nice one for winter coming up is skinceuticals triple lipid this one is loaded in ceramides and it's going to help to restore your skin's barrier and finally a sunscreen a very easy sunscreen that you guys can use a sensitive skin that's not going to kill your face in the process it's going to not only help protect and soothe it cetaphil they have this daily facial moisturizer with spf 20 which is honestly too light but it's something to start with if you are somebody who cannot approach any sort of sunscreen in the u.s at least without getting some sort of reaction it is with titanium dioxide and zinc dioxide so it is a um mineral based sunscreen it does come with a tint all right not necessarily the best of tints for everyone myself included but again if you're somebody who's super sensitive and you just want to try to get some sort of protection in and you don't walk a lot outside during the day or don't work by a window you can at least try to start incorporating this sort of sunscreen in your daily routine so those are some of my favorite products in a nutshell i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you sensitive souls out there can now sort of walk through a beauty aisle with a little bit more confidence and i hope this video was helpful i will catch you guys next week have a great weekend [Music] you",

        "transcript": "hey everybody welcome back to my channel and welcome if you're new my name is haley i'm so sorry for how long it's been since i've posted my life has literally been psycho this semester but texas is currently actually going through like a winter apocalypse apparently so that has made things come to a halt here and i've been able to like catch up on things it's so snowy like i i've i don't know today i'm so excited i'm gonna be talking about my skincare routine and how i went from this literally looking like i had a sunglass sunburn all the time like literally to this and feeling confident enough to not have to wear makeup and just kind of let my skin breathe on its own and not have to worry about redness and hyperpigmentation all the time before we jump in to what we're doing obviously i am not a professional i'm not a doctor i'm not an esthetician i'm not a pa or np or anything like that though i am eventually gonna get there i think we'll see consult your doctor or whoever you see about your skin before you you know delve into some of these things what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna break down the three key ingredients that i use that are just so essential in my opinion for helping fight and reduce long-term redness and then i will go over like kind of my routine as a whole incorporating those ingredients so what saved my skin retinol okay you basically a vitamin a derivative and it comes in many forms you can get in like creams serums whatever and it comes in different percentages so anywhere ranging between like point two five percent to one percent which sounds really small but one percent retinol in a cream is actually pretty intense so retinol is an amazing ingredient it helps to reduce fine lines brighten your skin and minimize breakouts so it does this by actually stimulating your cells like your top layer of cells on your skin to basically turn over faster and so basically just stimulates new cell growth that kind of makes sense if you think about like hyperpigmentation like let's say you had a zit and it goes away but you still have a dark mark well that dark mark will be there until those skin cells have like shed away to like get rid of that dark mark if that makes sense and so retinol helps facilitate that faster and as a result your skin brightens up and gets rid of that stuff at a faster rate it also helps to boost your collagen production and collagen is basically a protein that kind of makes your skin more like supple bouncy things like that you see like collagen people take it as like a supplement things like that and yeah so those are like the main two mechanisms of retinol retinol is actually a less intense version of a retinoid so retinoid is also a vitamin a derivative but it's actually just a higher percentage so usually it's prescription based only it's more than one percent so anywhere from like two to three percent um and you can get those prescribed to you by a dermatologist retinols on the other hand you get over the counter like at sephora that being said though retinol is still a very intense ingredient and you have to be careful when you're using it so when i first delved into retinol usage i used the sunday riley luna oil and i like the sunday riley luna oil it actually definitely like almost overnight made a change in my skin it is a one percent retinol and it's in like an oil base i personally wanted to switch over to something that wasn't as oily and didn't have as much fragrance just because it felt a little bit heavy on my skin personally but it definitely did make a difference what i use now is the drunk elephant passiony a passiony retinol cream and that is actually also a one percent serum not serum it's more of like a cream but this one you guys is so much more intense with the sunday riley luna oil i used to use it like every single day and i didn't have any adverse effects with the drunk elephant i started like as soon as i got it i just used it every day because i was like oh it's one percent it's the same it's not the same you guys it is much more intense you do get better results in my experience with the drunk elephant rather than the sunday riley however the peeling the peeling i only use the drunk elephant one like two or three times a week at this point because retinol can be really really drying and this version of retinol is just drying that as simple as i can put it it's just really drying so you have to be careful when you're using a retinol whether it's like your first time using a retinol or if you're switching over to a different retinol just always give it like some time and some testing because they can definitely irritate your skin and that being said it's messing with that top layer of your skin right so wear sun screen you guys please wear sunscreen um it's so essential so retinol really makes your skin susceptible to those uv rays from the sun so definitely make sure to put on sunscreen every single day if you're using retinol and just regardless because the sun is not your friend for your skin okay that was the first ingredient that i recommend um retinol so we covered all the bases there okay so the next ingredient that i want to talk to you guys about is hyaluronic acid and hyaluronic acid is like a miracle for moisture and you guys it literally can hold up to a thousand times its weight in water so it is very hydrating it's great for moisture retention in your skin hyaluronic acid can come in serums it can come in creams or it can be you know in your moisturizer or in your cleanser like whatever it may be personally i use hyaluronic acid in my moisturizer so the moisturizer i use at morning and night is the ordinary hyaluronic acid plus natural moisturizing factors moisturizer and i love it it's super nice creamy consistency it's not like one of those like light and airy watery feeling ones i hate those and it's also not like overly thick it's a nice medium it feels really good on your skin it has that hyaluronic acid which is fantastic for moisturizing and the third ingredient that i really recommend for hyperpigmentation redness reducing all that stuff is niacinamide now niacinamide is actually vitamin b3 it's the same idea as niacin sometimes you take niacin as a dietary supplement they're the same thing but in like a different form basically so niacinamide is great because it minimizes your pore size reduces redness and helps to regulate your oil production and it basically does this by increasing your collagen production and reducing inflammation in your skin now if you think about it that kind of makes sense right because if your skin is red that means that it's inflamed your immune system is like oh blood needs to rush to this area and so that's what inflammation is it's just blood rushing to that area sorry that the lighting is so bad it's so bright out i'm like why is this not corresponding to the lighting here so inflammation is what makes your skin look red because all it is is blood rushing to that area and when you have niacinamide i don't know like the exact mechanism but it basically helps reduce inflammation and thus reduce redness so i told you about the ingredients that i love so how do i incorporate this into my routine what exactly is my routine for the morning all i use is moisturizer and sunscreen i don't wash my face in the morning i personally just don't find it necessary it's good to let your you know natural oils do their thing so in the morning i use my ordinary natural i use my ordinary hyaluronic acid and natural moisturizing factors moisturizer and i follow it up with the sunscreen currently i'm using the sunbum face 50. love that stuff and that's all i do sun protection really important at night i first use a cleanser i use the cerave salicylic acid cleanser and i really like this salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid which just means that it's a deeply penetrating acid and helps to penetrate deep into the layers of your skin and reduce and prevent acne now after my cleanser two times a week i go in with a peel of some sort the two that i usually use are either the ordinary aha bha peel or i use the dr dennis gross peel pad both of these are essentially chemical exfoliants that help again to kind of get that top layer of grime that's the easiest way to put it those dead skin cells off and it just results in brighter skin you know good to not overuse this though do not use this stuff like every day i use it literally like twice a week because if you do more than that you're really going to start damaging your skin barrier and making your skin so susceptible to the sun um so after that i followed up with my ordinary niacinamide serum already talked about that and three times a week i use my retinol now i usually if i do i appeal i will not also do a retinol that same night just because that's a lot for your skin all at once so um just keep that in mind and then at the very end of it all i top it off with my moisturizer so that same ordinary hyaluronic acid natural moisturizing factors moisturizer you guys i so greatly apologize for the lighting um it it's very all over the place because the snow but that is my whole routine so i really base it around ingredients and kind of pick products that have those ingredients in them and i have literally seen night and day results in my skin i used to have like insane rosacea and hyperpigmentation it was just like the worst and i don't have that anymore it's really great so this is just kind of like what i do what has helped me and again i'm not a professional so i do best as best i can to like know what's going on and what all this stuff is but obviously i'm not a trained licensed professional so be cautious with yourself be cautious with your skin make sure to always you know give yourself time to like adjust to new products and stuff like that but i do help hope at the end of the day this was helpful and informative and if you did enjoy it i'd really appreciate a thumbs up and subscribe if you'd like to see more and i'll catch you in my next video

surgical and cosmetic dermatology in bellevue and rent in washington i did my residency training at harvard medical school's combined dermatology program did my first year of internship at beth israel deaconess hospital which is a harvard affiliated hospital and then did three years of dermatology training at the other harvard hospitals beth israel brigham and women's mass general hospital as well as boston children so i'm really excited here so i'm really grateful that i have this platform to talk to you guys about some you know skin care products because that's fun and it's always great to take care of your skin especially as we get into some colder weather here in seattle it's definitely a nice topic to talk about facial moisturizers thank you for waiting for this topic to appear on my channel you know another big thing is facial moisturizers that pair well with active ingredients like retinoids retinoid creams retinoid serums the biggest side effect to a retinoid cream would be irritation redness peeling dry peeling on the face especially around the mouth when you first start off with a retinoid that is a very common thing to to that we that's actually something to be expected at times and that's the stronger the retinoid uh like the prescription stuff like tretinoin the more likely you'll see it versus over-the-counter stuff if you're a beginner you can start off with over-the-counter retinol retinol retinol those you might not see irritation as much but you can definitely get irritation with anyone so any type of retinoid or even a dappling 0.1 percent over the counter is still can be very irritating as well for some people so let's jump into it these are the top four moisturizers for the face that work well with retinols or retinoids in general so what is a retinoid a retinoid is a vitamin a derived cream or serum or pill here i talk about topical retinoids which over the counter would be retinil like retinol palmitate retinol which has to be converted to retinaldehyde which is another over-the-counter retinoid and that's stronger than the retinol and then that gets converted further into a prescription retinoic acid to be active and tretinoin is a common thing that i prescribe in my practice that does really well for my patients especially those with acne when you have acne prone skin a retinoid is great at prevention of acne and i always say if your acne is doing well on a retinoid like tretinoin don't stop because when you stop your acne is going to come back and you're back to ground zero and you gotta work your way up again so big mistake is people stop the retinoid too soon when they're doing well they stop it it's a great medicine to use even when you're clear because it helps prevent the name of the game when you're when you have acne is to prevent because once that acne bump is out it's gonna stay there and take its course there are some things that you could do to slow it uh to speed up the recovery but it's so much easier to prevent so moisturizers moisturizers are great to employ with your retinoid to help mitigate or decrease the frequency of irritation and the ones i like to use would be those with niacinamide hydrating ingredients as well like glycerin or hyaluronic acid i like squalane too and my moisturizers as well and so i'll be talking about some with niacinamide which is a vitamin b3 ingredient that's nice for those with acne prone skin because niacinamide helps regulate sebum production and is anti-inflammatory so it's a really nice ingredient for those with acne the first one i'll talk about is ltmd's pm therapy their am therapy also has niacinamide but this is just a nice thing to use in the evening with your retinoid and retinoids i say use at bedtime because a lot of them are unstable in sunlight so pm therapy obviously meant for pm and it says repairs restores elasticity and vitality this is one of my favorites from when i was a resident at harvard and niacinamide is up there on the top towards the top of the ingredient list as well as glycerin and it also has uh sodium hyaluronate and vitamin e as well so let's put this on so it's a nice pump airtight pump very convenient in dispensing your moisturizer just feels great nice clean finish there put on my face blends in so nicely so you can apply your moisturizer before or after or both when it comes to your retinoids so you can do the retinoid sandwich we apply a thin film of this then a pea-sized amount of your retinoid whether it's a over-the-counter retinol [Music] or prescription tretinoin you can apply that over a layer of moisturizer and then if you're really dry you can put another layer of moisturizer over and that's the retinoid sandwich for me i like to just cleanse wait probably an hour do other things and go back put the pea sized amount of my retinoid on and then moisturize with something like this over it just so that i can put the active on and then put a moisturizer to help seal it in and keep it from getting from irritating my skin while i sleep so this is a great option here i'll put a link down below ltmd just great sunscreen brand but they actually make an awesome foaming facial cleanser and then this pm therapy is also so nice it's a cream but also still lightweight doesn't clog up your pores and has niacinamide another one that's more affordable i'd say is ceraves pm facial moisturizing lotion ultra lightweight it has niacinamide hyaluronic acid the three essential ceramides which you guys know by now is ceramides are important in your skin barrier it's part of the glue that keeps the skin cells together this also comes in an am the am is a sunscreen it's a chemical based sunscreen but the pm i think this is just universally a great moisturizer lotion especially in the in the summertime if you want something really lightweight it plays really nice with the things i prescribe in clinic for acne so a lot of dermatologists like this brand a twist top to activate this is brand new so i'm just getting just a small amount out here glides on so nice and cerave is just very gentle on the skin no fragrance put a little bit on the side of my face here oh nice and cooling very lightweight so this one i'd say being more lightweight than the pm so i say this is like perfect for the summertime and great for if you're starting off a retinoid in the summertime and the myth that says you got to stop your retinoid in the summertime because you're going to be more sensitive to the sun that's a myth do not stop your retinoid you don't have to only stop it if you're pregnant or breastfeeding otherwise yes you can get some sensitivity to the sun because you're bringing in new skin but the retinoid trep no one retinol itself does not make you more photosensitive directly it can make you indirectly sensitive because you're bringing in new skin so if you look at the texture between the two here that's the pm lotion from cerave and then that's the la roche posay much thicker much thinner textures there okay moving on so i'm going to be talking about four moisturizing creams so these two with niacinamide now i'm going off to two without niacinamide this one's vana creams daily facial moisturizer banana cream very underrated brand love it has no fragrance dyes parabens lanolin all those things that people worry about and can get sensitive to especially you know fragrance lanolin i don't have any sensitivities of fragrance so i don't mind it but for people with sensitive skin who said i've tried all these moisturizers nothing works or everything irritates me i usually direct them to vanicream great moisturizer this came out i think in the last year and when i used it i knew right away this is great i love it this is just a very solid moisturizer has squalane it has glycerin it has the hyaluronic acid the ceramides also very lightweight too it has a nice plumping effect i feel with the humectants hyaluronic acid glycerin very nice to layer under your sunscreen i just have to say this is going to probably be a favorite for a long time for me this is a nice convenient tube here just flip the cap off flip it back on these are pumps so it just depends on what you prefer this is so affordable you can find this online or your local store just so affordable so i'll have a link down below for this one so thank you vanna cream for that the last but not least this was probably the most pricey one on the list kiehl's ultra facial cream i mentioned this on the today show this one also blows my mind because it's so cooling i mean it just feels like i keep it in the fridge when you put on your skin you're like oh this is soothing cooling if you're feeling irritated from your retinoid this is just going to come in for a rescue water hose to bring the fire down and this has glycerin has squalane and also has this glacial glycoprotein which is really nice so this is a jar so people don't like jars because you worry about germs and dirty fingers go in with the clean with clean hands or you can use a clean spatula or skincare spoon what have you um but go ahead and you know this is a little bit more on the pricey side like i mentioned but a little goes a long way so that's just a little fingertip amount just dab it just dot on my face kind of like a retinoid and then connect the dots [Music] and it's just so great i think it's just like the perfect texture it's not too thin not too thick you can use this all year round i might use this more in the winter time because maybe it is a little bit more on the thicker side so just in general you know the cerave lightweight lotion great for summer this one might be more for the colder weather although this would do fine in the summer because it's cooling as well so it's hot and humid this might work really well in the summertime so yeah i think this is a nice uh spread here they work really well with retinoids and i think the when you start off on the retinoid i would definitely have a moisturizer on hand one that works well for you nothing too strong in terms of scents fragrances you know people talk about like or brands like to mention oh we're chemical free or if they're clean you know watch out for that kind of branding those branding terms i usually i actually get turned off when a brand approaches me and say they're a clean beauty brand you know clean does not mean uh anything to me it actually turns me off and they say oh we're all natural because all natural does not mean all safe so you know there's i see a lot of people who get skin rashes and irritation and allergies to these clean beauty brands with like these botanical ingredients pumped with tons of essential oils and i just say go with the you know i think i see a lot of comments like oh this drugstore it just sits in the skin it doesn't do anything your moisturizer doesn't have to be complicated you don't have to break the bank for your moisturizers the whole point is just to help maintain your skin barrier so that you can keep your active ingredients going like say something i prescribe or just something fun over the counter like a vitamin c serum you want to keep your skin's equilibrium intact as much as possible that skin barrier and so a nice you know inert benign boring moisturizer is fine you know i like vaseline and aquaphor and that's what a lot of celebrities use on their face just for that little glow under their makeup so don't complicate things don't pay so much for your moisturizers and um yeah just be careful of those marketing terms all right guys so i hope this video was helpful and thank you guys uh for supporting the channel please hit the subscribe button please like the video and then i'll see you for the next one okay take care peace [Music] you",

        "transcript": "hi everyone welcome back thank you so much for\u00a0\nwatching this video i hope you all are well and\u00a0\u00a0 staying safe today's video is going to be my\u00a0\nskincare journey i'm going to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 skin condition which i have been suffering from\u00a0\nlast 15 years which is called rojasia i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to divide this video into different categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there

        "transcript": "if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you're probably having a hard time coming with a skincare regimen or finding skincare products that are effective for you well today in this video we're going to discuss rosacea and I'm going to give you over-the-counter skincare that can help stay tuned till the end because I will make a skincare regimen for your rosacea skin type with actual product recommendations so my name is Dr Swati Canon and I'm a board certified dermatologist out here in California thank you so much for watching this video and welcome to my channel what is rosacea rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness flushing sometimes pimple like bumps on your cheeks your nose your chin as well as textural changes of the nose chin and forehead even various triggers can flare or worsen rosacea and some of these common triggers include alcohol spicy foods sun exposure even stress and I know stress can worsen really anything but stress definitely can worsen rosacea as well as certain histamine-rich foods like tomatoes avocados certain skincare products can also rest in rosacea so there are a lot of triggers for rosacea and a lot of people don't really know what their triggers are so I recommend sometimes keeping a diary so you can know like hey I had red wine and now I have redness and flushing and all the rosacea symptoms or I had an avocado toast yesterday and now my rosacea is worse so keeping a diary can help with noticing what your triggers are but you know it is annoying to keep a diary so I get it rosacea can also affect really any ethnicity and any gender but it is more common in middle-aged Caucasian men and women unfortunately rosacea is chronic like a lot of our inflammatory conditions and there is no cure there are different types of rosacea so we have categorized them into different subsets the first type is called erythamato telangiotatic rosacea I know I don't know why dermatologists have such long words but this type of rosacea is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels or dilated blood vessels on the skin the second type is called Popular are popular postular rosacea and this is when you get pimple like bumps kind of in the middle of your face often acne and popular puscular rosacea can go together so they can be seen together the third type is called fiberous rosacea and this is when you get a thickening of skin or like a bulbous appearance on your nose and finally there's also ocular rosacea this is rosacea affecting the eyes causing redness tearing itching and sometimes vision problems now these categories are actually kind of fluid and changing there is an overlap between all of these categories so you can have you know erythematode rosacea and popular puscular rosacea so there's a lot of overlap but it just kind of helps to Define and gives us guidelines for treatment this video is going to focus on redness and the pimple form of rosacea and how to calm down the Baseline inflammation in rosacea patients thymus and ocular rosacea there is not really any over-the-counter treatment that helps for that so those require prescription or in-office treatments what are the best in ingredients for rosacea the main thing for rosacea patients is to use anti-inflammatory and hydrating ingredients goal is to have a simple yet effective skin care regimen that decreases the inflammation and doesn't cause irritation so you don't want to overuse skin care products the first ingredient for rosacea that I really love is azolic acid we've talked about azelaic acid a lot on my channel and even in my previous video that gave you ingredients for discoloration as a lake acid is one of them so it is one of the best ingredients for acne for rosacea for skin lightening it is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial meaning that it decreases some of the bacteria that play a role in rosacea over the counter you can find 10 azelic acid and we also give prescription strength which is 15 or 20 percent acetylic acid it's best to use acelic acid at night time most rosacea patients are not going to be able to tolerate a retinoid so you're going to use azelic acid instead the next ingredient for rosacea patients is niacinamide and this is a form of vitamin B3 and again I have talked about it a lot nice and mind is in a lot of skincare products especially in moisturizers it's helpful for redness it is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for hydration it also regulates oil production it reduces the appearance of pores so it's really an overall great ingredient for rosacea patients who also have probably all these other issues I don't recommend using niacinamide above five percent I recommend staying under five percent so notorium has a five percent niacinamide gel that you can try also a lot of moisturizers sunscreens they do have niacinamide so you don't have to use niacinamide separately I actually recommend using niacinamide in a moisturizer or in a sunscreen versus by itself tranexamic acid is the other ingredient for rosacea I definitely have it in my previous video where I talk about how helpful it is for hyperpigmentation and melasma it is also so helpful for rosacea because we now know that txa regulates blood vessel formation excessive blood vessel formation and dilation of blood vessels is what causes the redness and the flushing in rosacea patients and so when we can regulate it we can really minimize the appearance of redness txa is also very gentle so it is very well tolerated by most rosacea patients the one that I like is the notorium tranexamic acid serum this contains five percent tranexamic acid and niacinamide plus kojic acid it's helpful for lightning and for rosacea the next ingredient for rosacea is sodium sulfacedamide plus sulfur so sodium sulfacetamide is an anti-inflammatory skincare ingredient but this is often a prescription and it's really hard to find it over the counter however you can find sulfur soaps over the counter and sulfur is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial and that's kind of how it helps rosacea it is incredibly stinky sulfur smells like rotten eggs so some people just can't tolerate the smell of it but sulfur also helps with acne it helps with dandruff called cyborg dermatitis there's a lot of uses for this ingredient so just to clear up any confusion the first ingredient I talked about was sodium sulfacetamide and this can come as a face wash but it's hard to find it over the counter it's usually a prescription we combine sodium sulfacinamide with sulfur and that combination is very good for rosacea but you can also just find sulfur alone as a soap and this is what's usually found over the counter and sulfur alone has some of these properties that I just talked about the next ingredient for rosacea is using ceramides so ceramides are emollients that I've spoken about in the moisturizer video before and ceramides repair the Skin Barrier and they help to hydrate the skin so for rosacea patients it's incredibly important to maintain your skin barrier to protect that Skin Barrier so that you don't get too much irritation I like products like Ulta MD or CeraVe that make moisturizers and sunscreen with ceramides and niacinamide glycerin is another really great humectant for rosacea patients because glycerin is such a powerful hydrating ingredient so it really draws in that water to help moisturize your skin the next ingredient for rosacea is called acetyl tetrapeptide 40. so remember in my peptide video and I don't know if you guys watched it if you haven't watched watch my peptide video please go check it out but in my peptide video I talked about certain peptides that are anti-inflammatory an acetyl Tetra peptide 40 is an anti-inflammatory peptide that can be very helpful for rosacea it helps to reduce inflammation as well as redness it also helps to maintain the Skin Barrier and to protect the Skin Barrier function there are also other peptides that can be anti-inflammatory in fact Paula's Choice peptide booster has multiple peptides several of which are anti-inflammatory and can be very helpful for redness and rosacea patients by the way if you're enjoying and learning from this video please hit the Thumbs Up Button And subscribe to my channel and please also share this video with others who would find it helpful I am trying to grow my channel in 2023 so I am very grateful to all of you who are watching commenting and interacting with my content another really great rosacea ingredient is called and I'm gonna butcher this Camila Camila sinensis anyway this is green tea leaf extract so green tea leaf extract is really helpful for rosacea green tea as we know is very anti-inflammatory it's a very powerful antioxidant and it is used in skincare sometimes especially for rosacea skin another ingredient that I'm going to butcher is called Santa Nella asiatica definitely can't pronounce that but we're going to continue so Santa Nella asiatica in India we actually have this ingredient as well but we call it go to kala and it has many many benefits I actually remember taking gotu kala when I was little for colds it is a powerful antioxidant it is anti-inflammatory and it also helps a lot for inflammation with rosacea patients so it has become a lot more popular in America and it's become a lot more popular in skincare recently in the last few years so beauty of joseon is a Korean skincare brand that actually has a serum that contains a green tea leaf extract Centinela asiatica and vitamin B5 so it's very calming it's hydrating and it's also fragrance free so for rosacea patients that's like a winner have you guys tried Korean skincare products and Korean sunscreens if so please let me know and comment below I really love how Koreans approach skincare with their hydrating and calming ingredients so I think I'm definitely gonna make a YouTube video about it soon but let me know what Korean skincare products you have tried so that I can also look into them Dr jart psychopair tiger grass serum tiger grass or pear serum this has Centinela asiatica and niacinamide it also has like a greenish tint so you can use it in the morning because the green tip helps to cover redness and then it's anti-inflammatory for the actual rosacea component Dr jart sick a pear stick a player is it sick of pear or a single player crap sometimes like I cannot remember these names but this particular line of product also has a moisturizer with similar ingredients that is very common for rosacea patients so you can either use it in a serum or as a moisturizer burrito Centinela green level safe SPF 50 p8 plus plus this isn't a really great sunscreen by the way for rosacea and acne important patients because it contains Centinela asiatica niacinamide vitamin E is an SPF 50. so I really do like this sunscreen fertilization patients and if you've tried it let me know the other sunscreens I normally like for rosacea patients I tend to like sunscreens with zinc oxide so which is a physical sunscreen and I like physical sunscreens over chemical sunscreens because sometimes chemical sunscreens can worsen or trigger rosacea but there are certain chemical sunscreen formulations that are okay that are more well tolerated and one of them is the Ulta MD UV clear and I recommend this for a lot of different patients but it's a really great sunscreen with SPF 46 it contains niacinamide and it's very well tolerated a La Roche Posay also makes various sunscreens for rosacea patients and these are also pretty well tolerated so not all chemical sunscreens are going to flare your rosacea in general I do prefer physical sunscreens but some chemical formulations are okay by the way let's clear up differences between sensitive skin rosacea and having allergies or rashes to certain skin care products so some sensitive skin that's a broad category of patients that just means that you can't tolerate skin care more readily this includes your rosacea patients but you can also have sensitive skin without having rosacea sensitive skin means you're more likely to get rashes or irritation or acne more easily so it's really a broad category that includes various skin types rosacea is what I just said earlier where you have dilated blood vessels and can be characterized by flushing or pimple like bumps this is different than people who get an allergic or contact dermatitis or a rash from exposure to certain ingredients and skin care products or to even certain metals or to other types of preservatives so the most common example of contact dermatitis is nickel dermatitis and dermatitis by the way just means inflammation of the skin so that's a very non-specific term but nickel dermatitis you might have seen this is when patients or when people get a rash around their belly button because of coming into contact with the nickel and the button and the pants or the jeans so if you you tend to get contact dermatitis a common way to test for this at home is you can apply skincare product on your forearm for one to six weeks and see if you get any rashes or irritation if not you can then try the product on your face now this by the way this test the forearm test doesn't work for rosacea patients so rosacea patients it's very hard to see for skincare products can help you or harm you until you try but for rosacea patients what you can do is just try on the side of your face and see if you if you get a flare what are my ingredients to avoid in rosacea skin salicylic acid is one ingredient to avoid even if you have acne and rosacea so I know we commonly use salicylic acid for acne it is anti-inflammatory but it is also so irritating that we don't really recommend it for rosacea patients and this is a similar concept for benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide also is anti-inflammatory we also use it for acne but I don't always recommend it for rosacea patients because they can be irritating perhaps in low percentages it would be okay we just have other ingredients that we can use so we don't have to use these and this is the same for glycolic acid which is a type of chemical exfoliating acid because it's irritating or it can be irritating I also don't recommend it for rosacea now on the flip side polyhydroxy acids which are like a newer type of exfoliating acid they can be helpful for rosacea because they are less irritating they are more gentle and they can be anti-inflammatory so some rosacea patients can try polyhydroxy acids by the way not everyone needs to exfoliate so your skin naturally exfoliates on its own you don't have to use a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid or polyhydroxy acid to help exfoliate so don't feel the need to do so other ingredients like witch hazel Menthol camphor those all cause tingling that doesn't mean by the way it's working but they're all kind of these tingling irritating ingredients and I don't recommend them for rosacea other astringents or toners that contain alcohol or heavy content of alcohol definitely avoid this if you have rosacea because it can be so drying on the other hand though rose water toner can be helpful because rose water is coming and I actually made this video it talks about at home remedies for skin hair and nails if you're interested you can definitely go check it out fragrance if you see that on the label that could potentially also be irritating for rosacea so I would be mindful about it but by the way when you're looking at fragrance and alcohol you know you have to also see where it is on the ingredient list so if alcohol is like the sixth or seventh ingredient in the ingredient list it's probably gonna be okay and it's not going to dehydrate your skin that much but if it's in the top three ingredients then that means that that skin care product has too much alcohol and could potentially dehydrate your skin so retinoids I mean they are really an anti-aging Powerhouse but they can definitely trigger and flare rosacea so you do have to be careful I don't think retinoids are completely off limits for rosacea patients it really depends on how severe your rosacea is and what your triggers for rosacea are you know you just want to be careful so if you're going to want to use retinoids and you have rosacea you want to start very gentle gentle retinoids and then slowly increase their use as tolerated so to learn how to incorporate retinoids you can actually watch one of my first YouTube videos ever on retinoids and it really kind of teaches you how to incorporate a retinoid slowly into your skincare regimen some good options for retinoids in rosacea patients include this Keels Retinol Serum it's ceramides and peptides so this one contains retinol which is a gentler former for retinoid also and it contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides and peptides so start this one slowly but it is a good option for rosacea patients of course if you see an irritation or you see flaring of your rosacea stop any of these skincare products immediately the other good one for rosacea patients is the ordinary Grand active retinol Emulsion brand active retinol is a much gentler type of retinoid so it's really great for rosacea and sensitive skin types and this one also contains squalene invisible law which are ingredients that help with inflammation and hydration and it doesn't contain the shark squalene but the vegan version of squalene now how would you combine all of these ingredients for a skincare regimen in the morning you can use a gentle cleanser so you can actually use the sulfur wash or a prescription sodium sulfacetamide wash like I talked about earlier or you can just use a gentle cleanser like the La Roche Posay tolerain hydrating gentle cleanser or CeraVe gentle cleanser after you clean your face you can use one of the green tea serums like the beauty of joseon green tea serum or the Dr jarts like a pear serum followed by a moisturizer and then sunscreen on top so your moisturizer recommendations include like the Dr jarts like a pear moisturizer or a banana cream moisturizer or a CeraVe moisturizer really anything that's gentle and contains ceramides is a good moisturizer for rosacea patients and you would then follow this up by a sunscreen like the Alta MD UV clear sunscreen which also contains ceramides and niacinamide at night time you can again clean your your face and make sure you use a gentle cleanser to wash off even the makeup of your face you can then use a gentle retinoid like the Kiehl's Retinol Serum or you can use acelaic acid at night time so if you're going to use salicylic acid you can actually use it every single night as long as you don't get irritation but if you want to start a retinoid then you can use a retinoid twice a week and use azelic acid on the other night you would then follow this up with a moisturizer as well and some good moisturizer for rosacea patients include Ulta mdpm therapy or that Dr jart sickle player moisturizer that I talked about earlier on a side note if you do wear makeup and heavily tinted sunscreens and you have rosacea I still recommend that you double cleanse so you can watch this video on double cleansing to learn how to do it well for rosacea patients I don't want you to use any cleansers that strip the moisture off your face so to remove the makeup I recommend the cleansing bombs like the pharmacy Green Clean cleansing balm which is very hydrating and then you would follow the cleansing balm with a gentle cleanser an alternate skin care regimen would be this so in the morning you would cleanse like I talked about above you can then use a vitamin C serum and we'll talk about that soon followed by a moisturizer and then Alta you know the Alta MD sunscreen at night time again you can double cleanse use your azelaic acid and then a niacinamide moisturizer so as you notice I did mention vitamin C even if you have rosacea and vitamin C can really help with rosacea because it is anti-inflammatory and so it can help with some of the flares that rosacea patients have however certain forms of vitamin C and high concentrations of vitamin C can also flare rosacea so if you want to learn how to use vitamin C and you have rosacea make sure to check out this video that I have on vitamin C where I give vitamin C recommendations for rosacea patients and you can learn how to use it in your skincare regimen so thank you so much for

        "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to my channel or welcome if you're new here for today's video i'm going to be sharing my top five all-time favorite holy grail facial moisturizers so these are moisturizers that i've been able to consistently rely on they're fragrance and essential oil free they don't irritate my skin they don't cause me to break out i have very sensitive acne prone skin so if you have concerns in either of those departments i have you covered in both areas and i would say have a really nice variety of formulas depending on your skin type because lucky for you guys i have combo skin so sometimes i'm leaning a lot more oily i want something lighter weight or just lighter weight for the daytime or other times my skin's feeling a little bit drier and tighter i have some dehydration going on maybe some flakiness and i want a nice creamier formula or for nighttime so no matter what skin type you have hopefully there will be something in this video that is a perfect match for you so before we jump into it please don't forget to give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel if you haven't already click on that notification bell and drop a comment below letting me know what your current favorite moisturizer is thank you so much for doing all those things it really helps me out with the youtube algorithm so i appreciate you so so much for doing that and if you need anything for me at all it's always listed in my description box below including lightroom preset filters for editing your instagram photos my spf merch discount codes links to all the products that i'll be talking about here today and time stamps for each moisturizer in this video alright without further ado let's jump into it all right the first moisturizer is from cetaphil i will just say quickly that this is not necessarily a ranked video so this isn't my number one pick out of all five it really just depends on how my skin is acting up if i'm looking for a creamier lighter weight formula so just wanted to make sure i was clarifying that they are all equally amazing just depends on what kind of mood my skin is in so this is the redness relieving night moisturizer for redness prone skin it says it moisturizes to help to soothe the irritation and redness due to dry skin it's fragrance free it's non-comedogenic and this is one of the loves of my life hands down this is one of the best drugstore moisturizers i have ever tried and i'm shocked every time that i use it that it's so affordable because not only is the formula great but the ingredients are so so nice there's tons of hydrating ingredients things that will replenish the skin calmer soothers it's just i mean it is a sensitive skin girl or gals dream so some of those ingredients that will help to hydrate the skin include glycerin sorbitol hyaluronic acid and a ceramide this has softening ingredients like sunflower seed oil and shea butter and then as far as calmer soup there's things that are going to help to relieve redness this has a ton of ingredients in that category including a lantern licorice root which also helps to brighten the skin this has panthenol caffeine and niacinamide what i get carried away every time that i talk about this but i feel like the fact that it's from cetaphil makes me even more excited because i feel like as a brand i mean they have recently stepped it up but before they started to reformulate and come out with new products so many of their products were just really really bare bones and while that can be awesome if you're having skin issues going on extreme sensitivity for everyday use when i'm not having like hyper sensitive skin something like this oh gosh it just you can't beat it so this formula is so so nice this is actually my perfect kind of nighttime formula for a moisturizer because it is on the creamier side but it still is i would say relatively lightweight for a cream so it just is incredibly nice and soft it feels so moisturizing on the skin it works to moisturize my skin all night long i wake up with my skin feeling really nice and replenished but it is something that i think is still lightweight enough to wear during the day so if you like a little bit of a creamier formula like this for daytime you have drier skin this will be perfect otherwise if you're oily great nighttime options so oh my gosh i love it so much i cannot recommend it enough my next favorite is actually another cetaphil option this is one of their newer launches it's their deep hydration healthy glow daily cream i talked about this in a recent video where i shared drugstore gems that feel high-end so if you haven't seen that yet i will list that below but this was one that i had to include there because it truly it feels expensive and it's obviously not this actually has a lot of the same ingredient highlights as that redness relief night cream not quite as many but several that are really really nice so as far as hydrators this has different forms of sugar molecules along with hyaluronic acid it has shea oil and squalene which are really nice softening smoothing ingredients and then for calming soothing ingredients this also has panthenol and niacinamide i did point this out when i last mentioned this moisturizer in a video but i want to make sure i'm just including it here in case you haven't seen that yet this does have one ingredient in it that could potentially be irritating to the skin the reason that i say that is that i couldn't find any research on it so it's called blue daisy extract there are certain plant extracts that can definitely be irritating and sensitizing others that are not so just be aware of that but that's the only thing in here it doesn't irritate my skin at all but i wanted to make sure i was given that a quick call out so while i think the ingredients are great the number one reason why i'm including this in my top five is because of the formula it is so so nice and it's definitely elevated there's a lot of different moisturizing creams from the drugstore that just fall flat for me they just they feel cheap you know what i'm talking about this is nothing like that it is beautiful it honestly kind of reminds me a little bit of the it cosmetics confidence in a cream moisturizer did i just maybe find a dupe i'm gonna have to get back to you on that one but it really does remind me of it because of how nice and freaking soft and cushy it is i've said this before it makes no sense but i'm going to say it again it just kind of has that like pillowy nist to it where it feels like you're putting pillows or clouds on your skin i know it doesn't make sense but that's how i think of this because it's just so nice so i would say it definitely is thicker than that redness relief night cream so kind of same type of thing there i personally really enjoy using this at night but if you have dry skin could be a great day time option oh my goodness she is good next up is another one of the loves of my life this is my favorite lighter weight moisturizer it's the vanna cream daily facial moisturizer and this has a lot of the same replenishing and hydrating ingredients as cereview moisturizers so specifically their daily moisturizing lotion i feel like there's a lot of overlap here but i prefer this formula for sure so this is hyaluronic acid ceramides leftosin and squalane all of which are going to hydrate soften smooth replenish the skin and protect the skin barrier and this is definitely the lightest weight formula i absolutely love this this is what i wore basically every single day over the summer because it's just so nice and lightweight but not so much to where you feel like your skin is starting to feel a little dehydrated or like it needs some extra moisture throughout the day keeps me moisturized all day long it dries down really well so it works perfectly underneath makeup doesn't have any sort of greasy shiny finish but it's also not like flat or mattifying on the skin it's just perfect for a lightweight option if you have dry skin definitely won't be for you but you could layer this underneath a thicker moisturizing cream if those ingredients sound nice to you and the one that you have doesn't have those sort of ingredient highlights otherwise i would say stick to this if you have oily skin and i have a lot of other options for dry so vanicrine daily facial moisturizer i cannot live without this second to last is definitely the most unique formula i have out of all five of these moisturizers and that's because it is primarily made up of snail mucin so this is the cosrx advanced snail 92 all-in-one cream it has 92 percent snail mucin or snail secretion filtrate in it which is an incredible ingredient it helps to strengthen and protect the skin helps to promote wound healing it has calming and soothing properties it is so so nice but on top of that there are other ingredients in this that help to do that same thing and i would just say all around makes this an even more impressive product so one of those ingredients is called adenosine and that actually has basically all the same benefits as snail mucin so you're just getting more bang for your buck there this also has a lantern and panthenol which again are really really nice calming soothing ingredients for the skin this has all of m1000 it has an amino acid called arginine both of which are really going to help to replenish the skin and of course hyaluronic acid which is a great hydrator so amazing ingredients if you have sensitivity going on it is a very interesting formula if you have never used a snail mucin product it's slimy for sure and i would say that this moisturizer is kind of like a jelly cream if you will so it's definitely lighter weight than both of those cetaphil options not nearly as occlusive or creamy as those so if you have dry skin this by itself will likely not be moisturizing enough for you but what i would recommend doing in that scenario is wearing it underneath a thicker moisturizing cream you will wake up the next morning with skin that is glowing and soft like a baby's booty i'm telling you this transforms my skin whenever i'm wearing it not only does it help to calm and soothe if i have irritation going on but it just makes my skin look so soft and supple and glowy holy crap and last but certainly not least is the dermatology peptide night cream so this is going to be for those of you that not only want a nice moisturizer but also one that is going to help with anti-aging and the reason why this is my number one pick for that is because it has six different peptides in it which are going to help to improve the appearance of fine lines wrinkles it's going to help to boost elasticity and skin firmness so one of the combinations of peptides in this that you may be familiar with is my trixel 3000 but then on top of that there are four other great peptides for the skin as well and then on top of that of course there's some other really nice ingredients that will help to replenish and calm the skin including things like ceramides cholesterol and a lantern so all around amazing ingredient set i do want to point out the fact that there's one ingredient on this label that is known to be comedogenic in higher amounts that is called isopropyl palmitate it's fifth on the label though so it's not something that causes issue for me this doesn't make me break out but just wanted to point that out if you're incredibly acne prone you may want to go with one of the other options this is definitely going to be one of the best formulas if you have dry skin because it is really nice and creamy for me personally i don't typically reach for this during the daytime but it is such a nice nighttime moisturizer and even though it is a creamier option it still is not something that feels heavier like it's just clogging your pores nothing like that it has such a nice silky soft formula to it it feels so so good so another that i think is absolutely amazing had to include it in my top five for that reason all right you guys we have made it to the end of this video those are all of the five moisturizers that i wanted to share with you you may be surprised that i left out some moisturizers that i have raved about over the past couple years that doesn't mean that i don't like those moisturizers or wouldn't recommend them it's just that these are a little bit better so but if you did enjoy this please don't forget to give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel

        "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to my channel and welcome to my bathroom we are hanging out today we are doing my morning skincare routine together which I'm very excited about because I have it all sitting right here super easy just a super casual video pop on my phone turn it on let's hang out type of video um but this is my morning skincare routine that I've been using consistently and my skin loves it these products are super effective and I will tell you a little bit about my skin really quick I'm 44 years old so with my skincare products I am looking for anti-aging you guys know that I am big on the best Anti-aging products so I look for anti-aging but then also I gear my products towards my skin type which we all should do so I have rosacea prone skin um I did have rosacea I cleared that on my own I have so many videos on how I did that and talking about rosacea and how to clear it you know yourself which you can absolutely do um but I still have rosacea prone skin so I have to keep it balanced you know at all times if I use something wrong or I just do something you know what I mean like it can it can like just come back out so I still have rosacea prone skin I just have to keep it balanced and it's a daily you know balance and commitment so I have rosacea prone skin I have oily skin I have acne prone Skin So this routine is really Geared for all of those issues um and a lot of these products you can use if you have dry skin you know anti-aging in general like it's very good for people who want non-inflammatory products which we honestly should all be using too these are all very non-inflammatory they're very healing very great for all skin types honestly so just a little bit you know about me if you don't know my background here but let's get started let's grab our skincare grab some coffee let's get ready for the day together don't forget to hit subscribe and let's get to it you guys okay so first things first I did just wash my face I used the LC clinical the bioenzyme cleanser I love this cleanser it is so good again for all skin types whether you are dry sensitive oily anything like anybody can use this so this is an enzyme cleanser which it basically really deeply cleanses the pores and it has like gentle Botanical enzymes fruit enzymes that really just gently exfoliate the skin so it's great for again anti-aging too this does not strip the Skin Barrier of any moisture it does not you know take any natural oils from your skin it's very healthy for your skin barrier but at the same time deeply deeply cleanses and really helps it just gently like exfoliate on a constant basis so I really have been loving this cleanser it's so so good oh and then after I wash my face I take my little Clean Skin Club towels back here you guys because I do not use that towel on my face that is for my body I only touch my face with Clean Skin Club towels so whenever I dry my skin that is what I use on my face because if you don't know like towels even though I bleach them obviously I wash them on a constant basis like I do not let my towels sit there for more than like a day they still have like bacteria and you just like remnants of like grossness on them so when you put them on your face you're just like kind of picking up just like extra bacteria on your skin so even though you think they're clean they're not so um I love my Clean Skin Club towels they're disposable they're biodegradable um and you will see a difference with your skin honestly so I always try my skin with that so moving on I'm going to use my toner next and I'm using the hydren hin active Mist with you guys this is my go-to every single day I use this constantly I've been raving about this constantly since this came out so this is a myth that again great for all skin types but it is so antimicrobial antibacterial it knocks out inflammation in the skin so well that if you have rosacea if you have acne prone skin if you have eczema any of those skin conditions you need to be using this if you are not using this you are missing out so much so I actually just posted a um I posted a picture on my community post here on YouTube I was talking about it in my Instagram stories so hydrin posted this this person's hand who had extreme eczema like inflammation red eczema all over her hand and then within six days of using this Mist on her hand her hand was completely clear so it's very very healing it's very balancing for the skin and again when you have like rosace and acne you have a lot of imbalances in like the bacteria on your skin and all of those things so this just sets everything perfectly you're going to see your skin clear up from breakouts you are going to see redness with you know rosacea just reduce so much and inflammation is something we all want to knock out in our skin so I'm going to use this and I'm actually this has the most beautiful Mist you guys so you can I'll do it like like this today um I just got my lashes done so sometimes I take it with a cotton pad which I use the clean SK Clean Skin Club cotton pads as well these are like the best you guys they are like such a good size really soft nice pad I love these so I brought those on to skin SCU recently too because I started using them myself you know everything that I use I share with you guys but you can take this just spray it all over just set your skin up perfectly knock out that inflammation so I let that dry into my skin because this is a question I actually get asked a lot is hypochlorous acid which is the main ingredient of that hypoc chloris acid people say oh can you use that with antioxidants and you can the the thing is you want to make sure that the hypochlorous acid that you're using is really dried into your skin and then you move on to your other products so you know it's been shown that hypochloric acid can kind of like deactivate you know antioxid within your skin but not if you let it dry first if you're using them like if you're spraying this with like your vitamin C product at the same time then yeah it's going going to kind of like minimize the effects of your antioxidants but you can absolutely use them in the same not my hair's all crazy you can absolutely use them in the same routine just let that hypochloric acid let that dry into your skin okay so now I am taking my neogenesis recovery which is your growth factor exome serum which is one of the best of the best products in the entire world it is so good I swear everyone should be using this and again if you have rosacea if you have acne brone skin if you are looking to really focus on anti-aging for your skin this is a must there's two really great potent like exome serums exome growth factor serums neogenesis recovery and the plated these are my two favorites and I use one in the morning one at night you don't have to to do that you can easily use you know one of these twice a day um I just love them both so much so I just kind of both you know I give them both some love for me personally I think the neogenesis recovery just knocks out inflammation so much which if you have rosacea which you have if you have acne prone skin again you need to focus on knocking out that inflammation on a constant basis this also reduces pore size it also will help to kind of create this like healthy structure within your skin you're going to notice that your skin kind of firms up it creates that like elasticity within your skin so that everything becomes a little bit more firm it's absolutely amazing for anti-aging so growth factors exosomes are known for their Rejuvenation of the skin so it does a whole ton of things so it's going to really help to again knock out redness knock out inflammation in the skin it is going to reduce por size it is going to help to reduce any discoloration on your skin so if you have any hyperpigmentation little Sun damaged spots this is going to help to reduce that and it does do it in a way that this is just so rejuvenating you know in such a multitasking way that it does a lot of different things in one so I'm going to take this serum today and this bottle is almost gone but don't worry I have it backup it's just a very very light serum growth factors and exosomes have to go on first to your skin so I'm taking this all over first and you can obviously put this under your eyes too growth factors exomes these type of serums can safely be can safely be used under the eyes which obviously helps that area a lot too I'm also going to take this down my neck and take everything down my neck you guys and for time's sake I'm not going to show myself doing that but just know that all of these products I take down my neck too okay so once that is dried again into my skin I give it like a minute or two to really you know absorb and dry into my skin I'm moving on to my vitamin C and antioxidant products and I am using myology SE boost so this is my brand and I absolutely love this product so much like obviously I formulated it I you know have an amazing chemist who I take my ideas to I'm like I want this I want this I want this together blah blah blah and he creates it and makes it happen in the best way so this is literally like everything I want in a vitamin C product so this is a 20% THD ascorbate which THD ascorbate is my personal favorite form of vitamin C it's so good for all skin types not all skin types can really handle an Elis corbic acid a lot of people have irritation with Elis corbic acid um but THD ascorbate has been found to be just as effective as Elis corbic acid in fact it actually has been found to get deeper within the skin than aloric acid it penetrates really really well into your skin and it is great for sensitive skin acne prone skin Rose Ros Asia prone skin anyone who has like you know know wanting to rebuild Their Skin Barrier it's just good for everyone you will not have irritation or sensitivity to THD ascorbate so there's 20% THD in this but then I also because I am obsessed with antioxidants I put 15 other antioxidants in here top antioxidants that are actually I put them in potent amounts too because you guys know me I'm like potent give me the potent like all all of that so they're super potent but they're actually all the best antioxidants have actually been clinically found to be more um more effective than vitamin C in terms of fighting free radicals in terms of repairing damage from free radicals because again we're getting hit by free radicals all day all day long you can't stop that our skin is in constant like attack mode so I have 15 different antioxidants in here that are actually doing a better job than vitamin C to protect your skin from those free radical anti-inflammatory ingredients in here there's also peptides and the pep that I chose to be in this are very firming clinically tested to actually go into the skin cell and create this youthfulness that you know your skin as you start to get older starts to lack so it kind of brings your cells back to this youthful State and they act younger so you get a more firming effect to your skin it creates this elasticity within your skin um it's got everything you guys so it's obviously my favorite vitamin C I made it myself for me and and you guys as well so I'm taking a pump of this and what I'm what I'm going to share with you guys is I actually you don't need a Mist with this so there are some thds bate products that the brand say you know use a Mist to kind of like massage it in you really don't need a Mist with this at all it's very very light on the skin it just absorbs beautifully it leaves you glowing you do not need a Mist with it but I personally am obsessed with like Mists and there's two that I really really love to use with my products neogenesis moisturizing mist and the lra clinical the bio the hydrating mineral Mist I love these Mist so much um and I'll let you guys in on a little secret I'm making my own try anti-aging Mist which is so good you guys oh my gosh um but I love using a Mist with my products one because you're getting extra ingredients just deeper Within your skin because you're hydrating your skin so if you you probably have already heard this when you have dampened skin your products are going to absorb better that's why I like a lot of different skincare products on their label it's like use me first use me first on damp skin because they want their products to absorb the best obviously into your skin so anytime you can kind of like refresh your skin and like dampen your skin between products you're just getting that much better penetration from your skincare you can kind of remiss your skin during you know between layers and then apply your skin care next so again this is the chology the vitamin C it's the C boost your intense defense serum I literally named it that because it literally does everything you can also take this up under your eyes so it's going to actually help Wren up the under eyes anti-age the under eyes because anytime you can get all those ingredients that I packed into this under your eyes oh my gosh it's so good so stay tuned for the chology Mist that is in the works I have been making the formulation perfect um but you can see like with that try vitamin C like it's not sticky it is not tacky it's non- irritating like there's it's so light and it absorbs so well that's what I really really made it to do so that is my vitamin C for the day now we're going to move on to another favorite product of mine which is going to be your hyaluronic acid and this is honestly my favorite hyaluronic acid I don't always really believe in a lot of hyaluronic acids um but these two like this brand I just love so much and it's just done such wonders for my skin and it's the hydrin ha serums now there's two different ones so there's the hydrin renewing ha serum which if you just have anti-aging you know on your on your agenda you know if you just want like pure anti-aging you don't really have any skin conditions that you're looking to clear up and you just want a super potent you know injectable grade hyaluronic acid that gets deep within your skin that knocks out inflammation that you know has peptides and antioxidants just such great great technology to it then you're going to use the renewing ha now if you want something that is going to really help to Build Your Skin Barrier if you have rosacea if you have acne this is what you want and it's the hydrin restorative ha serum so I love this one too you can use this postprocedure it really really helps to heal your skin so much faster um but again it's got antioxidants it's got peptides but there's a lot of ingredients in here to really heal your skin knock out that inflammation again rosacea acne tons of inflammation in your skin um you have to be really gearing your products to that so just depends on what you want I love them both they both have the same consistency same texture I'm going to use the restorative a today um which is probably the one that I personally use the most because again rosacea acne prone skin but these hydrate so well it's like a drink of water for your skin it like immediately it like immediately makes your skin feel so good you guys like I said it's my favorite ha on the market which says a lot because there's a lot of ha's out there um this is by far my favorite okay so we got our ha on we are going to move on to our last step well almost last step but we're going to do our moisturizer next now I will tell you after the hydrin ha you do not need a moisturizer this is actually an ha serum that you don't need a moisturizer after there's most I would say you do because you need to lock in that hydration otherwise the you know it's GNA the moisture from your SK your skin is going to get sucked out by like your surroundings not with these so you don't need a moisturizer but I personally always use a moisturizer during the day even though I am oily acne prone this is a moisturizer that I really really love it's the neogenesis barrier renewal cream I am always always looking to keep My Skin Barrier healthy and I tell you guys this all the time it is such a number one thing that you need to be you know working on because our Skin Barrier is under attack every single day and when you don't have a healthy Skin Barrier your skin is not going to be bouncy it is not going to be glowing it is not going to look its best it's going to be dehydrated it's going to be shriveled up it's going to be red it's going to be irritated it's going to be flaky no good you guys Skin Barrier Health should be everyone's like top like top goal for your skin so I love this I also really love the Cente dermal repair I love these so much like they honestly both work so so well um but today I'm just going to use the neogenesis barrier renewal and you know they're both like very light on the skin so they're great for Daytime Nighttime but they're very light they just absorb really well and if you notice I'm not going around my eyes because I'm going to apply my eye cream which I actually usually do before my moisturizer but I'm talking to you guys and I'm forgetting what I'm doing here so during the day here let me pull out my eye cream for my eye cream drawer which I have way too many eye creams in here but you know I test out and give you guys the best of the best um but for the daytime I love the kisum the eye Contour lifting cream so I use this during the day all the time um and then I use my skin sual as AG at night this is a great just super light kind of gel form consistency that is so good for firming the under eye too it's got your growth factors in it so it has that technology you guys know kisim is like so good and at the top of their game for growth factors exosomes all of that stuff so it has that technology in it so it's going to be firming it's going to be tightening it's gonna be brightening it's so good you guys I love it and the thing that I love about it's just so light so light during the day and it's my top three it's in my top three eye creams you guys know my top three cuz I've made videos on it before and um this is definitely one of them I use that during the day pretty much every single day um and that is my skincare routine for the for the day you guys that is my skin look at how glowy look at how nice I'm ready for the day um what I'm going to do now is apply my sunscreen because you never

        "transcript": "hey guys it's Jen let's talk rosacea so humor is Asia or even just light redness here and there we are also into the natural makeup look you know it's a struggle so it's something that I've been testing out on a cement whole life you know when I was younger before I wore makeup I was trying out different primers and moisturizers just trying to figure out how I could not have redness but also not wear ten pounds of makeup so here are my top products for a natural look with rosacea I'm gonna go an order of my makeup routine in general not every single thing is in here but I'm just gonna go in order like how you should do your makeup so number one is this cooling primer from origins skin always used a primer from a skincare brand I just feel like it's a um but so I'm no professional but with rosacea I would try to find a cooling primer from a skincare brand my dear friends EJ works at origin so she gifts me with this always so never rosacea she's gonna be masks and stuff too for it so this is called origins original skin I'd support perfecting cooling primer with will over it has this cool foaming consistency it's moisturizing and it's pore perfecting and it actually works but it has this like light pink tone to it and the nude color I just find neutralizes my skin before I put any makeup on it's amazing okay so what I do next is foundation this has been a lifelong journey of figuring out what foundation to use that's not really cakey not too thick but yet I wanted to cover my redness so what I found really works which you'll also see my next product is getting a product that's tanner than your skin not with an orange gel and I don't mean like to tan but like just getting something that doesn't have a pink usually when you go to get color-match safor or something if they match your skin tone they're gonna have something with like it's gonna be like pale with a rosy pink tone to it and every single time I hate how I look when they color match me cause I'm like I just feel paler and I feel like I'm either covering up my skin with more paleness or the rosiness that you match me with is bringing out my rosacea I say if you know getting color matched I like something that makes me a little tanner too so with that being said this is the Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation sure you've heard of it everywhere but I've tried everything born this way you know all those mainstream ones and then I've also tried a Chanel one that I loved forever but now when I go back to it just too pale for me but so the reason I love this one is because it is the lightest thing ever it really does feel like stealth and I hate that any product that works for rosacea has to be so cakey and thick so I love how thin it is and for something so thin it actually covers up your redness your Rose a picnic still picnic your rosy pinkness still just comes through a little bit but almost in like a little blush way I have it on out when you blend it under your neck a little bit to it just like seamlessly goes into your skin it's not like your face is like one color on your neck so different one that's like you still kind of want it to match and look natural Exhibit A I'm in 5.25 and a little like brown tone to it instead of getting something with a rosy tone to it can help to cover the redness with any foundation okay now this is what I consider my secret sauce this is the one product that I have used I think it's the first make on maybe besides like mascara that I ever use my sister doesn't really wear makeup but this is like the one thing she always always used and when I first used it I sort of just use it as a bronzer let it realize for years because I was so young that it's actually called foundation so it's the bare minerals matte foundation and it has SPF of 50 which is amazing it's a powder but the trick here is that if you're using it as a foundation I probably wouldn't about in the color tan but I was always using it as a bronzer just all over my face before I even know how to do makeup but it looked so good like after I put on my liquid foundation so I've been doing it ever since so I put my liquid foundation on first and then I used this bronzer but I put it all over my face cuz it's a foundation and I swear it is the Holy Grail gets rid of all of my redness my skin looks like the smoothest one shade map thing you've ever seen but it looks like I'm not wearing anything cuz it's a powder it is unbelievable I get the color tan which is like literally the 20th thing on the spectrum and pale usually but look probably to know that I'm as pale as I really am so if you buy anything from this video it must be this because it is not advertised well enough no one really knows about it and it is like my holy holy ground so now this kind of cutting into my my makeup routine this is what I wear on an everyday basis so I don't wear like a full face to make up like this every single day I only do like the liquid foundation and then the powder foundation that whole thing if I'm going out that sounds like we're doing so much but it does not look like it I don't think I mean obviously I'm wearing makeup but I just think I like a natural situation going on it cosmetics it's just a CC cream it feels like moisturizer it's SPF 50 plus which for your rosacea girls you know SPF it's key you know you're supposed to wear it every single day like I don't remember his put on sunscreen every single day so in fact when I wear this I guess I do wear sunscreen every day take a rest in my shade is medium cuz again I don't like color matching I always get something that's gonna be bronzing as well it's basically like a tinted moisturizer but for some reason I don't really love those this is just like this is more full coverage than a tinted moisturizer I'm obsessed with it I wear it every single day I look like beanie and red and like I try not to on the steam room but like let's say go in the steam room and I'm the most veiny red version of myself ever and then I washed my face whenever and you put this on it seriously changes drastically so for an everyday product that looks natural no no you have makeup on it's like it's a little creamier and thicker than the other things I mentioned it is a little thick but like it just blends in so smoothly to your skin it it just it just rubs right in I put a little bit on my neck just to like make it gradually go down I seriously can't say enough good things about this this and the bareMinerals products I get this is actually my Holy Grail because if I had to be in a deserted island or go anywhere gonna only take two things it would be this mascara so I guess this is a value holding girl okay here's a concealer it's from NARS this concealer I honestly wouldn't call it that full coverage but for everyday just all you don't really want to have to wear concealer but you just want to cover up your redness a bit I use this because it doesn't feel like I'm wearing this thick concealer as you can tell I hate wearing thick makeup I hate feeling like I have makeup on my face all day I hate it and you'd make up I mean sometimes I go without it but I feel like any makeup when my rosacea is really acting up and I'm inflamed and red so this product just makes me like get rid of it not fully fully fully but it's a great product it's the NARS radiant creamy concealer I'm in medium one custard yeah that's really all I have to say about is if you need like a very light concealer that's like medium to full coverage but not thick and creamy I like this one okay next I use this every day okay so this is an awesome awesome bronzer as you can tell I like cream and not powder products besides the bareMinerals so this is obviously a little pricey side but honestly I guess the suggestion is just cream bronzer in general I've used other cream bronzers before but there's so much darker and if so I really rubbed them in and like pop them into your skin and it like contour is even it's like so dark the reason I love this one is because this one's a very natural color the Chanel sole a tan ditional so it's this balm consistency as you can tell I used a ton of it I've had it for well over a year so it lasts forever so I think it's still worth the price I've only bought one ever I've never had to buy a new one and I've been using it for I think two years like weekly all the time at the bottom it says bronzing makeup base so it's not like this dark contour bronzer it's something that you can just like Pat into your skin from literally Center cheek I do it all here and up here and here and I like really rub it on because for me it also acts as a concealer so view of rosacea it's like this natural finish so you can just like use it like concealer just warms up your face gives you color and for me that's for my rosacea I think everyone's rosacea is the most terrible is either full cheek and I can't just put like white concealer on my full cheap it's really on the foundation and this I think it's worth the price just because you like never need to get a new one this next tip is just powder in general but obviously I'm sure you've heard of it Laura Mercier's translucent powder what powder does is it sets your concealer and everything so then it'll last all day so that's number one because it'd be really spicy food or something and or you're in the Sun that's when your rosacea flames up so to have powder in general just to like set everything in and make it last longer of course great second of all eight eliminate shine so sometimes when you're really red and oily it just like makes everything so much worse so if you put this even if you don't have like concealer exactly on your redness I put it just everywhere I ever I did because I feel like it just comes down it sets it it gives it like an airbrushed finish and you know with them in the Sun or something and I'm about to shine it's like a half powder it just helps the whole situation you got the point okay my next tip is just highlighters in general but I have two recommendations so a lot of people per se should think that they can't wear highlighter because it's like drawing attention to the area where you've redness but it really does it because you're putting it on your cheekbone so it's almost drawing attention away from it number one and number two instead of using blush it's like a gold tone so again it's also kind of acting like a cover-up so the colors I like as you know if I use a powder and really like to use a cream one first so I like this what's whacks up Watts up don't let my pronounce it whack wax up benefit cream highlighter I love the color I think it's great just anything that doesn't have like a rose gold tone that's gonna bring out our rosacea love it and I use Becca's champagne pop on top of it I love the combo of the cream that's like sets into your skin and then like a light brush of the powder they're similar colors they're both like champagne II so I just take a little combo and just think they're good dish I would name first champagne color with you have rosacea not sure why but it seems squirt for me anyway thank you so much for watching I hope that you could just take even one product from hearing it alleviates your rosacea because we all know the insecurities that come with redness in general and just inflamed rosacea it's really the worst for my top skincare products that have helped me with my rosacea I watched my video here on the top skincare products that it helped me with my research I just got that I'm gonna quit well I ahead alright see you guys next time mom you [Music]",

        "published_at": "2021-12-15T14:00:10Z",
        "transcript": "cooler weather has arrived and it's usually around this time of year that my patients start asking me for moisturizer recommendations for cold weather and for dry skin so here are my picks [Music] i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and to find skincare products that work for you if you like this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel the whole concept of changing up your skincare seasonally really is going to vary based on your skin and where you live but in the winter what i often find is that people their skin feels thirsty and that's because cold air does not hold on to as much moisture so your skin is naturally going to be dried out being in that environment day after day the other thing is you're also exposed to indoor heating a lot of the time and indoor heating also kind of strips the air of its natural moisture especially if you're not using a humidifier so it just makes your skin more prone to dryness and that's why a lot of people want a thicker more occlusive just a little bit more of like a yummy moisturizer to put on their face during the winter time that being said you absolutely do not have to change up your moisturizer or your skincare routine based on the season you have to give your skin what it wants and needs and if your skin feels fine doing the same routine year round that's absolutely okay too for example i find that i don't necessarily need to increase the creaminess or the richness of my moisturizer during the winter time but i do like to moisturize twice a day during the winter when normally i would just moisturize once a day so sometimes it's not just about shifting your products but shifting how you're using them in your skincare routine so without further ado let's get into the products what you'll notice is a lot of the products have the same types of ingredients good moisturizers tend to have three main categories of ingredients they have humectant ingredients emollient ingredients and occlusive ingredients humectant ingredients draw water into the outer layers of the skin and it can do that sort of in two ways one it can pull water from the deeper layers of the skin to the surface and if there is moisture in the air like humidity it can actually pull water from the air into the top layers of the skin and those types of ingredients are things like glycerin hyaluronic acid lactic acid and urea emollient ingredients i really think of as texture enhancers because they smooth the surface of the skin ingredients like squalane dimethicone grapeseed oil or just any plant oils cocoa butter those are all emollient ingredients what's kind of interesting about emollients is they often also have some occlusive properties which i'm about to talk about occlusives are the final category of moisturizing ingredients and they really serve a protective barrier function they are like the seal on the surface of the skin to prevent trans epidermal water loss or just increase moisture loss from the skin occlusive ingredients are often the ingredients that will make a product feel quite thick or heavy or even greasy and those are things like petrolatum lanolin waxes and silicone so as you might imagine there will be a lot of overlapping ingredients in the products i'm about to talk about when you are trying to find a moisturizer that works well for you so much of it is not about the ingredients themselves but the formulation how it plays with your skin and how it plays with the other products that you have in your routine and so it's very hard to tell someone yes 100 this moisturizer is going to work for you sometimes there's trial and error involved my first winter moisturizer that i think is wonderful is the first aid beauty ultra repair firming collagen cream this bad boy is just amazing this cream is quite thick but it has just this very slight moussy texture not fully whipped but it's enough that when you put it on it doesn't feel immediately heavy but you can tell like this is rich if you've used first aid beauty's ultra repair cream which is sort of like a body and face cream this collagen based one has a little more smoothness to it so it feels a little more cosmetically elegant to use on the face and i think it's just like an awesome nighttime moisturizer especially for winter next up i have the allies of skin peptides and antioxidants firming daily treatment i know a lot of people are looking for nighttime inclusive thick greasy options for winter but i also wanted to give a daytime option because i think it's really important that you are able to moisturize your skin during the day and don't feel like you're using a moisturizer that's weighing your skin down i have found this product to layer so well not only with my other serums but also under makeup and not sort of break up my products over the course of the day so if you're looking for a daytime option this is great that's not to say that the other moisturizers that i mentioned during this video can't be used during the daytime as well i just find that when i'm putting makeup on i want something that's sort of going to grip my makeup products and almost act like a primer which this i feel does very well for me whereas sometimes i feel like other moisturizers are a bit too heavy or a bit too greasy and things are just going to slip right off i also want to acknowledge the fact that i recognize that this is not a cheap moisturizer however i do find that it has a lot of sort of bonus ingredients it has vitamin c it has a couple of really good peptides in it it has some brightening agents it has niacinamide so it's not just a moisturizer in my mind and i actually think if you are a minimalist and you just want to put on like one thing under your sunscreen and then be out the door this serves that purpose too next up on my winter moisturizers list is the tatcha indigo overnight repair serum and cream treatment i actually was never going to try this because it is a little bit spendy but i got it sent to me when i made like a big purchase order from sephora so i had a sample to use for a couple of weeks and it's really good i think out of all the moisturizers i'm talking about today this one feels the most luxurious on the skin it goes on so silky and smooth and it doesn't really feel heavy even though it feels incredibly hydrating on the skin also as someone who has sensitive skin and is rosacea prone i was a little apprehensive to try it but it said that it had calming properties and i really felt that when i put it on like my skin felt soothed so obviously i have a lot of moisturizers in my stash because of my job and what i do but i'm really tempted to buy this because it was great when i was using it and when it's sitting there on your shelf it's so beautiful like you want to use it it calls to and that's the other part about using a moisturizer is you have to do it regularly to see the best benefits and some of that is just having a skincare item that inspires you to want to use it and for this tatcha product like i'm all in i want it every day i definitely wanted at least one drugstore option in this and i actually could make a whole video just on great drugstore moisturizers if you guys want that put it in the comments below but the neutrogena hydro boost gel cream is a wonderful moisturizer both for winter and i really think for year round because this is a gel cream formulation it still is very moisturizing but it has a lighter weight texture so i particularly like this for people who have oily skin but still feel like their skin is dehydrated and you absolutely can have oily skin that lacks water especially in the winter but if you have oily skin you might not want to reach for like a thick creamy rich moisturizer and that's where a gel cream like this neutrogena one is perfect my final facial moisturizer before i go into sort of some body face overlap creams is the kiehl's ultra facial moisturizer and this one will always hold a very special place in my heart because i pretty much exclusively used this moisturizer during the winter when i lived in colorado during my interim year this ultra facial cream also sort of falls in the category of could be used day or night or both because it is a quite light texture while still being very rich and moisturizing so it is one of those products where i was able to layer my makeup on over it and not have any issues with it melting off during the day i also loved wearing this moisturizer when i was going to be out skiing for the day in the morning i would put the moisturizer on follow it up with sunscreen and then i would be out on the slopes all day long wind uv light from the sky uv light reflecting off of the snow and at the end of the day my skin was still doing pretty well it didn't feel overly stressed my rosacea flares were kept at a minimum and that is a testament both too the value of sun protection but also the ability for this moisturizer to just lock in hydration into my skin so that my skin didn't feel depleted even when it was under a lot of environmental stress so all of those moisturizers are pretty much marketed for facial use yes you absolutely could use them on your body but you would go through it so fast but the other thing people often will ask me is can i use a body moisturizer on my face and you totally can so i did want to just mention a couple of body moisturizers or ones that are sort of marketed as body moisturizers that absolutely can be used on the face and make great facial moisturizers too the first moisturizer i wanted to give like a legit shout out to is the first aid beauty ultra repair cream i have used this moisturizer for so many years it's always one that i reach to and go back to and when i travel i will often put some of this in like a little jar so that i can use it on my face and body to just simplify my routine i also have found that just in my dermatology practice that my teenagers with eczema love this cream and i don't know if it's just because it's more of a beauty brand than sort of like a drugstore brand and it feels more exciting to put on but for whatever reason the compliance with applying this particular moisturizer in my eczema patients is amazing speaking of drugstore moisturizers i don't think i could make a winter moisturizer video without mentioning the cerave moisturizing cream cerave is pretty much the most well known for incorporating ceramides into their formulations hence the name cerave but this cream is just a great blend of humectants emollients and occlusives and i find that it is just incredibly user friendly like it's very rare that i find someone who can't get benefit from using this cream i also love that it comes in a jar that has a pump on top i think that increases compliance for me there's something about like dipping my fingers into like a big tub that i don't love so having the pump on top just makes me want to use it this is another one of the moisturizers i travel with the most because it can be used on face and on body and if you're just looking for a great all-around no-nonsense moisturizer for the wintertime this is it what is your favorite winter moisturizer make sure to tell me in the comments don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel and i will see you next time [Music] [Music] you",

        "transcript": "what's up everyone we're back Dr matchfield Dr Shaw and welcome back to our Channel Dr Lee where we talk about all things skincare and dermatology we are jumping back into our series that was requested by all of you in our community post which is creating more routines around different skin conditions and skin types So today we're going to be able to create a acne routine now when we create these routines they're not really for everyone but this is just a general idea of what a really good acting routine looks like we'll talk a little bit about how to treat acne what causes acne and why we're choosing certain ingredients and certain products when we're creating these routines but that's the goal of today yeah exactly I think it's very important distinction that with that's the whole the whole uh I was going to say thrust but I can't think of an alternative so thrust of the whole Channel everything we bring forward is to help you just make deliberate decisions piecemeal pick apart tailor it towards your skin because every skincare routine is personalized even in the office to tell people you know this is something we're going to come back to in a few months everyone's skin reacts differently and we're going to arrows towards your skin so do the same pick it apart see what works for you we're going to provide you the tools to build an acne routine you know what a good analogy is here say for example you go to a store and you buy a dress are you buy a suit now you buy the suit in the size that is fitting your shoulders in general but doesn't necessarily fit you in the body it doesn't fit you in the sleeves but the overall fits pretty good but it's not perfect right so then you go to a tailor and that tailor is you right so we're giving you the suit sort of off the rack and you need to make little tailor-made changes to it this is such a good this is so proud of myself how is this a terrible knowledge I don't know if you'll buy these things anymore you feel like this is a better analogy for like 1930. no what do you mean people buy dresses like you buy a dress and and then you you shorten it you make the sleeves longer you make the sleeves shorter how many of you use a tailor in our audience like one percent 0.1 percent this is everybody so this is everybody okay well I thought it was a great analogy Whatever by the way join our Facebook group join our newsletter that's our housekeeping stuff all things acne routine here we go here we go acne before we did a video on rosacea which is actually loved the video on rosacea as poorly as I think it probably looks but it's important that you realize like not all things are acne so before you dedicate your time effort money energy into investing and building an acne routine just make sure that's what you're actually dealing with right so we did a video in the past it was like is this acne is this rosacea or is this something else and we can link it above so you can watch that video but the idea was that when I was seeing a lot of especially in my direct messages which I don't respond to direct medical questions in my comments by the way but I was seeing a lot of people send me pictures of rosacea in their face because I look at the pictures and and they would say like this acne routine is not working for me and I wish I could respond and say hey you don't have acne you actually have rosacea so getting the correct diagnosis is super important and having a board-certified dermatologist do that is going to get you in the right direction there's a company called Cortina that saw that video they reached out to us to sponsor a video in the past this video is not sponsored but what they said that they would offer to our audience which I think is pretty cool is that they would give everybody a free diagnosis to make sure that they were on the right track with their skincare Journey so what you do is we'll put a link below click on the link you'll answer some questions you upload some pictures it's not going to end up in like the Deep Web on a cloud somewhere because this is all like hitbook and plucking if they can't like password information out but basically they have a board-certified dermatologist look at your photos and give you the diagnosis no requirement to buy anything but they'll give you the diagnosis to make sure that you're at least have the right diagnosis to go down the right path of your skincare Journey which I think is pretty cool that they're giving that to the doctor the audience and this was literally made for our Channel because of that video which is why it's so cool that we have this community but today let's talk about this acne routine so for acne we've talked about the Deep principles of it basically with hormones changing skin you get an increase of oil production which clogs supports that helps bacteria Thrive which causes inflammation and those are your tendons of acne and so everything you use should be tailored towards one or all of those four steps we've done a lot of videos on acne in the past that you can watch but we're going to just simply build you a routine at this point and we're going to follow that cleanse tree protect algorithm that we always have so for acne you could always use a regular cleanser in your cleanse steps so we'll start with the night routine but there's also a lot of good acne specific cleansers out there and what ingredients would you look for in an acne cleanser these two ingredients are actually ingredients I like better in cleansers than I like is levons there's nothing wrong with them in Lee bongs but I really love how they function in cleansers and that's benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid they both have unique properties benzoyl peroxide is pretty drying but I do think it's the most effective ingredient it really kills bacteria prolifically it really complements and elevates a lot of other ingredients like synergistically and then additionally it modulates inflammation it's weird to say something is like anti-inflammatory when it's irritating sometimes but it kind of modulates the acne inflammation as well I agree yeah so benzyl peroxide is one one ingredient I find that some people just do not tolerate at all in their skincare routine so it's not like just sometimes mild irritation for some people some people sometimes it's really really bad and so definitely listen to your skin but for people that this does work for it works phenomenally well for for the face and even the studies show that you don't need mega high doses of benzyl peroxide for it to be effective in fact lower doses have been shown to be just as effective so I would look for four percent benzoyl peroxide cleanser especially for the face uh CeraVe has an acne control foaming cleansing and that that one whatever it's tricked and we'll put the picture up um and that's that that's their four percent and panoxyl also has a four percent benzoyl peroxide cleanser as well and the one I was reaching for and inadvertently threw them off here sorry it's uh the acetylchter came out with this gentle clear line and they have a complexion clearing VPO acne cleanser that's a 2.6 VPO but what I like about it too it's micronized and it has zinc topically and licorice there there this line is lit it is amazing but this has topless ink it also uh had licorice in it I think I said licorice to help with the dark spots but the thing I like about the micronized portion it not only helps with like stability increased penetration the follicles to really increase the efficacy also some of the studies with micronized ingredients also show that it kind of disperses more easily Across the Skin to prevent hot spots and minimize irritation so there were there are a lot of like prescription benzoyl peroxide products this mimics those and it does it better I think it's great micronized benzyl peroxide haven't seen this cleanser before but I'm familiar because a lot of our prescription products actually from the same company the galderma portfolio has a lot of micronized benzyl peroxide so familiar with how it works and overall seems like a great product I have to check that out of course beware benzyl peroxide does bleach clothing towels bedding your hair I don't care I found some Reddit proof that it can bleach your hair didn't he I actually tried it I told you I would do it for like a month I did and it didn't bleach it I didn't I didn't say anything about it I just kind of left him on oh well fair enough maybe it doesn't bleach everybody's hair but just be careful be cautious with your Linens use white linens if you have to um and make sure you wash it off entirely off your face the other option that we mentioned is to use a salicylic acid cleanser I wouldn't use both because that would probably be too irritating so pick one or the other depending on if you have more oily skin salicylic acid maybe a little bit better but then again benzyl peroxide can be a little bit drying so you just have to really listen to your skin on this one the CeraVe acne control Gel Cleanser has two percent salicylic acid in it the inky list has one too I think also affordable um two percent salicylic acid cleanser as well so that's where I would start with your night routine pick one or the other the second step of our tree part of this routine what are we going with I would not say retinoids right we're at night time and you're going to start with a foundational ingredient I would start and pick and prioritize the one that's going to do the most and you'll find the derms do this in the office a lot there's a lot of layering questions and to talk about this sometimes but a lot of derms would like emphasize the retinoid make sure you get that on the skin this can be your first step just try to make sure you incorporate this so there's a couple actually there's I feel like a lot of different options here one over the count of this amazing option is adaptolene we've talked about this before there are a lot of studies showing that this is comparable in efficacy to the lower strength prescription tretinoin and that it's also less irritating so if you're going to really try to commit to one over-the-counter ingredient purely in terms of efficacy this is it if you could abandon everything else and you could only you said okay listen I have thirty dollars I gotta pick one thing it would be a dappling for me a dappling is probably the most effective ingredient that we can find over the counter for all forms of acne it solves many of the problems that we have with acne and it's very very well tested used to be prescription now available over the counter available from different also available from La Roche but saying that that blade find whichever one is cheaper for you and go with that of course in this treatment phase you also have the prescriptions that are available from your dermatologist or teledermatitis service we mentioned Cortina they of course do Acme as well but this is where you'd put those treatment routines so that would be where you put your tretino in you'd put your clindamycin whatever's prescribed for you would be also in this treatment phase but if you don't have access to those over the counter definitely adapilate and then last night routine protect so protecting at night contrary to what I used to believe Dr Shaw does not wear sunscreen at night and neither should you you don't need to so the protect at night is really just based off of moisturizing and acne ingredients can be irritating so this step can actually be very important to not only offset the irritation and help you use those acne ingredients better but also just to protect that Skin Barrier so this can be based off of your skin type so some people have dry acne prone skin some people have oily skin we've talked about multiple mattifying moisturizers before the Tulare and Ultra mattifying moisturizer the Cetaphil General mattifying acne moisturizer and then or just a gentle facial moisturizer like the elf fragrance free holy hydration moisturizer just nice balance most normal to combination skin so this is where you either are going to put something that's maybe a little mattifying if you're more oily maybe a little more hydrating if you're more dry we've done a lot of videos on moisturizers in the past you could simply just put a CeraVe or acetophil or a vanity cream moisturizer here in this step but just keep it super simple but I do think that if you're using this you're using a dappling and you're using benzyl peroxide you should definitely be using a hydrating moisturizer as your last step in your skincare we see that night now moving on to the morning routine so for the morning routine some people can tolerate a medicated cleanser twice a day some people cannot so if you need to use a gentle cleanser here that is absolutely acceptable or if you need that gentle cleanser at night also acceptable so after the cleanser then you're going to move on to your active ingredients and this is a place you can actually use something like beta hydroxy acid or salicylic acid toner as a Levon you don't need to duplicate ingredients here so if using a salad cleanser you don't need to do that ingredient again or you can leave use something like azelic acid which can treat your dark spots treat your acne and help with both at once also too if you're seeing a doctor a dermatologist this is were often the topical antibiotics lid it's just like a very gentle very effective ingredient so that's something you might also see in your morning routine yeah so that that's an amazing second step or treat step in a morning routine you don't actually necessarily need this step because you're doing a lot at night already if you have an acne cleanser you have a dappling and in the morning if you want a little extra push I definitely think azelic acid is an amazing step especially if you have dark spots or you could go again in with salicylic acid but you want to kind of ease into this maybe start with one ingredient at a time use it for two to three weeks then introduce these other ingredients but like a complete routine could definitely include all these ingredients and then just follow it with your protect step which is sunscreen so that that will kind of do it super simple here at night cleanse with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid fall with the dappling follow with the gentle Moisturizer in the morning again an acne cleanser if you can tolerate it if not gentle cleanser follow with azelic acid if you have dark spots if not you can can use the salicylic acid toner and then follow that with the sunscreen simple three-step acne routine morning and night well actually try to see if we can put a link below with a link to that routine I think that's something we could probably do for you we're going to try to do more like Graphics handouts goodie bags things like that for use and more visual stuff for you to kind of take home with you when you watch our videos almost like the handout from the class I guess something like that yeah because everybody loves homework well it's not don't do anything with it but uh but if that's helpful let us know I'll I'll get it done uh but just let me know if you like it or you hate it if it makes it easier for you to just have that and not have to go back and reference the video maybe that's something that will be helpful for you so we'll put together a little list for you uh but thank you all so much for tuning in yeah please oh you tricked please like comment and subscribe simple acne routine let us know what other routines you want us to help out with and we'll see you in the next video we'll see you next time what are your thoughts on this here what the heck is this so I'm trying to get my life together Dr Shaw brought up a good point about a year ago nothing to do with acne he was talking about what to do to get healthier and he's like yeah I'm not going to exercise and it's like why not because I love exercise and he's like an easier thing is to do less so I took his approach and did the opposite I'm doing more so I'm trying to eat less I'm still exercising and I was like what's the best supplement out there just to help me get my eating habits in order I heavily researched heavily researched things for just overall eating health and things like that so this is the glucomannon that's the main piece to the puzzle here see like mines that's that was the Clincher I think functionally it's going to help me build new habits and snack less feel Fuller more and that was the ingredient that I was drawn to I mean it's got black pepper and turmeric so I'm okay with it but a supplements always get weird I think when doctors talk about supplements you just become a quack only if you are getting paid getting paid yeah no but I don't know I just yeah I mean he's not paid by lean being at least not that I know of you know the galacto man it seems like a good option I mean let me know how it goes we find out well Zaki said I actually broke my own rule because I went to Orange Theory three times last week what was your rule five times or one no I was trying to go for zero oh I was like oh that's the same rule oh yeah so now I'm in I mean three times the orange theory this past week I actually you know because I I just I'm not like healthy at all and I don't feel good and I'm tired all the time so I was like let me get my life together started going to the gym uh more now I also weigh more than I've ever waited before so do I but regardless more exercise this year see that's it though she thinks you're something interesting with this channel is you're aging with us we're aging with you and so you're gonna get to see us kind of like just do life live life change life as we get a little older here too the race to who see who goes bald first I don't know who knows who knows all right what were we talking about",

        "transcript": "hey skincare nerds welcome back a lot of you found my survey cleanser guide really helpful and i got so many comments from you guys requesting a follow-up video this time about their moisturizers so it did take me a while to make this because i find affordable drugstore moisturizers and sunscreens to be some of the hardest products to find because they're the last steps in your routine that means the finish is really important and they have to really work well with all of the other steps that you've already done in your routine oh and like my cleansers guide this is not a sponsored video i bought all of these products with my own money so don't worry you guys i'm right there with you in the struggle to find a great affordable moisturizer and sunscreen so today we're gonna be comparing five cerave moisturizers the moisturizing cream the moisturizing lotion the facial pm moisturizer the am facial moisturizer and the ultra light moisturizing lotion we are going to look beyond the marketing to answer which one is actually best for your skin [Music] so before we get into it let's talk about what you should actually look for in a moisturizer and why you should even have one in your routine so i used to think that the point of a moisturizer was to add moisture back into my skin turns out moisturizers can do way more than that there are actually three different types of moisturizing ingredients that all do different things for your skin humectants emollients and occlusives humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin draw moisture into your skin which is great if your skin is dehydrated emollients like triglycerides most plant oils and shea butter smooth your skin and makes it feel really nice and soft and occlusive like petrolatum and squalene create a barrier on top to prevent trans epidermal water loss basically they lock in the moisture to keep it from evaporating one major part of finding the best moisturizer for your skin is knowing what skin type you have and figuring out what your skin concerns are i'm not gonna go through all of the different skin types in this video because i already did that in the cleansers video so if you don't know what skin type you are or you just kind of need a little refresher hop on over to that video basically you can have oily dry combination balanced or sensitive skin i like saying balanced skin instead of normal skin because normal skin makes it sound like anyone who doesn't have balance skin isn't normal which just isn't true oh and sometimes sensitive skin is called a skin condition instead of a skin type because you can have both sensitive and dry skin or sensitive and oily skin one thing to watch out for especially if you're prone to breakouts is that some ingredients in moisturizers can be pore clogging or comedogenic cerave has labeled all of these moisturizer formulas non-comedogenic but you should use these non-comedogenic labels as a guide so you know what i'm going to say always patch test your new products so you don't end up with a really bad reaction all serraview products including these moisturizers are fragrance free and have essential ceramides cholesterol fatty acids and hyaluronic acid these ingredients mimic your skin's natural barrier which helps prevent moisture loss and protects it from external damage ceramides are especially great because they act as glue to hold the barrier together so it's helpful for preventing premature aging acne and eczema cerave also has this technology called mve which slowly releases the ingredients into your skin to help with penetration instead of all at once take those two together ceramides and mve and that's how they came up with the name syrupy so it is pronounced cerave not cerave let's start with the moisturizing cream and lotion these are great if your skin is on the balance to dryer side they're formulated so you can use it all over your face and body and you can use these both day and night so the moisturizing cream is the heaviest of the five it's great if you have dry skin so if you have flakiness or a little bit of itching or if you have dry patches as well this is really sensitive skin friendly and eczema friendly too so i would not recommend this as an everyday moisturizer for you if you do have oilier skin or if you're prone to breakouts unless you do have dry skin and you've already patch tested this to make sure that it won't cause any issues for you so as for the packaging you might be used to seeing it in a tub but i got the travel size because i have combo skin and i use this only when i go snowboarding so this size is a lot more convenient to take with me but if you are gonna get the regular size and you don't like tub packaging they do have a version of it with the pump as well as for the formula it's basically a heavier version of the moisturizing lotion and what i mean by that is that it's more occlusive because there's petrolatum in here petrolatum is the most occlusive ingredient out there and it's also what vaseline is made of but you already know all that from watching my slugging video if you haven't it basically creates a physical barrier between your skin and the outside world making it great for preventing that trans epidermal water loss and encouraging wound healing to happen but unlike vaseline which is a hundred percent petrol atom it's not greasy at all if you have extremely dry skin and this isn't working for you but you also don't like vaseline because it's way too greasy cerevi actually has a healing ointment as well which is made of 45 petrolatum so another ingredient i do have to mention is that there is dimethicone a silicone in here actually it is in all of these moisturizers other than the ultralight moisturizing lotion if you don't like silicones in your moisturizer i wouldn't necessarily walk away from these completely i also really don't like silicone textures but silicones aren't the base in these it's actually much further down the ingredient list it's really just there to help with skin soothing and also to provide that kind of like nice velvety finish so let's check it out it's really rich and creamy but it rubs in really well and it doesn't leave any white streaks it doesn't completely sink into your skin when you first apply it because of the occlusives in it it's not really supposed to so again that's not necessarily a bad thing that's what actually makes it really great for drier skin types so it makes your skin feel really smooth and it also leaves like a really nice velvety finish now on to the moisturizing lotion this is really great if you have balance to dry skin but i also think it could be really great if you have combo skin because it's got an oil-free formula it's sensitive skin friendly too actually both the lotion and the cream got a seal of approval from the national eczema association so if you do have eczema or sensitive skin both this one and the cream are great for you to use so formulation wise again it's basically a lighter version of the cream the major difference is that it doesn't have petrolatum in it so it isn't going to be as occlusive it does have polysorbate 20 in it and i mentioned that because i know some of you can be really sensitive to that it also has parabens where the cream does not so if you are sensitive to parabens this might not be so good for you so the difference between this and the cream also comes through in the texture the texture is definitely a lot more watery so it is gonna be lighter weight and smoother and it sinks into your skin really really well but it's also got like a really nice slip to it the finish is a little bit more satiny at first but then it settles in and just kind of looks and feels like skin so i would say that the finish is more like a semi matte it's also not greasy at all and it just really makes your skin feel like super smooth yeah i really like this one all right so let's move on to the pm and am moisturizers which are going to be better for you if you have a balanced to oilier skin type so i really wanted to know like what are the differences between the pm and am moisturizers and the moisturizing lotion one thing that's really obviously different between these two is these guys are a lot smaller they're also about three and a half times more expensive per ounce which is probably why they're marketed for use on your face only i mean using this as a body lotion would be pretty bougie so then the obvious question is are they really worth it so let's start with the cerave pm like the moisturizing lotion it's also an oil-free formula but this is for balance to oilier skin types one major difference between this one and the moisturizing lotion and cream we just talked about is that this has niacinamide in it and niacin white is such a great ingredient with so many benefits if you're worried about anything from preventing aging to breakouts it helps to reduce the look of enlarged pores uneven skin tone fine lines dullness and helps to repair your skin barrier as well i used to really really love this moisturizer and if it's also been your holy grail for a while too you might have noticed that it's actually been reformulated twice in the last three years once around march 2018 and more recently around january 2020 the main difference is that they've switched up the preservative system by swapping out the parabens from the old formula with other preservatives to make it paraben free it's unclear if they made any changes to the niacinamide concentration which used to be four percent i've reached out to find out more about that but i'm still waiting for them to respond if they do confirm the concentration i will put it down below for you guys so one major thing i've personally noticed since the formulation change is that it can sting a little bit especially if my skin's irritated and it's not just me a few other reviewers have said the same thing too so if you do have sensitive skin i'd recommend you stick to the moisturizing lotion or the cream instead a little bit goes a long way with this one because if you apply too much i find that it can leave a little bit of a film on your skin the good thing though about this packaging especially when you compare it to the moisturizing lotion is that the way that they design this pump makes it really easy to get the exact amount you want out of the bottle so as for the texture it definitely looks a lot more gel like compared to the moisturizing lotion it is a slightly lighter texture i bet that's because there's more water in this formula compared to the moisturizing lotion so in terms of the finish i find that it does leave a little bit of like a light sheen so not total grease ball but like a little bit more of a satiny finish while the lotion sinks in a little bit better and kind of leaves more of a semi matte finish so i think this could be really good for you if you have balanced or combo skin and you want a niacinamide and moisturizer all in one i also think it could work for you if you have oilier skin but i would definitely buy it from somewhere that accepts returns and patch test it first for sure one last thing i wanted to mention with this moisturizer is if you do decide to get it you can absolutely use this during the day too even if it's called pm just don't forget to throw a sunscreen on top okay so moving on to the cerave am moisturizer like the pm moisturizer this also has niacinamide in it and this should be good for all skin types the only info i could find on the concentration of niacinamide in this particular moisturizer was from a reddit post six years ago again i've contacted them and i'll update you all below if they do get back to me on that so between the pm and the am moisturizers the main difference is obviously that this is also a sunscreen with an spf of 30 and broad spectrum protection that's what makes it much better for the daytime if you're just looking for a moisturizer and a sunscreen all in one as a sunscreen it's got a mix of different chemical and physical filters the chemical filters does give it that chemically sunscreen smell which i don't really vibe with and the physical filter in here is a microfine zinc oxide another difference between the am and the pm is that this guy has a parabens in it like the moisturizing lotion while the reformulated version of the serum pm does not so let's look at the texture so it is pretty thick and like really opaque it takes a while to rub it in for the sunscreen to kind of disappear but there's definitely a white cast with this one another thing to note with this is that some people have mentioned that they do get some pilling with it that could be either because they're applying too much or from the dimethicone in the formula so again all of them do have dimethicone in them other than the ultra lightweight moisturizing lotion but you're probably able to see it more with this one because of the white cast all in all i'm not gonna lie i was really disappointed with this one i don't think this is gonna go on my shelf moving on last but not least let's talk about the ultralight moisturizing lotion so this is good if you have combo or oilier skin it probably won't be moisturizing enough on its own if you do have drier skin but don't worry it won't dry out your skin completely because it's still got that ceramide and hyaluronic acid complex so obviously like the am facial moisturizing lotion it also has an spf of 30 and broad spectrum protection what's different is that this is a fully chemical sunscreen while the am also has physical filters in it like the zinc oxide it also means that this will also have that chemically sunscreeny smell i want to talk about the formulation of this for a sec because it's really different from the other four so it does have an ultra lightweight texture to it and it's got a totally different base formulation from the other four but it is still oil-free it's also the only one of the five that doesn't have dimethicone in it so it shouldn't pill and it should work really well under makeup but i know what you're thinking does it have a white cast let's see okay so it does rub in really really well and it just sinks in and disappears into the skin with a matte finish and no white cast i'm not a huge fan of this packaging though because with this clear cap it will look really messy as you continue to use it and also this label kind of just looks like it's been taped on okay so now that we've gone through all that it's time to figure out which is the best one for you if you have dry skin and you really like a rich creamy texture definitely go with the cerave moisturizing cream and try to apply it while your skin is still a little bit damp to really really trap in that moisture and if that's still not enough for you you can get a moisturizer that's even more occlusive and you can try their healing ointment or even slugging with vaseline if your skin is balanced to dry or even combo with some drier spots and you like more of a lighter weight feel to your moisturizer go with the daily moisturizing lotion if your skin is really sensitive or you have eczema stick to either the moisturizing lotion or the cream but if you have balance to oilier skin and you're looking for a moisturizer that also has niacinamide in it both the pm and the am have got that in there but if you're already using a nice cinematic serum that you really love then using either the am or pm moisturizer could be a little bit too much of a good thing and you might want to try using the lotion instead unless you're sensitive to polysorbate 20. as far as sensitivities go if you do have a paraben sensitivity skip the am and the moisturizing lotion the cream the ultra light moisturizing lotion and the pm are paraben free unless you have a really old version of the pm one floating around if you do it's definitely time to throw that one out because that bottle is more than a year old now if you're looking for a sunscreen and moisturizer all in one for the daytime the am has a mix of physical and chemical filters but it has a white cast and it also takes a long time to rub it in the ultra light moisturizing lotion is a fully chemical sunscreen and has no white cast but it might not be moisturizing enough on its own if you do have dry skin remember if you are using them as a sunscreen just apply it 15 minutes before you head out and if you can really try and reapply at least every two hours if you're not a fan of silicones at all then the ultra light moisturizing lotion is the only one of the five that doesn't have any silicones in it but again it's not the base in any of the other four and it's really quite far down the ingredient list oh and if you are going to buy something from therapy don't forget to go to their site to grab a
