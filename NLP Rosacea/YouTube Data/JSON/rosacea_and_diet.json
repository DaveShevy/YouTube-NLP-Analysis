        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry a family physician and in this short video let's talk about the rosacea diet and how to reverse the redness associated with rosacea the redness the scaling the blood vessels are embarrassing over 400 million people on the planet suffer from rosacea and I have a secret to tell you later in this video that you might not believe what if I told you that the cause of your rosacea is not some of the triggers you've been told about but it's actually your diet it's what you've been eating and it's what you've not been eating that's what's causing your rosacea that's what this video is all about now if you know someone suffering from rosacea please take a second and share this video with them so that they will know there is hope and there is a solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at the end of this video watch that playlist and learn how to do Kido right Kido is cheap Kido is easy Kido is very safe very natural it's very nutritious and it's very delicious and it's going to help your rosacea get better than you ever dreamed it would be and then you can save your money that you've been wasting on co-pays with the pills and the gels and the creams and the lotions because you won't need those anymore now everyone who's already reversed their rosacea with a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet I need you to do me a favor in the comments below I need you to tell your story because there'll be people watching this video who will absolutely think I'm kooky and won't believe what I'm saying if you're a newbie to this if you're like there's no way you can reverse my rosacea

        "published_at": "2022-05-05T13:00:03Z",
        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "published_at": "2021-05-02T04:56:07Z",
        "transcript": "all right our viewer question today is um they have asked what are your recommendations for helping get rid of rosacea through a whole food plant-based diet or otherwise oh my we've got to talk about both whole food plant-based diet and otherwise because they're both usually necessary rosacea is such a stubborn and often disfiguring skin condition and you've seen people with uh people probably too young you're very nice to remember an old-time comedian named w.c fields and uh he was a caricature of a man uh but he had this big red bulbous nose uh as part of his trademark and everyone thought he was an alcoholic which he was uh but anyone turned out to me i really had rosacea on his nose there and that's what caused that big bulbous appearance uh the name for that condition is called rhinophyma when rosacea creates that a large bulbous nose appearance but you get rosacea all over your face and other places as well the proper name is acne rosacea and it has some commonalities with acne i think it's made worse by certain foods certainly certainly pro-inflammatory uh meats and sugars seem to play a role here and yanking those out are really important uh whole food plant-based uh underlying whole foods if i had i was flirting with rosacea but there'd be even though they're vegan i wouldn't be eating vegan baked goods and ice creams and and those kind of treats for a number of reasons but again it floods that they're basically sugar and fats and uh usually not terribly healthy for us and most of the vegan processed foods uh the vegan ice creams etc are going to have oils and concentrated sugars so again fall back in those whole plant foods uh you really want to emphasize uh fresh foods you want a big salad every day like dr fuhrman says the salad is the main dish and so have a big cell that's going to be helping your skin in a number of ways [Music] and i think gluten may be playing a role here if i have rosacea can be so disfiguring i would pull out all the stops and one would be to stop eating gluten it clearly plays a role in psoriasis and other skin conditions but i would certainly consider giving myself a say a three to six month break from from gluten um i would stop eating foods that might increase gut permeability this will call leaky gut stop drinking alcohol stop taking ibuprofen you might want to stop chlorinated drinking water or at least get a water distiller or something you want to be nice to your microbiome down down your gut there and chlorine the drinking water can uh can reduce it and again this is if you're flirting with uh with a rosacea outbreak you if you're if your skin is healthy and healthy person you know it's okay just to drink filtered water like we have in our house but if you've got a condition where a healthy gut wall is absolutely essential i'd even consider getting a water distiller or reverse osmosis to get the chlorine out of the water so all of these things are meant to really increase the purity if you will of the food stream when any supplements help i would consider taking some extra zinc 15 to 30 milligrams of zinc in a supplement and here's a place where you really want to make sure your skin oils are as beneficial as possible so we're talking about those good omega-3 fats so uh every morning uh we've got a draw in our fridge got a jar of ground up uh flax chia and hemp seeds a couple of tablespoons of that goes on my oatmeal every morning goes on a salad in the evening i'll crush up a handful of walnuts and that goes on my salads and soups every day so i want lots of omega-3 fats in my skin oils so as far as diet wise goes those are the main considerations now there seems to be an infections component to this and there are skin bacterias certain strains of staphylococcus and streptococcus get down into the hair follicles and cause infection and i think that really needs to be dealt with as well so we talked about whole food planting style and other things among the other things is uh this is such a challenging to be nice uh skin condition can be devastating now i would i put out all the stops and now we know that some topical antibiotic agents something like metronidazole gel these clear gels i get down into the skin pores and kill off the bacteria and really can be beneficial so here's where a visit or two to a skilled dermatologist to get a prescription and some guidance yeah you don't need to go and drag yourself into their office every week but get to get an assessment and get a prescription for one of these topical antibiotic gels i'm hesitant these days to prescribe oral antibiotics for this they can be helpful but for the damage you made due to your microbiome i really prefer that people try to deal with this topically so get on that healthy whole food plant-based diet take a little extra zinc uh make sure those omega-3 fats in your diet this might be a place for say six months if you're a young person of some algae derived dha to get more of that into your skin oils but find your local dermatologist to give you a prescription for these topical gels and with little luck you'll see that rosacea fade away and uh you can smile at that person smiling back at you in the mirror and get out your life with healthy skin i hope that helps hi everyone dr michael clapper here announcing our new format for our q a with dr k andy hagen will be asking me one question that's been sent in by our viewers so if you want to see if your question is getting answered do join us for our q a with dr k right here hope to see you then",

suffer from\u00a0\nthis condition and over 415 million people\u00a0\u00a0 worldwide rosacea is a skin condition\u00a0\nthat causes redness in the face primarily\u00a0\u00a0 the cheek area the nose the chin in the forehead\u00a0\nyou feel like you're blushing all the time\u00a0\u00a0 and the exact cause of rosacea is\u00a0\nstill unknown what happens is the blood\u00a0\u00a0 rushes to the surface of the skin causing\u00a0\nthe skin to heat up and then become inflamed\u00a0\u00a0 and that's really the clue here the clue is\u00a0\nthat heat is causing skin to become inflamed\u00a0\u00a0 and therefore knowing that acknowledging that\u00a0\nand thinking what can I do to keep my skin cool\u00a0\u00a0 and calm and that's what you need to find\u00a0\nout is there a connection between your gut\u00a0\u00a0 and rosacea scientists are researching this link\u00a0\nbetween your gut microbiome and rosacea we know\u00a0\u00a0 that we have got microorganisms in our gut we\u00a0\nknow this and we know that they affect our health\u00a0\u00a0 now the British journal of dermatology has found\u00a0\nthat people with gastrointestinal problems like\u00a0\u00a0 Ibs usually also suffer from rosacea can change in\u00a0\nyour diet really affect and help your rosacea yes\u00a0\u00a0 so we know that everyone with rosacea has got\u00a0\ncertain triggers certain foodstuffs and drinks\u00a0\u00a0 that aggravate their skin condition we know that\u00a0\nbut there is proof now that probiotics, taking\u00a0\u00a0 probiotics can absolutely reduce your rosacea\u00a0\nsymptoms so probiotics we get them from yogurt\u00a0\u00a0 and from food supplements and they are known\u00a0\nas the happy healthy good bacteria and when we take\u00a0\u00a0 probiotics they restore the balance of good\u00a0\nbacteria or the gut bacteria and that will\u00a0\u00a0 impact on your rosacea reducing it and also\u00a0\nit is known to help irritable bowel syndrome\u00a0\u00a0 how do you identify what foods stuffs and drinks\u00a0\nare causing you or aggravating your flare-ups\u00a0\u00a0 of rosacea what's triggering your rosacea keep\u00a0\na food diary I think that's a great way to go\u00a0\u00a0 get a notepad and start writing down when you have\u00a0\nflare-ups what foods you were eating at that time\u00a0\u00a0 so you know we know that there'll be certain\u00a0\ntriggers that's aggravating you could it could even be chocolate for example um it's really\u00a0\nrotten isn't it you can't eat any more chocolate but you really have to look at that what's\u00a0\ncausing it and eliminating it from your diet\u00a0\u00a0 and thinking knowing that rosacea is an\u00a0\ninflammatory skin condition that's probably\u00a0\u00a0 the key words there so you need to be looking at\u00a0\nanti-inflammatory food lists and focusing on them\u00a0\u00a0 and getting them into your your daily nutrition\u00a0\nyour daily diet so foods that can trigger rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 okay listen up to this spicy foods hot spices\u00a0\nlike papika cumin cayenne or black pepper\u00a0\u00a0 dairy yogurt cheese and sour cream sugar always\u00a0\na culprit for skin but particularly rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and sugar causes this inflammation in the skin\u00a0\nalcohol particularly red wine champagne and beer\u00a0\u00a0 hot drinks including tea coffee and hot chocolate\u00a0\nI really hate to tell you about all those things\u00a0\u00a0 but you really have to give it a big go be\u00a0\nstrong and eliminate those from the diet\u00a0\u00a0 and you will see your skin changing\u00a0\nyou will see it changing I promise\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea diet I want you to think about this nuts\u00a0\nand berries leafy greens and whole grains lentils\u00a0\u00a0 asparagus and kale highly pigmented fruits and\u00a0\nvegetables such as sweet potato and broccoli\u00a0\u00a0 fatty fish such as wild salmon which is\u00a0\ngreat and mackerel and chia and flax seeds and that secret diet I want you to really have a\u00a0\nlook at and there's really great guys on youtube\u00a0\u00a0 talking about Dr Ken Berry and Dr Eric Berg\u00a0\nthe keto diet looking at that and that will\u00a0\u00a0 definitely change your skin and we will get rid\u00a0\nof your rosacea so looking at that I hope that was\u00a0\u00a0 informative to you thank you so much for watching\u00a0\nto the end please don't forget to subscribe\u00a0\u00a0 and hit that notification button if I\u00a0\nget another great idea to chat about something\u00a0\u00a0 you'll be the first to know and thank you again\u00a0\nfor watching have a

        "transcript": "hi everyone this lesson is on what to avoid if you have rosaceous we're going to talk about certain emotional factors environmental factors and certain dietary factors that can actually worsen signs and symptoms of rosacea in this lesson before we talk about those exacerbating factors let's talk about what rosacea is so rosacea is a chronic inflammatory in autoimmune condition involving recurrent episodes of skin lesions on the face and the signs and symptoms of rosacea includes telling giac Pages erythema reddening of the face papules and pustules as well and the pathophysiology of rosacea is not entirely understood but there does seem to be a genetic or family history component of this that is an important risk factor the topic of this lesson is that there are certain factors and some of these includes foods and Beverages and some environmental factors that can exacerbate symptoms of rosacea we're going to talk about those as we go through this lesson before we talk about those exasperating factors I want to briefly talk about the pathophysiology of this condition because it's going to better help us understand those exacerbating or triggering factors so the pathophysiology of rosacea is going to be due to this regulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning and issues with vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels vasodilation is dilation of blood vessels so with regards to the dysregulation of innate in adaptive immune functioning this is due to increased expression of a particular cell receptor in that cell respect is known as toll-like receptor 2 so there's increased expression and activation of this receptor that leads to dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning with regards to the vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels they seems to be due to an increased release of vasoactopeptides also due to increased expression inactivation of trpv receptors including trpv1 two and four so trpv stands for transient receptor potential vanilloid so it's transient receptor potential vanilloid or trpv one two and four but some other trpvs can also be implicated as well but these are the ones we're going to talk about in this lesson and then another important receptor that can lead to issues with the pathophysiology in this condition includes a receptor called transient receptor potential anchorin one or trpa1 receptor so there's increased expression and activation of this receptor as well and along with this there is activation of what we call an inflammasome so an inflammasome has the same implies is involved in inflammatory processes so the triggers I'm going to talk about as we go through this lesson are actually going to activate some of these receptors and this is the reason why I want to talk with the pathophysiology here let's talk about the things that should be avoided the triggers of rosacea one of them is going to be stress and this is going to be emotional stress and emotional stress can actually exacerbate symptoms of rosacea via activation of trpv1 receptor so it's going to be important to reduce your stress another thing that can trigger rosacea symptoms is sunlight or UV exposure or ultraviolet light exposure so sunlight exposure or ultraviolet light exposure worsen symptoms through activation of tlr2 and trpv4 receptors so in order to reduce ultraviolet light induced activation of these receptors it would be good to wear sunscreen or try to avoid sunlight as much as possible if you have rosacea some other triggers includes alcohol so alcohol can trigger symptoms of rosacea via activation of tlr2 and trpv-1 Pathways and in some alcohol beverages is even worse because there are higher levels of histamine in certain alcoholic beverages like wine and this histamine can actually cause vasodilation so wine or more specifically red wine can lead to not only activation of tlr2 and trpv1 Pathways but also increase the vasodilation because it has higher levels of histamine it's a histamine-rich beverage so it would be best to avoid alcohol and especially red wine now hot liquids can also trigger rosacea as well and it's actually going to be the heat from the hot liquids that can actually trigger rosacea so excessive heat from hot liquids and from weather and we'll talk about this later on can actually activate trpv one and two receptors so be best to wait for hot beverages like hot tea or coffee to cool down before drinking it another important trigger of rosacea is eating spicy food and specifically Chili Peppers or other spices that contain capsaicin so capsaicin is the chemical that actually causes us to feel that burning sensation when we eat spicy food so it actually activates heat receptors and the heat receptor in the mouth is actually trpv1 so trpv1 in the mouth activation of this receptor actually leads to us having the sensation of a burning sensation and this is the same receptor that is activated by those hot liquids we just talked about in activation of trpv1 receptors in the mouth again causes that burning sensation but then itself because it's activating trpv1 and there's increased expression of that receptor in rosacea this can actually trigger rosacea symptoms in those patients so it'd be best to avoid or reduce your consumption of spicy food now cheese can also be another important dietary factor that can worsen rosacea cheese is itself a histamine-rich food and along with this also processed meats or histamine rich as well and as I mentioned before with regards to red wine histamine can cause vasodilation worsening the redness and flushing symptoms so it'd be best to avoid cheese and processed Meats chocolate is also another important trigger of rosacea chocolate contains something called cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde actually activates trpa1 or transient receptor potential anchoring one two exasperate symptoms of rosacea and chocolate itself also triggers the release of histamine so it's something that can actually both activate trpa1 but also lead to the release of histamine from other cells so it'd be best to actually try to avoid eating or at least reduce your consumption of chocolate tomatoes can also trigger rosace in some patients as well and again it's because tomatoes also contain cinnamaldehyde and again as we just learned cinnamaldehyde activates trpa1 and tomatoes like chocolate can actually trigger the release of histamine as well so again try to avoid eating tomatoes if that happens to be a trigger for you significant temperature changes can also be another potential trigger as well so significant heat or cold we talked about the heat from hot liquids being a potential trigger and cold exposure can also be a potential trigger as well heat exposure specifically again activates trpv1 and two and cold weather activates trpa1 so again it'd be best to try to either put on good clothing when you're out in very cold weather and try to avoid too much heat exposure both of these can help to reduce the triggering of rosacea symptoms there can be some other weather effects as well that can lead to an exacerbation of rosacea symptoms and this includes wind exposure so wind blowing on the face can actually lead to activation of some of those receptors we talked about before and humidity humidity actually activates trpv4 and then exercise can also be another trigger for some some patients so especially heavy or rigorous exercise this can actually lead to activation of tlr2 and trpv1 Pathways and there are some medications and supplements that can trigger rosacea symptoms and these include beta blockers topical steroids and vitamin B3 or niacin supplementation niacin can cause flushing but in patients with rosacea can be even worse so these are some other potential triggers for rosacea flare-ups so the triggers we talked about in this lesson are not going to affect everybody some patients will have some triggers some patients will have other triggers but knowing the most common triggers can help you think about and be aware of what may be triggering your potential flare-ups of rosacea so triggers you find that are causing your rosacea symptoms you can avoid those if you want more information on rosacea please check out my full in-depth lesson on this topic as we talk about more of the pathysiology the signs symptoms and how it's diagnosed and treated in that lesson if you found this lesson novel please like And subscribe for more lessons like this one and as always

Burke here in this video we're gonna talk about rosacea okay rosacea is a condition where you have these red and cheeks could be in the forehead the chin pimples it looks like it's like a spider vein broken blood vessels all right now if you look this up in the medical literature you're gonna find it's an unknown cause right so let's talk about some common factors relating to rosacea okay number one a lot of women get it after menopause okay what does that mean well the adrenal gland backs up the ovaries during menopause and the adrenal glands store a lot of the vitamin C in the body and vitamin C deficiency you have all sorts of issues with bleeding gums spider veins vascular issues weakness within the arteries leaky gut because vitamin C supports the integrity of the collagen so you can have a vitamin C deficiency coming from an adrenal weakness okay that's number one number two medically it's treated with antibiotics and there's some results with that so there has to be some type of microbial issue going on so the other medication you use is an anti-inflammatory so we have microbes and inflammation guess what the adrenal controls the white blood cells so that does control the immune system and it produces most of the anti-inflammatories in your body as well like prednisone is a type of cortisol that's to be used for inflammation a lot of women get rosacea after mold exposure which again is some microbe that inactivates the white blood cell so again we have an immune issue that's underlying things there's also higher incidence of mites and small intestine bacterial overgrowth so we have this microbial imbalance in your gut which again that's where a lot of your immune system is okay so I believe that it's a combination between an immune weakness caused by some micro probably mold in combination with weak adrenals okay so here's the two things I'm going to recommend and that's them okay you can get this anywhere online or a health food store which is a real good anti-inflammatory and grapefruit seed extract which is one of the best anti mult antifungal antibacterial natural things that you can take so thank you so much for watching and your comments below hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you a report",

type symptoms uh and when you do some testing for that and you treat it that oftentimes will clear up their uh their rosacea [Music] [Applause] welcome to the doctor's pharmacy i'm dr mark hyman that's pharmacy with an f-f-a-r-m-a-c-y a place for conversations that matter and if you've got skin problems you should listen up because this conversation is going to matter to you particularly something called rosacea acne rosacea it's a terrible skin condition we'll talk about what it is but if you have it you know what i'm talking about and it is miserable and today we have with us none other than dr todd lepin who's my colleague a frequent guest here on the special episode of the doctor's pharmacy the house call episode he's a graduate of dartmouth medical school he's board certified internal medicine we've worked together for decades now it's almost 10 non three decades it's kind of scary holy cow you don't look any different than the day i met you so functional must be working uh he is an incredible guy and his teachers all over the world well not so much anymore but you know virtually now actually and and has been uh as part of the faculty in the institute for functional medicine uh american college of advancement of medicine age management medicine and many many other great great organizations so todd welcome back to the doctor's pharmacy thank you mark okay so first of all we're talking about this weird condition that some people never heard of called acne rosacea we're going to talk about what it is how traditional medicine deals with it why that's all wrong and how we approach it using functional medicine so what is acne rosacea okay well that's acne rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition that adults get it's also another name for it is adult acne and patients who have it will get redness to the face usually over the the cheeks and the nose sometimes the chin and you can also be pretty severe you can get uh telangiectasias which are like little uh blood vessels there's like little like blood lines in your face vasodilation of the blood vessels papules pustules so it looks like adult acne is really what it is and interestingly it's fairly common about ten percent of the population has it uh it tends to be more common in people who have celtic origin so irish scottish uh english which is interesting i'll talk about that later i'm jewish from the middle east i'm safe yeah it might be absolutely it might be it might be yeah um and uh a lot of famous people have actually had this uh bill clinton yeah has won uh wc fields uh and bulbus yeah so one of the complications of rosacea is chronic inflammatory changes to the skin so you can get what's called rhinophyma which is basically when you see a clown with the red nose that's rhinophyma yeah that's what right red nose and it can be actually quite debilitating i mean when it gets really really bad you can uh get this distortion of the facial features especially over the nose yeah yeah so it's this really nasty kind of acne and it's what's what triggers it do we know from a traditional medicine point of view well there are a variety of different triggers when people have rosacea uh things that can trigger it are spicy foods uh alcohol can do it yeah i mean alcoholics tend to get this a lot right if you're an alcoholic and wc feels clearly was yeah yeah if those of you who don't know he has google it yeah that's probably before your time but it's it it is often driven by alcohol yeah and i i i my own theory on alcohol as it ties in with that is that alcohol does vasodilate blood vessels but also alcohol in excess is also a big contributor to leaky gut and i always you know i get my patients to understand this uh concept that alcohol can promote leaky gut so i took a shot of tequila and i threw it in your eye what would happen it would burn your eye would water right you're able to get leaky you have leaky eye leaky gut so chronic alcohol ingestion is probably one of the biggest things for low-grade endotoxin and leaky gut and that's also tied in as we'll talk about uh in terms of irritable bowel and yeah we're going to get into leaky gut because that is it's a very big issue general and particularly with things like skin disorders like acne rosacea yeah yeah exactly so so todd um you know in functional medicine we we take a very different view which is we treat things from the inside out not the outside in right dermatology is all about lotions potions and creams and slathering stone on your face to sort of get it good from the outside in but it's kind of it's kind of backwards yeah so what what are the traditional treatments for rosacea and why are they not the best idea you know when i went through my medical training there was an old uh saying that the dermatologist basically if it's if it's dry wet it if it's wet moisturize it and if you don't know what's going on give it a steroid that's that's essentially pretty much right that's pretty much dermatology i learned the same lesson yeah right that's that's that's it and you know dermatology and if if it's wet dry it if it's dry wet it and if you don't know give it a stir exactly that's that's that's the the mantra of the modern uh uh dermatologist um but again it's like you said it's it's it's an external manifestation of something going on internally uh so the question is is what's driving this and uh in in preparing for this talk i mean i've i've seen so many patients with rosacea it's not funny but what do they put on there they give antibiotics on the face yeah they'll give like give like uh uh you know metronidazole cream uh which is topical uh uh anti uh antibiotics it's like an antiparasite antibiotic yeah one of the newer one of the newer medications and this is sort of an interesting thing is a is a cream called ivermectin so this sort of blew me away because this is relatively new and i think we were talking about it it's a worm pill it's a it's a parasite uh they're using it for covet even really yeah yeah yeah so so it's really it was it so it said to my so i i i was reading and i had actually had a patient who came in and was on the ivermectin cream and was doing very very well on the ivermectin cream and then i said to myself well how is an anti-parasitic medication topically helping with uh words yeah well it's also that's also interesting because one of the things that uh is strongly tied in with uh uh rosacea now remember rosacea is just over the face it's it's it's this facial manifestation of an internal uh issue is that we have these little creepy crawlers on our face and they're called uh mites skin mites yeah uh uh uh dermadecks like dust mites we all have them we there everybody has these and the interesting thing is that patients who have rosacea have a much much higher density of skin mites on them for whatever reason and normally they they basically they're like little uh you call them like little parasites that they're ectoparasites and they sit on the skin and they they eat your dead tissues and they they uh eat off of the oils on the on the glands and normally you don't have a reaction to them they're sort of like a benign parasite but in some people who have high concentrations of these skin mites the body makes a very very high immune response to it so uh getting back to the ivermectin which is basically an anti-anti-parasitic it may be actually working as an anti-parasitic for some of these skin mites yeah so maybe there's an infectious cause to this yeah so yeah so yeah so the things they use are menocycline which is an antibiotic flagella or metronidazole which isn't any parasite an antibiotic every mechanin which is an anti-worm oh oral oral doxocycle is another one yeah oral antibiotics which probably is a really bad idea given yeah exactly you have a microbiome you don't want to be killing it to fix your skin exactly exactly yeah and why that why might that minicycline work why might antibiotics orally work well there's a there's a thought and there's actually it's actually in the literature is that uh small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also one of the triggers for rosacea a lot of patients that you see with rosacea will have irritable bowel type symptoms or bloating type symptoms and when you do some testing for that and you treat it that oftentimes will clear up their uh their rosacea yeah um yeah absolutely yeah so i think i think you know we're not averse to using topicals and topical medication when necessary but if you really focus on root causes which is what functional medicine does you come up with a very different set of approaches that actually works better is longer lasting and doesn't require to keep putting on lotions potions and creams for the rest of your life or taking oral antibiotics right exactly and then the way getting back to the ivermectin ivermectin and i uh in preparing for this talk i did some little a little bit of research and the patients who are more prone towards uh rosacea have a problem with too much of what's called uh the catholic side and antimicrobial peptides so these are these mouthful yeah they called camps camp uh catholicism and antimicrobial peptides and these peptides are part of the built-in innate part of the immune system to protect our skin against various types of infections and it turns out that ivermectin actually uh helps with these uh these antimicrobial peptides because people who have rosacea have too much of these peptides they have like an over uh uh robust response to uh antimicrobials so it's it's thought that the uh one of the it's actually a breakdown products called ll-37 and uh ivermectin actually works on dampening down these uh antimicrobial peptides to decrease inflammation in the skin okay so in terms of in terms of the cause it seems to be a combination of internal and external factors right something on the skin and then some things internally but from traditional medicine there really isn't an approach to helping heal the skin from the inside out no no no and whether you have acne or eczema or psoriasis or rosacea or any one of the myriad skin conditions that we get most of them have their root cause inside not on the topical level exactly and and often it's the gut yeah absolutely yeah so you mentioned a little bit earlier leaky gut so take us through from a functional medicine perspective are thinking about the root causes what are what are the things that you think about when someone comes in your office and their face is all red and they've got all this acne on there and they've got like little intel injectation these little red lines everywhere and you can see the blood vessels dilated and they're kind of looking like uh santa claus yeah exactly yeah and also they get they also get photosensitivity too which is the other the other thing and the interesting they can't go in the sun without getting it worse and and that that also ties in with these uh antimicrobial peptides because uh it's thought it's theorized that the the the celts the ones who live in the higher northern uh latitudes they don't get as much sun as we do so it's thought that from an evolutionary standpoint that they benefit by having this they have a more robust immune system when there's not enough sunshine and and sunshine will actually activate this this innate immune system and that's why sun exposure oftentimes makes it worse because they produce more of these antimicrobial peptides and then those antimicrobial peptides have to get processed and in the process of uh breaking them apart the immune system then starts responding to it so that's why there's a sort of a photosensitivity aspect to it and what are the other sort of things you think about when someone comes to your office with rosacea well uh one of the things i oftentimes look at is their vitamin d levels uh vitamin d is is is part of the uh immune system and it uh it's tied in with uh intimately with the antimicrobial peptides system in the body so oftentimes patients who have this have low vitamin d levels uh we'll look at the microbiome testing to see if there's any evidence of dysbiosis bacterial overgrowth testing the sibo testing checking for hydrogen and methane i mean probably the majority of patients who i see of rosacea have problems with with bacterial overgrowth other thing is low stomach acid which also promotes and contributes to bacterial overgrowth yeah so checking for the patients uh sometimes these patients are also on ppis uh acid blocking acid blocking medications absolutely yep yeah because we have acid in our stomach to help us to digest food it's also there to decrease uh the amount of bacteria higher up in the colon so uh it's good it's good to have stomach acid yeah it says if you don't have stomach acid then the ph of your small intestine changes becomes more alkaline and then bugs grow in there that wouldn't necessarily grow yeah and that's when you get this overgrowth of bad bugs in there and it it can be what we call sibo which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where bad bugs migrate up from the lower intestine into the small intestine and then when you eat foods you get bloating distension it causes leaky gut you end up causing damage to the lining of the gut and food particles and bacterial toxins leak in and create inflammation throughout the body and on the skin so you know leaky gut can cause hundreds of different manifestations one of which is rosacea and unless you think about that and learn how to treat it you may not be able to be successful with it there's also another condition that i've seen todd in a lot of my patients called sifo sifo small intestinal fungal overgrowth and a lot of people talk about it as candida but there's many many species of yeast and fungus and and so what i found often is that treating the gut through addressing the bacterial overgrowth the yeast overgrowth healing leaky gut dealing with the food sensitivities makes a profound impact yeah and a lot of times it is food sensitivities that can trigger i mean for example gluten we've talked about on the show that is one of the biggest drivers of leaky gut yeah and even even if you are not celiac and even if you don't think you have any symptoms or don't notice any symptoms when you eat gluten dr alessia fasano who's the world's expert at harvard on gluten he said everybody who eats gluten creates some level of leaky gut right now most people kind of handle it right transient leaky gut exactly so i don't know like it's probably not a good idea to eat that much gluten because of the potential to create leaky gut and how that is linked to so many chronic diseases including weight gain diabetes cancer heart disease alzheimer's autoimmune diseases allergies act i mean you just name it depression all this stuff is connected by by leaky gut so i really i think you know getting a very different thinking about this is key and you you did you talked about the stomach acid you talked about the acid blockers you talked about maybe other things that that you know are relevant in the gut and certain infections like h pylori which is a common bacteria that causes ulcers also has been linked to h pylori and food sensitivities hey everybody it's dr hyman thanks for tuning in to the doctor's pharmacy i hope you're loving this podcast it's one of my favorite things to do and introducing you all the experts that i know and i love and that i've learned so much from and i want to tell you about something else i'm doing which is called mark's picks it's my weekly newsletter and in it i share my favorite stuff from foods to supplements to gadgets to tools to enhance your health it's all the cool stuff that i use and that my team uses to optimize and enhance our health and i'd love you to sign up for the weekly newsletter i'll only send it to you once a week on fridays nothing else i promise and all you do is go to drhymen.com forward slash pics to sign up that's drhyman.com forward slash picks p-i-c-k-s and sign up for the newsletter and i'll share with you my favorite stuff that i use to enhance my health and get healthier and better and live younger longer now back to this week's episode so how do we approach these patients when they come in what are the kinds of things that we would do from a diagnostic point of view that you wouldn't get when you went to the dermatologist well from a diagnostic standpoint uh again i would do testing for um you know uh leaky gut that would do intestinal permeability testing checking for antibodies to zonulin with the cyrex testing that we do cyrex array number three so that's basically there's a test that we do at the center for uh at the ultra wellness center here in lenox massachusetts where we're recording live is uh cyrex testing it's a lab that looks at antibodies that you produce against these proteins that are in your gut that come from gluten or even from bacteria and so if you're creating a lot of antibodies to these proteins it's clear that they're getting across the lining of your gut leaking into your bloodstream and causing an immune response which is not only local but systemic right and and i and there are there are other ways you can actually measure zonulin in the blood and you can measure it also in the stool and that's only like a snapshot in time so you can develop leaky gut for you know a couple hours or a day or so but if it if it stops then you're all so fine the antibodies against zonulin is the one that tells you that there's this chronic leaky gut which is really more valuable because if i gave you a shot at tequila then you know an hour later measure your zone it's going to go up okay where's the tequila that sounds good right so so that's why i think that the uh the the testing for the antibodies against uh zonulin is even more valuable in these patients with chronic conditions uh and what other kinds of tests besides the the uh the zonulin and the lipopolysaccharide test that we do to look at the antibodies against these proteins in the gut that come from a leaky gut we'll do the uh the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where we'll measure the production of fermentation products so hydrogen and methane are gases that are normally produced in the body when people have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth those will be produced at higher levels so we can check that and over time i think the test that we do is a three hour test so you measure baseline hydrogen methane check it at uh intervals of about every half hour and you do that over three hour time period that can tell you definitively do or do you not have uh bacterial overgrowth and how bad is it and is it predominantly hydrogen or is it methyl so what you're saying is that is that when we eat foods you know humans don't produce gas it's the bacteria that are fermenting the foods we eat that produce the gas so absolutely bloated or distended or you're passing gas it's not you you can blame it on the bugs but but the problem is that we don't know how to regulate the bucks bugs and get a healthier ecosystem and that and that is what what most physicians never were trained to do yeah and it's the foundation of functional medicine it's the foundation of our practice here at the ultra chobano center where we really dig into these issues and we look at bacterial overgrowth we look at fungal overgrowth we look at a leaky gut we look at food sensitivities we'll do other testing look at whether you're reacting to gluten or dairy or eggs or other foods and it's really helpful in drilling down on what's really going on with people absolutely yeah and that you know we're talking basically producing gases that's basically a fermentation process and normally fermentation happens lower in the colon that's in the in the colonic area the ant when they it's more of an uh uh what's an anaerobic environment or a lack of oxygen and that's normal for that to be happening but when that process is taking place higher up in a different neighborhood it's not a good thing yeah and i mean you want your upper intestine to be sterile and they're mostly sterile mostly sterile and when and all that bacteria migrates up there it's just a bad situation and when we take acid blockers when we you know are low in magnesium which half of us are when we're under stress and our gut motility is slow when we uh you know taking lots of antibiotics and screws up our whole system in there you know all these are reasons why we get these bacterial overgrowth issues and they're super common and they're easy relatively easy to treat with functional medicine now the other thing we do is look at stool testing right so we look at not just the the proteins from leaky gut or we look at the food sensitivities or bacterial overgrowth gas production but we actually look at the poop yeah so what do we what are we looking for in the poop that helps us figure out what's going on well there's a lot of things uh you know there's gold in there uh there yeah it really is it's uh golden them there hills yeah so a lot of uh information can be uh determined by doing a microbial analysis so you can look at the overall balance of bacteria so there are you know everybody's got hundreds of different kinds of bacteria in the in the gi tract and we can measure those using dna pcr analysis and do we can do quantitative we can measure how many uh there are of each different species look at ones that are normally found look at ones that are found in the gut but normally they want to be at low levels look at bacteria that are associated with autoimmunity so things like citrobacter klebsiella salmonella yeah etc uh we can look at now analyze uh for uh yeast overgrowth various forms of yeast um and then also microbial markers of inflammation things like calprotectin looking for fat so you can get a lot of time functioning enzyme function uh butyrate uh checking for beauty chain factors fatty acids indicators of healthy ecosystems so you know todd what you're what you're saying is that you know traditional sort of microbiome testing they just look at the the genetic material of the the microbiome and they can't really test everything although they can do some really extraordinary tests now but there are kits out there where you can look at your microbiome but it it's far more than just what bugs you have in there it's what they're doing yeah so we look at the the result the function on the ecosystem we look like you said the enzyme function you're absorbing your food is your inflammation are you having good bugs in there that are producing the the super fuel for the gut these short chain fatty acids that are so important oh you do have the right balance i've got are you missing some key bugs you have overgrowth of bad bugs you have yeast you have parasites and it's such a much more comprehensive stool test that we do here at the ultra wellness center we were talking earlier about delta sleep and the interesting thing is is that when you have good bugs in the in the digestive tract and you're eating in a fiber in your diet and you're producing higher levels of butyrate that has an effect on the brain and also improves uh uh sleep that's amazing yeah yeah so you have to have your get your poop together to sleep better i got it okay that's the same that's a good good strategy it's better than taking the ambien yeah um all right so we also look at uh you know other things like omega-3 fats and and other fats because a lot of uh inflammation can come from not having the right balance of fat absolutely in your body yep yeah um and and i think you know so so when you have a patient come in what are the what are the steps you would take initially to treat a patient with rosacea from a functional medicine perspective you know the again taking the history is the big one you know um i always will ask people what's your ethnic background a lot of people say you know i'm white you know it's like you know are you irish english german jewish russian whatever because the rosacea is typically found in in light-skinned fair-skinned people and from a genetic standpoint they are the ones who are more likely to have that it's just an interesting part to know to have in terms of the history and then i'll just ask them you know what is it you're eating are you eating a standard american diet uh how much alcohol are you drinking um how much stress do you have stress also caffeine yeah caffeine can play right yeah those are those are all things which can sort of you know it's like adding gasoline to the fire uh because literally rosacea is the skin on fire in the in the in the uh in the facial area but um doing the testing for essential fatty acids making sure that um uh they have the right balance of the essential fats in their diet a lot of people uh are have too much omega-6 which tends to be more pro-inflammatory yeah lack of the omega 3s one of the oils i don't know if you've used it that i found it very helpful with um patients who have rosacea is uh porridge oil and even criminals oil yeah they tend to be very they help to dampen down that inflammatory resistance that's a very key omega-6 that people don't think about much but it's called gamma linolenic acid which is a very powerful anti-inflammatory it's not like the omega-3s but it's sort of like the omega-3s but on the omega-6 side exactly and it and it's something we really have a hard time getting in our diet it's like borage oil and you know a few other things but evening primrose oil so yeah that's very powerful i agree and i also think that you know um when i see these patients i also think about looking for other clues like do they have yeast issues have they been in lots of antibiotics are they on acid blockers which cause yeast overgrowth yeah do they have other fungal issues dandruff do they have anal itching do they have thrush or a white coating in their tongue uh you know do they have vaginal yeast infections do they have other skin markers of use like little tinea or other kinds of things so you'll see often a pattern of other issues around fungal stuff i'll check for h pylori i'll check again all the tests we did talk about and and see what's really going on and then and then you know from the treatment point of view um you know you start with an elimination diet with an anti-inflammatory diet right exactly yeah put it putting patients on an anti-inflammatory elimination diet you know eighty percent of the time doesn't matter what they come in with they're gonna actually they'll actually get better they you know getting them off of the pro-inflammatory foods uh and then putting in foods which are uh anti-inflammatory uh cold water fish sardines wild salmon um uh the essential oils like uh evening primrose oil helped to sort of dampen down that inflammatory response yeah i agree i think you know we don't understand most of us how powerful food is as medicine and how it can drive tremendous amounts of inflammation throughout the body and you know obviously if it's on your skin it's visible but there's also invisible inflammation that you're not seeing that's driving all the chronic diseases yeah and is that you actually just you just you triggered a thought because there's actually a paper that says if you have rosacea you have a higher instance of alzheimer's disease oh wow so it's not just it's not just a you know a cosmetic issue it's actually systemic it's a rich face and a red brain that's on fire exactly yeah is that yeah that's i i was sort of blown away by that that's fascinating yeah especially in women it's actually more more common in women so so you you know you advise people the obvious things cut out the alcohol the caffeine stay away from the sun it's away from spicy foods but we also sell them stereo from gluten which triggers leaky gut often dairy you you you actually add in all the anti-inflammatory foods that are important though all the phytochemicals from plant foods and turmeric and ginger and garlic and rosemary and all these powerful foods that can really help to reduce inflammation and and then we often directly treat the issues that are going on it could be leaky gut so we give them a gut repair program this could be fungal or bacterial overgrowth so we'll we'll take care of those with either herbs or antibiotics or any fungals and you'll see these patients really dramatically improve when they change their diet and they resort their gut and incentives will use like things like even primrose oil i found the digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid absolutely often are really helpful too yeah i've been so i've been surprised at how many people have a what i would call a relative lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach i i was a venture to say that you know the majority of people don't have too much acid that have not enough acid in the stomach yeah well that's interesting because the third leading category of drugs are the acid blockers like prolossic and prevacid and pepsi pepsi and all these other drugs these uh nexium mass effects i mean they're just like out there everywhere and now they're now they're over the counter and everybody exactly yeah i mean i i just i we've talked about this before in the podcast but when i was in medical school the drug reps came in because it's drugs that just come out and they're like listen guys these guys these drugs work they're they're great uh they will help people with ulcers if they're really bad you don't want to keep anybody on it for more than six weeks right those are huge stomach acid it's really bad long term these are the drug reps telling us this and now it's like people are on it for decades and it causes b12 deficiency magnesium deficiency zinc deficiency osteoporosis osteoporosis pneumonia bacterial overgrowth irritable bowel syndrome when you get rid of your heartburn but you get all the other problems yeah it's yeah that's that's amazing and then it's one of those drugs it's so it's so sneaky because it's addictive once you get on it it's hard to get off it because it it causes this rebound so absolutely when you suppress the stomach acid and you stop the drug the acid production goes crazy exactly which makes you feel horrible and then you go i need the drug but you can actually taper it down and use other strategies to help people get off it and you bring it you bring up a really good point because a lot of the the pharmaceutical medications especially some of the psychotropic so the antidepressants are like that too uh the the ppis and the antidepressants when you try to get off of them you get this rebound process the body tries to get back into balance and it's it can be very difficult so you've got to go low and slow when you're trying to taper off the ppis or taper off uh antidepressant psychotropic meds absolutely amazing so so what what cases have you recalled about rosacea that you want to share that can give you a sense yeah well i i had a patient who came in and um she was a undiagnosed celiac not just a gluten sensitivity she was undiagnosed uh celiac um she was irish and she was having a standard american diet and she was self-medicating for her heartburn with over-the-counter uh acid blocking medications it had a lot of bloating type symptoms and came in uh and you know her her major complaint was her skin but you know she had all these other things but her big thing was you know it's how i look right so you know it's it's you know people are vain and people get people's attention exactly right and and then when i uh did a dive into uh her testing you know it turned out that she was deficient in her essential fatty acids especially the gamma linoleic acid um she she had lack of stomach acid because of the ppis you can actually measure a test blood test is a commercially available test called gastrin and gastrin levels will go up when you block acid um so and that's actually one of the tests that i actually like to use when i have patients when i'm trying to get them off of a ppi because the higher the gastrin level the more difficult it will be to get off the ppi uh and that's sort of like it'll tell you how easy uh you can use blockers exactly and then uh she also had uh low vitamin d levels i mean you know we spend a lot of our time clothed and indoors so we don't get enough way enough enough sunshine uh that's that's one of the big things and low vitamin d you don't just fix low vitamin d this is one of my i get up on my soapbox all the time with here is you don't just fix low vitamin d by taking vitamin d now vitamin d deficiency is basically a sunshine deficiency there are certain times when there can be other causes like you might have fat malabsorption that can cause low vitamin d or you may have problems with the synthesis because of uh lack of skin oils which when you get exposed to the sun but by and large low vitamin d levels is related to sunshine deficiency and it's it's that you know low vitamin d is not the problem it's a symptom of another problem yeah and the immune system is also benefited by sunshine exposure healthy sunshine uh i think you said you're gonna be you enjoy going to the uh the tropics now and then caribbean hawaii whatever and we we also feel good it's also i this is another thing that i find fascinating is that there is a uh uh a condition which is called sunshine addiction you know these people who are like suntan addicts well it turns out that our bodies actually produce um uh endorphins when we are exposed to the sun so there's a feedback mechanism that's incredible yeah yeah it's it's there's a it's a there's a compound it's called pro-opio melanocorticotropin hormone and what it means is that our bodies give a reward when we're in the sun so we feel good we have these feel-good molecules these endorphins uh that make us want to get the sun oh that's interesting that's why i love going in the sun exactly no and then there are these people who i always feel so good when i go to the beach in the summer it just makes me so happy exactly and and the interesting thing is it actually you can get addicted to the sun and that's like it's like you get addicted to food i mean your body needs food to survive and your body actually needs sunshine to survive so our nature has built in these feedback mechanisms so that it we encourages us to do it that's incredible yeah i don't know why so what happened with this patient uh what did you do for her well i did a lot i mean i had her work with our nutritionist and got her off of her standard american diet i treated her bacterial overgrowth she had a significant sibo test so i treated that primarily with herbs a lot of people will use antibiotics things like rifaximin or xifaxim for sibo i actually find that i do just as well using antimicrobial herb preparations i supported her stomach acid using betaine hcl uh some patients don't respond to that they they don't tolerate as well so sometimes i'll use things like apple cider vinegar and then uh got her fatty acids up gave her a little bit of borage oil and you know a combination of that and then also just told her to get some healthy sunshine uh it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to go out and sunbathe or go to a sun tanning booth but just getting healthy sunshine can help with down regulating the immune system yeah um and interestingly you know just off topic but with covid there are some really interesting studies that giving high-dose vitamin d helps with uh covet infections absolutely and and so covet actually or vitamin d uh when it's at high enough levels actually helps to keep the immune system in balance it keeps it from getting yeah it controls hundreds of genes it regulates immunity and inflammation it's pretty amazing it's not really a vitamin it's more like a hormone exactly exactly it's like a hormone and it's also it actually likes this acts like a steroid too it's it's a it's a cholesterol molecule moiety and uh um i often times when if i'm getting coming down with a cold or flu i'll up my dosage especially in the winter absolutely it's true and i when i feel like something's coming on and i take like fifty thousand units for three or four days and yeah i never i never get sick yeah it goes away by the next morning it is it's pretty powerful so so todd we've just covered a lot here and i i recall a lot of cases of mine that have had rosacea it's always one of those things where i love seeing because it's so easy to treat and people suffer so much from it and just by following the functional medicine approach looking at the root causes treating the skin from the inside out addressing the gut addressing food sensitivities addressing nutritional deficiencies which is really the foundations of functional medicine these people get better and we we don't just take it at face value but we we actually go under the hood and look at what's going on exactly you know i think there was one great quote i heard somewhere that traditional medicine is like uh trying to diagnose uh what's wrong with your car by listening to the noises it makes instead of looking under the hood exactly and functional medicine is about looking under the hood absolutely and here at the ultra wellness center in lenox massachusetts we've been doing this for decades we have the most incredible team here who collectively have probably 70 years of clinical experience in functional medicine and we're doing most of our care virtually now so wherever you live in the world we can take care of it using virtual zoom consults and uh it's pretty gratifying to see how many people are taking advantage of that and getting better uh and and uh i think that uh you know this is a this is a challenging moment for everybody and i think we we often neglect our own health and our own health care uh nobody wants to go to the doctor nobody wants to go to the hospital anymore but but i think you know people can get virtual care now which is super awesome and uh and we invite you to check it out you go to ultrawellnesscenter.com uh if you're suffering from any skin disorder whether it's acne or acne rosacea or eczema or psoriasis we've had some podcasts on that go listen to them but this is really uh an approach that works for skin disorders i love skin problems because they are so easy to treat whether like i said it's eczema acne rosacea whatever it is it's pretty striking and and it's just heartbreaking to see how many patients struggle with these conditions because they're often so embarrassing that's one thing if you have you know bacterial overgrowth and bloating you're the only one who knows your stomach exploded right but if you've got this nasty looking face or skin issues you don't want to be seen like that and i think this is it affects people's uh sense of well-being and their self-worth and absolutely and i just want to know there is really clear approaches that help this yeah and the exciting thing is is is it's a lot of the conferences that i go to there are now functional medicine dermatologists who get it you know because most dermatologists do not realize or remember that the skin and the gut are contiguous they are connected so when you have a skin problem it's oftentimes an internal problem yeah and the functional medicine dermatologists which are um you know growing um are getting that and they're really helpful yeah i agree it is one of the most exciting parts of functional medicine is dermatology because it's like it's like oh it's such a slam dunk yeah and and uh there are a number of really great functional medicine doctors out there who are dermatologists and and you know the stories are amazing i just i just uh you know see so many people suffer on this unnecessary unnecessarily exactly yeah so if you've been loving this podcast and you know someone with a skin problem or you've got a skin problem come see us here share with your friends and family on social media leave a comment we'd love to hear how you've addressed your skin issues what's worked what hasn't worked subscribe wherever you get your podcast and we'll see you next time on the doctor's pharmacy you",

        "transcript": "(upbeat music) So the nose is about rosacea sometimes, unfortunately. So the nose breaks out with pimples, and that's rosacea and that can be pretty much of an issue. So, I think that we're gonna have some things come cranking out towards us in a minute. Look at that. So, what flares rosacea? What flares the nose pimples? Red wine! I can keep my red wine! (laughing) She's a bad patient! I know, I know. The hot, the jalapenos, I can eat these. I just love them. Me too. That's bad for your nose? They make nose acne worse. They make your nose red, they flare your rosacea, they do, so they're a sometimes to know so I'm going to stick them over here. I'm really glad I don't have zits on my nose, because I'm not giving up that, either. This salsa, if it's really spicy. Same deal. (audience saying awww) It's a no. Okay, well, just live with zits on your nose. Coffee and tea, they're a no. My nose, okay, that's pretty much my entire daily diet. My nose should've straight up fallen off my face. And she has a really cute nose. I'm looking right at it. A long time ago! I want you to do Omega-3s, like better in salmon. That's really gonna help you. I don't really like salmon, but I'll trade it for some halibut. And then, Brussels sprouts are really, really good. Sincerely, can we use any seafood? Because I don't love cooked salmon. I like salmon... And so, Omega-3s in salmon or other cooked seafood, yeah. So, I can eat other fish and get my Omega-3s. Exactly. It's not the only fish. Absolutely not. And any cruciferous vegetable or just Brussels sprouts, specifically? Any cruciferous vegetable is fine. They're all good for your skin? They're all good for your skin, yeah. That's if you're prone for your nose.",

        "transcript": "ocular rosacea is a type of rosacea that affects the eyelids and can cause serious implications for the eye so ocularization's inflammation that causes redness burning and itching of the eyes and it often develops in people who have skin rosacea as well which is a chronic skin condition that affects the face sometimes ocular or eye rosacea is the first sign that you may later develop the facial type of rosacea and so in today's video as a dry eye specialist I'm going to guide you through what ocular rosacea is and what can be done about it thank you welcome back to ischool with me Dr D where I teach you about products and treatments related to dry eye syndrome and eye Beauty so that you can have healthy beautiful and comfortable eyes give a little love tap on that subscribe button to stay up to date with all the latest tips and tricks I have for you because I have videos every single week and they're all about dry eye and Beauty so ocularization primarily affects adults between the ages of 30 and 50. it seems to develop in people who tend to blush and flush very easily meaning they get really red cheeks with exercise or even without just like a lot of reddening of the cheeks there's no actual cure for ocularization but medications and a good eye care routine can help control the signs and symptoms the main cause of ocularization well it's really interesting there are so many causes of rosacea there are so many things that impact how your rosacea expresses itself when it gets worse when it gets better and so I think there's really a lot to that but we're gonna go through those causes now the signs and symptoms of ocularization can precede the skin symptoms meaning you can have the eye symptoms first you can have your eye symptoms along with your skin symptoms or you might never have ocular rosacea even if you have skin rosacea but the symptoms of having ocularization can include redness of your eyes burning of your eyes itching watering feeling like your eyes are dry or gritty we call that feeling sometimes foreign body Sensation that means it feels like there's something in your eye all the time you can also have just blurred vision in fact oftentimes early on in ocular rosacea and dry eye syndrome my patients will just have fluctuating and blurred vision like if your vision gets better every single time you blink that's typically a tear film issue and may be due to dry eye you can also have sensitivity to light which we call photophobia photophobia is just um gosh like really sense instead of the light when you weren't before and that can happen as the initial sign of dry eye again a poor tear film can cause some of these symptoms you can also have really dilated small blood vessels on the warp white part of your eye that are visible when you look in the mirror so if you're looking at your conjunctiva or the white part of your eye the sclera and you're seeing more redness than before it can be a sign of ocularization you can also have the same thing on your eyelids if you look really really really close at your eyelids which might be difficult but you can see little red blood vessels cropping up along that lid margin those are called talangic tasias and are pretty indicative of ocular rosacea you also might have ocularization if you have recurrent eye or eyelid infections like having lots of pink eye conjunctivitis all the time you have blepharitis swollen Lids red Lids irritation or even chilesia coming back over and over and over chilesian dyes which I've done like honestly a thousand videos on but everybody searches it so there you go I I don't think they let you link 20 videos but I've done a million videos on styes so the severity of the ocularization symptoms though doesn't always match the severity of the skin symptoms so sometimes my patients will have worse dry eye and ocularization and sort of deny that they even have any skin symptoms at all or vice versa if patients with really bad skin symptoms and no eye symptoms or I also have patients that sort of tend to have both right now let's talk about triggers for ocularization because there's many things that have been pointed at in terms of causes and triggers we don't know the exact cause just like with skin rosacea we really don't know but it can be due to one or more factors it can be due to heredity environmental factors there can be bacterial involvement or you know loss of Skin Barrier issues with the microbiome on the skin block glands in the eyelids eyelid eyelash mites so we're talking about Demodex mites again I did a whole video on those but they have been pointed as being part of the root cause of rosacea at times there's some research that has shown a possible link between skin rosacea and helicobacter pylori bacteria which is the same bacteria that causes gastrointestinal infections and has been looked at in terms of causing ulcers as well there's certainly something to the whole gut skin brain axis you know they talk about sort of that microbiome connection so that's been pointed as well as a potential cause of rosacea there's a number of factors that can aggravate or trigger skin rosacea and they can aggravate or trigger ocular rosacea as well so we're talking about things like eating hot foods spicy foods and beverages alcohol Dairy sunlight wind or temperature extremes even emotions like stress anger or embarrassment strenuous exercise hot baths or saunas a patient who has a um sauna I just said it yeah like a dry sauna at his house and I can tell when I'm doing his IPL and he's been in that sauna because of sort of like rosaceous worsened we see more challenges more blood vessels popping up so there's other risk factors as well ocular rosacea is common in people with skin rosacea obviously that makes sense although you can have it without the skin being involved and skin rosacea affects more women than men although it affects both and ocularization affects men and women equally I don't know if that's so true I think it's also fair to say like you know my next sentence is well it's also more common in fair-skinned people and I think you know we would probably most of us would agree we see rosacea Moore and fair-skinned people but I think unfortunately sometimes when you get up into the fits types four five and six because of skin tone maybe it's not as easy to recognize certainly you're going to recognize those vascular changes um even those acneic changes the redness you're going to see it on really fair skin you're not going to see it as easily on darker skin types and so it may be underrepresented in the fits types four five and six so in terms of complications and what does it actually do so ocular rosacea can affect the surface of your eye especially your cornea your tear film particularly if you end up having dry eyes from the evaporation of the tears so rosacea tends to affect sebaceous glands meibomian glands are derived from sebaceous glands and they secrete oil my patients with ocular rosacea have poor oil within their meibomian glands and then they have all these talingic tasias on their lid margin it's a chronic progressive thing dry eye is so and 86 percent of dry eye has been shown to have and on meibomian gland dysfunction component we know that having poor oil gives you poor tears we know that having poor tears and not having the oil to coat and protect your tears leads to chronic inflammation of the entire ocular surface we also know from toyos's work that Celine dictages on your eyelids on your face even are associated with an increased level of interleukin 17 and 6 on the ocular surface and that's the whole pathophysiology of why IPL works because IPL reduces talangectages on your eyelids on your face itself and because you're reducing those you're reducing inflammation on the ocular surface and so ovular rosacea it's a very convoluted like process but basically it's an issue with these glands you don't have good oil glands if you don't have good oil glands you don't have good tears in general that can lead to an evaporation of the aqueous component of your tears it then leads to changes into your Chemistry right so now we have tears that have a different osmolarity than they should different concentration of all kinds of different things proteins there's inflammation present so again it's like this whole inflammatory Cascade that then can result in issues with your tear film which oh by the way your tear film's job is to make your vision clear and be the first refractive surface and protect your cornea and so now your cornea which is really really full of nerve fibers is sustaining damage as well epithelial damage the epithelium is that top layer of the cornea and so that cornea become irritated now there's other things that happen too with long-term ocularization I have a patient in his 80s that has had ocularization his whole life obviously treatments were really not there for most of his life and so at this point he has a lot of what's called trachiasis so lashes that grow the wrong way now what does that have to do with your oil glands well if you have poor oil glands and inflammation within the eyelid over time and I'm not taking this from a study this is just something I've noticed clinically the lashes change right so the Lash follicle seems to be affected too by chronic low-grade inflammation of the eyelid margin dropping out of meibomian glands glands that don't move at all that are dying out now the Lash follicle which is adjacent is changing as well we can get misdirected lashes we can get lashes that are falling out and misdirected lashes can poke your cornea I'll show you a picture of one here it's painful your cornea is full of all of these nerve endings it's potentially already degraded from a poor tear film from ocularization and now on top of it you got lashes growing the wrong way and it's poking your cornea so anyway that's kind of what happens to the ocular surface and why it's so so important to intervene and try and get better oil secretion but we'll get to that so let's get back to like what can you do the best diet for ocular rosacea is really the best diet for rosacea in general avoiding spicy foods hot beverages alcohol things like that there are many many reported dietary triggers and so you really have to individualize that I would say you'd almost have to take a diary of when your rosacea is worse and try to figure out what your triggers are so that you can identify those in a directed fashion rather than just never eating the things you love just because I said that they might be a trigger now there are some foods that can improve rosacea so fresh fruits an important aspect of treating rosacea with food is to try to remember to pick foods that have anti-inflammatory properties this is an inflammatory disease so fresh organic fruits not only have anti-inflammatory properties but also contain a high amount of antioxidants so you know things we love like blueberries pomegranate all of these are great to help prevent damage on a cellular level another type of food is fatty fish so I'll link to the Ziggler's fish oil product here fatty fish also contain anti-inflammatory properties because they have high levels of zinc and omega-3 fatty acids both zinc and omega-3 fatty acids help to inhibit pro-inflammatory Pathways and help block inflammation omega-3 fatty acids can also help to prevent dry eye symptoms in people with ocularization so this is a huge go-to one great source of omega-3 fatty acids are flax seeds and walnuts in your diet but it's often difficult to get enough and so again linking Ziggler's product supplementing with a high quality pharmaceutical grade fish oil is a great idea I love PRN Pharmaceuticals I love Nordic Naturals and I love the hydrate brand omega-3 as well turmeric is a spice it's derived from a plant out of India curcumalanga I don't know how to say these things but basically the plant's known for its anti-inflammatory properties one theory is that an active compound within turmeric called curcumin contributes to its anti-inflammatory capabilities you will see turmeric pop up in dry eye supplements there's a number of supplements that contain it next we have fermented foods so it was found that bacterial overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract May worsen rosacea and that patients with rosacea are more prone to gastrointestinal infections that's that gut skin brain health connection right I'm an eye doctor that's not really my area but there's something to that there was a study that found that when gastrointestinal imbalances were treated with probiotics the severity of the participants rosacea was reduced in addition to probiotic supplements fermented foods are full of probiotics that may be beneficial to keep gut bacteria in Balance to help prevent the infections and the rosacea flare-ups so examples of delicious and nutritious fermented foods would include like miso kefir kombucha love kombucha would also recommend high fiber vegetables so Bland vegetables can also help to improve rosacea by helping to prevent bacterial overgrowth vegetables like leafy greens asparagus and legumes like lentils can help to create an environment that allows for good gut bacteria to grow and diversify you also want to avoid starches and refined sugars which will help to prevent gut bacterial overgrowth so how do you get diagnosed with this well there's no specific tests or procedures to diagnose ocularization per se usually eye doctors are making a diagnosis based upon your symptoms your medical history and then just kind of looking at your eyes and eyelids and the skin of your face I would say for me as a dry specialist a dead giveaway is the quality of the um my bum and then the talangectages on the lid margin point me in that Direction ocular rosacea can usually be controlled with medication and home care but it doesn't cure the condition and so it tends to be very chronic your doctor might prescribe things like oral antibiotic we'll use things like tetracycline doxycycline erythromycin and Minocycline these are antibiotics used in low doses it is not for the antibiotic effect it's actually for the secondary effect of thinning out the oils and so many patients with ocularization will find themselves especially on doxycycline and doxycycline over time can help the oil glands in my opinion you also need the oil glands to be unblocked and expressed but I digress for a severe disease you might take an antibiotic for a longer time so I've had patients before that took doxycycline for months if not years of course working on your diet is really important healthy foods healthy fats probiotic rich foods identifying and tracking the foods and drinks that you consume assume that seem to trigger or soothe your symptoms can be a really good move as well so in terms of ocularization Doxycycline is not it I think it's really important to control what's going on on your face it's really important to have an eye wash and a face wash that control your bacterial populations in your Demodex population so I'll link the Ziggler's tea tree oil washes and eyelid scrubs I think that's critically important doxy can be very helpful low-dose Naltrexone can be helpful as well Dr toyos makes a video about it I plan to make a video about it in the next few months and more than anything IPL and light based therapies along with expression of your meibomian glands when patients have ocularization they don't make good oil they make sort of thicker oil they have all these blood vessels nothing works like IPL works I intense pulse light was founded or found by Dr toyos when he was treating rosacea patients finding that they're dry I got better at least that's what I've always heard that is the mechanism the mechanism is that it's attracted to pigment it's attracted to blood vessels it takes care of blood vessels it gets them gone thereby reducing inflammation at the ocular surface it also helps control bacterial levels it also helps kill Demodex mites IPL works so well for ocular rosacea we also have the other light based therapies like low-level light therapy and then expressing the glands if you have oil that's been backed up for 30 years if you have oil glands that are going away literally shortening appear to be empty don't appear appear to be there anymore you've got to do something to wake them back up if they're not already gone so you know things like gland probing and expressing the glands is critically important so that's it about ocularization I've also made another video about ocularization I've also made tons and tons and tons of videos so you can go down the rabbit hole please do on my bromine gland dysfunction and Demodex and all of it it's a good time so I hope I answered all your questions about ocularization treatment triggers diet and causes and even though it can't be cured it can be managed most often very successfully so make sure to find yourself a dry specialist you know like and trust and leave me comments below if I can fill in anything else about ocularization thanks so much for watching Today class is dismissed and I'll see you next time foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry and in this video I want to talk with you about nine skin conditions that get dramatically better with a ketogenic diet have you ever went to the doctor with a skin condition and only to be told well we're not really sure what causes it here use this cream or take this pill it might help a little bit you're just gonna have to live with it it might get better but basically the take-home message is I don't know what caused it this might help you're probably going to have to live with it well in this video you're going to learn about nine different skin conditions that most doctors consider to be chronic and progressive that can actually get drastically better when you lower your carbohydrate intake lower your intake of inflammatory foods and eat a ketogenic diet now if you haven't already done so please consider clicking that subscribe button and the little bell right beside the subscribe button so that every time I have a bright idea that might improve your health you'll get a notification from YouTube never in my 20 years have I seen a way of eating that was so therapeutically powerful at reversing chronic disease all over the human body but definitely in the skin I've seen this with my own eyes in my 20 years of clinical practice back when I was recommending the - diet that 88 diets the Weight Watchers diet the Jenny Craig diet I never saw people's skin conditions get better it just didn't happen when I started recommending a low-carb ketogenic diet all of a sudden people would come back and say this happened is that normal this is better is that normal I didn't refill my medication for the skin condition anymore since I've been eating this way and the first few times I heard that I wasn't really impressed because you know things happen but after I heard about hundred examples of that I thought maybe there's something to this I've heard it now from scores of health care providers both in person and online first of all asking me how how do I teach my patients to eat a low-carb ketogenic diet and then a few months later them messaging me and saying I just this chronic skin condition get completely bent better in a patient is that something that Kido does I've also heard from thousands of people both in person and online with stories of how the chronic skin condition that they really had no hope would ever get better got better on a ketogenic diet now first I want to tell you how I think this actually happens and then we're going to talk about the nine conditions that I have seen with my own eyes get better with keto or have heard from literally thousands of people that keto makes it better now what's the mechanism behind this how does that work right I mean use keto magic no I don't think so but I think that keto is very physiologically powerful on the metabolism of the human body here's how when you're eating the standard American diet or one of those other diets I've mentioned you're having chronic blood sugar spikes all through the day that causes problems with your skin your you have chronic hyperinsulinemia from eating all the carbohydrates and that absolutely leads to skin conditions both the inflammation the immune system and the high blood sugar problems there are inflammatory ingredients even in health food and if you don't know what they are then you're going to suffer from chronic skin conditions the ketogenic diet if properly done removes all those inflammatory components from your diet there you have chronic bad innapropriate inflammation and so many of these skin conditions that's what's going on and then you have the final but probably the most important thing for some of these skin conditions if you have autoimmune confusion your immune system is confused about where the boundary is between you and not you and so your immune system starts to mistakenly attack cells that are part of you a lot of doctors will we'll talk about this that your immune system is too strong and we need to weaken it that's absolutely not true at all you want a very strong immune system but you also want it to be calm and wise so that it knows where the boundary between yourselves and foreign cells but your antigens and foreign antigens and every skin condition I'm about to talk about is caused by in some combinations these six variables that's what's causing every single one of these and when you're eating that properly formulated real whole food single ingredient ketogenic diet you get rid of all those causes for these chronic skin conditions allowing your body a chance to heal with your skin now let's talk about the actual conditions number one is acne and this applies for for people who children who are nine ten eleven years old with acne this applies with forty and fifty year old men and women with acne your acne is going to get better when you follow the tenets of a well formed ketogenic diet number two skin tags I actually have a video on this channel about skin tags going away with keto it's absolutely true I've heard thousands of stories I've seen it multiple times with my own eyes skin tags are a sign of metabolic syndrome or chronic hyperinsulinemia and when you lower the carbs and you lower the insulin the skin tax either get smaller or completely fall off and go away next is psoriasis psoriasis is if I mean many experts in the field say this is chronic and progressive it's genetic it's autoimmune there's nothing you can do about it except to take these expensive medications that have possible terrible side effects I've seen I've seen psoriasis reversed and be 90 95 percent better four years after someone started a very low carb ketogenic diet I did weight a good rule of thumb that you can think about this is go back and look on the Internet at photographs of people from the late 1800s and the very early nineteen hundred's that's way before we had a lot of the inflammatory ingredients in our modern food supply and it's way before people were eating way too many carbs you won't see any of these skin conditions in those pictures or if you do it's one person out of a million that's the way it should be if we're eating the proper human diet number four is vitiligo you may have heard recently Joe Rogan went carnivore which is this close to zero carb as you can get he did that for a month and after one month he could tell that his vitiligo was getting better he was actually starting to fill in pigment in the deep pigmented areas huge that's a huge deal for somebody with vitiligo because if it's severe enough it can cause severe social consequences number five vasculitis there's there's many different forms of vasculitis but it's all caused by chronic inflammation and autoimmune confusion when you remove those things from your body by removing the crap from your diet all the vasculitis is just get better they may not go 100% away but they're gonna be so much better you won't have to worry about taking immune killing prednisone or other medications next is eczema eczema even in the tiniest baby who's on rice and corn formula so a formula those things are very inflammatory in your baby's little cheeks will show you immediately just how inflammatory they are their skin may get very inflamed with eczema the pediatrician says I don't know you must be genetic out here to put this cream on there get the inflammatory foods out of your baby's mouth and the eczema will just go away this applies to teenagers and adults as well if you have chronic eczema something in your body is causing one of the six things I mentioned earlier and that's leading to your eczema remove the poison from your diet it's a slow poison no doubt it's not going to kill you today or tomorrow but it is keeping your skin inflamed keeping your insulin high and keeping your immune system confused next is rosacea I personally have the tendency to have rosacea and back when I was a younger doctor and I was eating just a standard American crap and even when I was eating a paleo diet I had to use a strong a cortisone pointment a strong steroid two or three times a week on my rosacea to keep it from being obvious now I haven't put a steroid in my face and in years but eating a low-carb real Whole Foods single ingredient ketogenic diet it's just like I don't have it and I've seen this in scores of other patients over my patients personally and then I've heard all the stories online number 8 is hair loss early male pattern baldness and female pattern baldness are both exquisitely linked with metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome comes from all the six things that I just talked about earlier and so if you know somebody who's starting to lose their hair in their 20s that is the first sign that they are developing metabolic syndrome some people express it by getting fat some people express it by getting diabetes some people express it by losing their hair hair loss absolutely is gonna slow down when you eat a well-formulated ketogenic diet then number nine and this is gonna really piss off some dermatologists is skin cancer skin cancer is not caused by the Sun skin cancer is not prevented by anything that you slather on your skin at all skin cancer is caused by building weakened skin cells by eating a crap diet and then with the chronic inflammation and the chronic immune confusion when we all have cancer cells that develop in our skin probably every day but our immune system if it's calm and intelligent is able to root out the cancer cell and nothing comes of it you never know but if your immune system is chronically confused and your system is your skin is chronically inflamed you're gonna get skin cancer much more commonly now if you've reversed one of these skin conditions with the ketogenic diet with the low-carb diet the Banting diet the Atkins diet or the carnivore diet please tell your story in the comments because there are so many new people coming to this way of eating and they just can't believe it it sounds like magic like this can't be right my doctor said it we don't know what caused it and there's no cure and I'm stuck with it but now this guy's telling me I can actually make it 95 if not a hundred percent better by eating certain foods and avoiding other foods please put your story in the comments so that these newcomers can see basically their story but with a happy ending that's gonna that's gonna be the thing that helps them go okay I'm gonna give this a try for a month now if you know someone's suffering from any of these conditions and they don't get know about keto please consider sharing this video with him you can send a link in an email in a text message on your whatsapp you can share it on your Facebook wherever but please help

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

useful and\u00a0\nalso the skincare routine very effective i'm so\u00a0\u00a0 glad to hear that and that is the whole purpose of\u00a0\nthat video i have experienced rosacea first hand\u00a0\u00a0 and i know exactly how it feels to experience\u00a0\nrosacea on today's video as you can tell by the\u00a0\u00a0 title i'm going to talk about the foods to avoid\u00a0\nas well as the foods to eat for rosacea i hope you\u00a0\u00a0 find this video useful and if this is your first\u00a0\ntime here on my channel welcome my name is sarita\u00a0\u00a0 i mostly do like fashion videos skincare lifestyle\u00a0\nvlogs and i also talk about money if that is the\u00a0\u00a0 sort of content you like then please don't forget\u00a0\nto subscribe my channel i love to have you here\u00a0\u00a0 before i start this video i want to give you like\u00a0\na little bit of a history about my skin basically\u00a0\u00a0 i started suffering from rosacea in my 20s it\u00a0\nwas actually redness fast then it got worse and\u00a0\u00a0 it turned out to be acne rosacea apart from my\u00a0\nforehead my entire face was full of acne redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flakiness at one point i really struggled to\u00a0\nopen my mouth because i had like acne as well as\u00a0\u00a0 dryness all over my mouth especially on the corner\u00a0\nso when i would try to eat something it would hurt\u00a0\u00a0 a lot that is how worst my skin was at the moment\u00a0\nthis is the best my skin has been i'm wearing a\u00a0\u00a0 little bit of makeup but if you are interested to\u00a0\nwatch how i cleared my skin then i'll put a video\u00a0\u00a0 link up here as well as on my description box\u00a0\nso that you guys can go and watch that later it\u00a0\u00a0 has been a long journey to get where i am today\u00a0\nwith my skin but i'm really happy at the moment\u00a0\u00a0 and also i cleared my skin without any medication\u00a0\nbefore i used to rely a lot on medication which\u00a0\u00a0 was prescribed by doctors and dermatologists\u00a0\nhowever at the end i managed to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 without medication by myself which i'm really\u00a0\nproud of so let's talk about the relationship\u00a0\u00a0 of food with rosacea rosacea as we all know is\u00a0\nnot curable however it can be managed by diet as\u00a0\u00a0 well there are many foods that can trigger rosacea\u00a0\nparticularly the food that contains high level of\u00a0\u00a0 acid spice and sugary stuff i went to see quite\u00a0\na lot of dermatologists but they were heavily\u00a0\u00a0 focused on medication rather than on the diet\u00a0\ni was given all sorts of ointment to put on my\u00a0\u00a0 face i was only once recommended antibiotics\u00a0\nwhich i had for nearly two months only like\u00a0\u00a0 one dermatologist told me i should be avoiding\u00a0\nspicy food and sugary stuff hence the reason i\u00a0\u00a0 never really focused much on diet at first when it\u00a0\nstarted i was eating everything later through my\u00a0\u00a0 research i found out there is a direct correlation\u00a0\nbetween food and rosacea also not just by research\u00a0\u00a0 actually i found it myself there were\u00a0\ncertain foods that would trigger my rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 straight away like red one as soon as i had\u00a0\nred wine or even white wine would flush my skin\u00a0\u00a0 and make it red i'm not a drinker i only socially\u00a0\ndrink everybody used to ask me like are you all\u00a0\u00a0 right like what's going on with your face because\u00a0\nas soon as i had drank wine you could see the\u00a0\u00a0 effects of wine straightaways hence people were\u00a0\nlike really concerned about it which i don't\u00a0\u00a0 blame them because a lot of people have\u00a0\nno knowledge about rosacea i didn't have\u00a0\u00a0 knowledge about rosacea before i actually suffered\u00a0\nmyself the food triggers for rosacea varies from\u00a0\u00a0 person to person i'm going to talk about firstly\u00a0\nabout the list of food that you should be avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 and then next what i'll do is i'll talk about\u00a0\nthe food that really helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 so the first one is high acid vegetables yes\u00a0\nwe all think veg is good for us however when\u00a0\u00a0 it comes to rosacea there are certain foods you\u00a0\nshould be avoiding like tomatoes hot peppers onion\u00a0\u00a0 radish this is spinach but i didn't avoid spinach\u00a0\nactually i feel like spinach works well for my\u00a0\u00a0 skin it comes down my skin you have to do quite a\u00a0\nlot of trial test out all the food basically when\u00a0\u00a0 it comes to drink alcohol like gene wine even bear\u00a0\nhot coffee another one is the food that release\u00a0\u00a0 histamine when i say histamine it is citrus foods\u00a0\nlike oranges lemon etc however again i've actually\u00a0\u00a0 not avoided them it works really well for my skin\u00a0\nnext one is dairy products like milk cheese yogurt\u00a0\u00a0 i cut dairy out of my diet and i'll tell you\u00a0\nlater what happened another one is the last one\u00a0\u00a0 high level of refined or concentrated sugar and\u00a0\nsodium like processed food to sum up basically we\u00a0\u00a0 should be avoiding food that actually heat up our\u00a0\nbody spike blood sugar levels that will contribute\u00a0\u00a0 towards facial redness and triggers rosacea so\u00a0\nnow let's talk about what sorts of foods i avoided\u00a0\u00a0 basically i did quite a lot of trial i went to see\u00a0\nactually chinese like herbal medicine practitioner\u00a0\u00a0 which you can find in all the local town they have\u00a0\nlike this little store i went to see them they\u00a0\u00a0 took like a strand of my hair cut this off and\u00a0\nsent it to lab for test they wanted to check my\u00a0\u00a0 food allergy i have no food allergy at all after a\u00a0\ncouple of days my result came back and i was given\u00a0\u00a0 this sheet where there was like a tick mark of\u00a0\nfoods this is gonna sound so crazy but most of\u00a0\u00a0 the stuff i should be avoiding like garlic ginger\u00a0\nonion peppers chocolates fizzy drinks there were a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of foods that came back saying i should be\u00a0\navoiding which i can't remember off top of my\u00a0\u00a0 head at the moment but that is some of the food\u00a0\nthat i was told to avoid i was in shock after\u00a0\u00a0 that results came if i had gone by that sheet then\u00a0\nobviously i would have to have plain bland food\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually did avoid fizzy drinks and this\u00a0\nstuff they have listed like garlic ginger but\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't see much difference i did it for about\u00a0\na month and i didn't see any difference so at the\u00a0\u00a0 end i started eating garlic onion fizzy drinks\u00a0\nand then also like chocolates then what i decided\u00a0\u00a0 to do was i decided to write a food diary which\u00a0\nhelped me a lot i highly recommend you guys to\u00a0\u00a0 do a food diary which will help you to understand\u00a0\nwhich food is triggering rosacea so i wrote a food\u00a0\u00a0 diary and i was writing each day what i ate and\u00a0\nwhen i had flare up basically i understood from\u00a0\u00a0 my diary spicy food hot foods were triggering my\u00a0\nrosacea as well as drink wise i found out coffee\u00a0\u00a0 was triggering my rosacea at that point i\u00a0\nused to drink like four to five cups of coffee\u00a0\u00a0 in a day other one was wine particularly red wine\u00a0\ni always started avoiding spicy food which helped\u00a0\u00a0 me a lot i saw a massive difference in my skin\u00a0\nactually when i started to avoid spicy food and\u00a0\u00a0 being an asian it is so hard to avoid spicy food\u00a0\nbecause we grew up eating spicy food even today\u00a0\u00a0 i only occasionally eat spicy food after eating\u00a0\nspicy food what used to happen was i could feel\u00a0\u00a0 my body heat up and then the skin flushing would\u00a0\nhappen like i would have redness all over my face\u00a0\u00a0 apart from my forehead so straight away i could\u00a0\nfeel it was affecting me hence i stopped spicy\u00a0\u00a0 food i also did avoid dairy i thought it\u00a0\nwould calm down my acne as well as redness\u00a0\u00a0 maybe it's the dairy that's affecting my rosacea\u00a0\nafter a while i realized it was not the dairy\u00a0\u00a0 actually when i was eating yogurt it was helping\u00a0\nmy skin to calm down and yogurts we all know it\u00a0\u00a0 has like good bacteria it is probiotic which is\u00a0\nlike good for gut health at this point i want to\u00a0\u00a0 mention about the gut health as well if you have a\u00a0\ngood good as well that helps you to calm your skin\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea i don't drink milk or have a cheese\u00a0\ni only have cheese with pizza i do have yogurt\u00a0\u00a0 just for my good health i realized dairy wasn't\u00a0\naffecting my skin also you guys know like i put\u00a0\u00a0 yogurt on my skin with green tea which actually\u00a0\nreally helped to calm my skin and yogurt has\u00a0\u00a0 got lactic acid which removes all the dead skin\u00a0\ncells from the top layer i talked in depth about\u00a0\u00a0 this homemade marks on my recent videos i'll\u00a0\nleave the link here as well as i'll leave the\u00a0\u00a0 link down below as usual next one i did a trial\u00a0\nwas sugary food so especially i was mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate so i just gave up chocolates\u00a0\ndidn't see much difference to be honest\u00a0\u00a0 until this day i eat chocolates occasionally\u00a0\nespecially i prefer dark chocolates because it\u00a0\u00a0 is apparently good for your skin when it comes to\u00a0\nhot drinks i strictly avoided coffee i only have\u00a0\u00a0 coffee once in the morning that's it instead of\u00a0\nhaving a lot of coffee i actually started drinking\u00a0\u00a0 green tea with mint which i again talked about\u00a0\non my last video so i would not touch on that\u00a0\u00a0 and that had to come my skin a lot the last one\u00a0\nwas spinach spinach actually didn't affect my\u00a0\u00a0 skin a lot i was actually drinking a spinach juice\u00a0\nas well as spinach salad i actually didn't avoid\u00a0\u00a0 spinach i have still included that in my diet\u00a0\nbasically i did a lot of trial with food and\u00a0\u00a0 wrote a food diary which helped me to understand\u00a0\nwhich food was actually affecting me so strictly i\u00a0\u00a0 avoided spicy food reduce the intake of coffee and\u00a0\nwine i drink wine now but only very occasionally\u00a0\u00a0 now i'm gonna move on to what foods to eat to calm\u00a0\nyour rosacea you should be eating like 25 to 35\u00a0\u00a0 fresh veg another 25 to 35 protein and then rest\u00a0\nis grains when it comes to veg eat high water\u00a0\u00a0 content veg avoid high acid veg protein you can\u00a0\neat like chicken and all the food that has protein\u00a0\u00a0 in it and when it comes to grains you can have\u00a0\nlentils rice i try to stick to this person taste\u00a0\u00a0 also try food with antioxidants which is good\u00a0\nfor your skin overall as well as it is great for\u00a0\u00a0 anti-aging so when it comes to rosacea like there\u00a0\nare a lot of anti-aging stuff we can't put on our\u00a0\u00a0 face because it triggers our rosacea i personally\u00a0\ndon't use any anti-aging creams because i focus\u00a0\u00a0 more on calming my skin down and hydration that's\u00a0\nthe reason why i don't use anti-aging products\u00a0\u00a0 if you don't use anti-aging products like i\u00a0\ndo then definitely include antioxidants like\u00a0\u00a0 blueberries strawberries blackberries etc in your\u00a0\nfood also another thing i would say to include is\u00a0\u00a0 probiotics which i mentioned earlier and fermented\u00a0\nfood which is really good for good i eat lots of\u00a0\u00a0 probiotics and fermented food like kimchi and\u00a0\nfermented like spinach which we call gunruk which\u00a0\u00a0 is very traditional food from nepal i'm originally\u00a0\nfrom nepal if you guys don't know and i eat a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of yogurts and i also put a lot of yogurt on my\u00a0\nface at least twice a week also i forgot to touch\u00a0\u00a0 on veg like what type of high content water veg\u00a0\nyou should have like cucumber asparagus broccoli\u00a0\u00a0 celery lettuce pumpkin so you can have all those\u00a0\nhigh water content food also salmon is great for\u00a0\u00a0 someone who suffers from rosacea definitely\u00a0\nincludes salmon i absolutely love salmon i'm\u00a0\u00a0 a big fan of salmon actually it has got omega-3\u00a0\nwhich is anti-inflammatory decreases redness so\u00a0\u00a0 that is the foods you need to add in your diet\u00a0\ntry not to have too much junk food i do eat junk\u00a0\u00a0 food i have not avoided or have a total ban on\u00a0\njunk food i do like to treat myself sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 with those sort of food as well but overall i try\u00a0\nto eat more veg protein and then grains let's sum\u00a0\u00a0 this video up actually because i've given you\u00a0\nso much information and i don't want you to be\u00a0\u00a0 confused i strictly avoided spicy food but reduce\u00a0\nthe intake of coffee and replaced it with green\u00a0\u00a0 tea and mint i try to eat like high water content\u00a0\nveg probiotics and fermented food to maintain my\u00a0\u00a0 gut health i feel like when my gut is not great i\u00a0\ncan see that on my skin as well avoiding couple of\u00a0\u00a0 foods actually really helped me to clear my skin i\u00a0\nwould highly recommend you guys to do a food diary\u00a0\u00a0 do a trial of different food i mentioned and see\u00a0\nwhich one triggers you and which one doesn't and\u00a0\u00a0 you can decide which one to include and which one\u00a0\nnot to include in your diet i hope this video was\u00a0\u00a0 useful for you please do like comment and\u00a0\nsubscribe my channel if there is any video\u00a0\u00a0 request then please do let me know and i'll\u00a0\nsee you guys very soon till then take care bye",

        "transcript": "well hey guys in this video we're going to be talking about things in your diet that may be causing your face to turn red these are different categories of foods we're going to cover seven of them that could be leading to flushing redness if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i'm a board certified dermatologist i upload skincare content here on youtube pretty regularly definitely subscribe hit the bell notification that tells you when my videos go live facial redness is something a lot of people cope with it can be really embarrassing and specifically many people deal with a condition called rosacea this is a chronic skin condition that is accompanied by sensitive skin and bouts of flushing as well as sometimes little red bumps even little pus bumps why people get rosacea as dictated by probably their genetics as well as a variety of environmental triggers including diet the role of diet as a potential trigger for facial redness is widely accepted many patients report that certain categories of foods trigger redness and that when they avoid those foods the redness improves especially those with rosacea who are typically encouraged to keep a diary of triggers for their symptoms now i want to emphasize before getting into the categories of foods that what is a trigger for one person is not necessarily a trigger for another person so this video is in no way shape or form telling you that you should cut out all of these foods you're merely pointing out foods categories of foods and beverage there are potential mechanisms behind triggering facial redness and if it sounds like it's something that is a trigger for you then you know consider looking more into it but don't just go eliminating stuff out of your diet the number one dietary trigger for facial redness is alcohol alcoholic beverages especially wine red wine more so than white wine as well as spirits there's a large study that was conducted for over 14 years in patients with rosacea and alcohol had a very strong link with rosacea severity why might alcohol trigger facial redness histamine gets released as a breakdown of different byproducts of alcohol metabolism like acetaldehyde and acetone and histamine is a compound that leads to blood vessel dilation it also leads to inflammation and that can trigger facial redness alcohol is not only a trigger for rosacea but other issues related to facial redness like urticaria otherwise known as hives alcohol frequently triggers and worsens different types of chronic itch as well aside from histamine another possible mechanism by which alcohol leads to facial redness is actually through opioid-like effects in the skin this was demonstrated in a study where people who were flushed with alcohol consumption were given a compound called naltrexone which blocks the opioid receptors and you have opioid receptors in your skin when they then consumed alcohol after taking this opioid blocker they didn't have any flushing there are these little proteins throughout your skin that you've got to know about if you care at all about skin and those are called transient receptor potential ion channels or trip channels these channels regulate the skin barrier they dictate cell proliferation and differentiation and they also play a key role in how the immune system goes about doing its thing in the skin certain compounds bind to these transient receptor potential or trip channels and lead to blood vessel dilation the trip channel trpv1 it sits on the little nerves that course through our skin as well as on the skin cells called keratinocytes and this ion channel is activated by alcohol the downstream effect of that is inflammation coming to the skin vasodilation and sensory symptoms of burning stinging and discomfort this inflammatory cascade also leads to increases in trans epidermal water loss that's why a lot of people who deal with facial redness also have associated dryness of the skin likely mediated by activation of these trpv1 channels and alcohol is a known activator as are a variety of other dietary triggers that we're going to get into in a moment so alcohol is a big one and you can see there are a variety of mechanisms whether you have rosacea or not it certainly can trigger facial redness many people of asian descent are slow metabolizers of alcohol they have buildup of that acetaldehyde metabolite and they develop flushing that is quite intense with very limited alcohol consumption they metabolize it less well and it can definitely lead to facial redness dietary factor number two that can trigger facial redness is capsaicin what the heck is that capsaicin is something in spicy food like peppers that binds to these trp channels and leads to symptoms of burning and pain if you've ever eaten a spicy pepper and you have a burning mouth it is because of the trip channels when i say spicy i'm talking about like chili peppers hot sauce cayenne jalapeno capsaicin is a colorless oil and it binds to these trp channels but it's got this unique long hydrocarbon tail that allows it to really bind quite tenaciously to these channels and kind of glom on there and really activate them that is why you get a burning mouth with like certain chili peppers and it's related to the relative amount of capsaicin in the pepper it's most abundant actually in the membranes around the seeds in chili peppers so if you ever chop up chili peppers and you don't want the dish to be as spicy you've probably been told to remove the seeds that's why the capsaicin is most abundant in that outer membranous part of the seed while capsaicin is most abundant in your chili peppers it can also be found in low amounts in certain spices like oregano cilantro and cinnamon if you're into spicy food perhaps you've heard of something called the scoville heat scale a pharmacist by the name of wilbur scoville came up with this ranks different chili peppers based on their capsaicin content kind of as a guide to how spicy it's going to be capsaicin binds very tenaciously to those trip channels you get that burning sensation and you also get vasodilation of the blood vessels in the skin leading to facial redness most people don't just go around snacking on chili peppers maybe you do i don't but some cuisines actually end up layering a few different ingredients each with quite a bit of capsaicin so for example you can imagine that if you have um a chili or curry that's made with chili peppers and then you go adding in certain spices that have a moderate amount of capsaicin you end up getting quite a mega dose of capsaicin and this is reflected in how avoidant many people with rosacea are of certain types of cuisine in a survey of patients with rosacea 49 of them avoided mexican food they can't tolerate it because it just exacerbates their facial redness 30 33 avoided indian food that sounds miserable indian food is one of my favorites and 27 percent had to avoid thai food another one of my favorites these types of cuisine frequently incorporate high capsaicin foods like many chili peppers and so i guess that makes sense but yeah doesn't sound like much fun to me dietary factor number three is cinnamaldehyde this is a compound that is most abundant and like cinnamon as the name would imply but it's also in a variety of other foods tomatoes citrus fruits and chocolate cinnamaldehyde binds to those trip channels leading to dilation of the blood vessels and facial redness for people with rosacea this also can elicit their symptoms burning and stinging and it can aggravate the appearance of something called telangectacious persistently little dilated blood vessels like most obvious on the nose and the cheeks so people who are sensitive to cinnamaldehyde they have to avoid like chocolate citrus fruits tomato based dishes and cooking the tomato doesn't get rid of the cinnamaldehyde in that study that surveyed people with rosacea about their dietary patterns and triggers 25 of them actually had to avoid italian food and the other thing you know i mentioned cinnamon but cinnamon also has a moderate amount of capsaicin so you have those little trip channels to blame and you can imagine how different dishes that combine a few of these ingredients like maybe a chocolate covered orange would be even more problematic or a more likely trigger for somebody who is sensitive to these compounds in foods dietary factor number four is going to be hot liquids 33 of people with rosacea find that they have to avoid hot coffee and 30 percent find they have to avoid tea probably related to the temperature when you have heat from hot liquids that's going to cause the blood vessels in the skin to dilate that can lead to flushing and redness heat also triggers the sympathetic nervous system one thing that's been investigated with regards to the coffee association is there's been this question is it related to caffeine interestingly enough one study showed that caffeinated coffee had an inverse relationship with rosacea meaning the more coffee caffeinated coffee you consumed the less likely you were to have rosacea and this wasn't true for other caffeinated foods or beverages like caffeinated soda caffeinated tea or chocolate and that again may be related to other compounds in those foods but it's interesting and it's thought maybe it has to do with the fact that caffeine has a vasoconstrictive effect helping to reduce redness i really think a big driving force when it comes to these beverages though is drinking them hot for people with redness as a major trigger because there was a study that showed that if you gave people coffee or you gave them water at 22 degrees celsius neither the coffee nor the water at 22 degrees celsius triggered redness in the face however when you heated that liquid up to 60 degrees celsius both the coffee as well as the water triggered facial redness so a lot of it likely has to do with the temperature but some of these other liquids they do have other compounds in them that could in fact trigger rosacea or redness things like cinnamaldehyde if you're having say a latte with cinnamon on top now you've got the heat and you've got the cinnamon if you're having hot chocolate with cinnamon on it you can see how the heat plus the cinnamon plus the chocolate may be an aggravating factor for you so for some people maybe they tolerate iced coffee just fine they don't have that temperature effect you know maybe the caffeine ends up helping them out and they have no issue with it dietary factor number five are foods that release histamine i mentioned this in the beginning when i was explaining how alcohol triggers redness but histamine is a compound that gets released by cells in the immune system called mast cells kind of to orchestrate inflammation and lead to blood vessel dilation and that is what precipitates not only redness but symptoms of itch and discomfort if you have hives histamine release is a major factor in the formation of hives you also have an increase in blood flow leading to more redness certain foods contain histamine and some people are actually intolerant to histamine there's an enzyme that breaks down histamine called diamine oxidase some people may have insufficient levels of that or insufficient activity of that enzyme so when this enzyme activity is impaired histamine accumulates can lead to symptoms of redness hives flushing rosacea symptoms it's estimated that up to one percent of the us actually has a histamine intolerance foods that are rich in histamine include aged cheeses smoked meats processed meats sauerkraut shellfish wine and to remind you not only here does wine have a good amount of histamine in it but its metabolites the breakdown of the alcohol can trigger histamine release as well eggplant avocado tomato and spinach so here we have tomato again tomato as a reminder is high in aldehyde and it's also rich in histamine so those two things together make it a food that a lot of people end up not tolerating especially those prone to rosacea but again to reiterate it's a trigger for some people but not for everyone if you've never had any issue with tomato based foods don't just go cutting them out randomly to see if it helps dietary factor number six that could be making your face red not as robust in terms of the research to support it but definitely worth mentioning and that is diets rich in fatty foods fatty cuts of meat lard and fried foods have been associated with worse rosacea and this may be due to the inflammatory effects of these foods on the body as a whole or it may be related to an imbalance in like the skin lipids leading to more water loss out of the skin those are merely speculative i would say more research really needs to be done to kind of nail this down but it makes sense to consider fatty foods as a potential trigger given that they can be quite inflammatory when i say fatty foods i'm specifically talking about fatty cuts of meat lard and fried foods i'm not talking about fat as a general macronutrient and last but not least is foods high in niacin niacin can definitely precipitate a flush niacin actually binds to receptors on the surface of a skin cell called the longer han cell and the downstream effect of that is release of inflammatory mediators namely prostaglandins that lead to blood vessel dilation niacin rich foods include poultry like chicken breast tuna salmon peanuts crustaceans and liver all right you guys so those are seven things that can be found in the diet and different types of foods that can trigger redness for some people but i want to make it clear what triggers redness for one person is not necessarily a trigger for everyone again don't just go cutting out stuff out of your diet my goal in making this video is merely to educate you as to the mechanisms in which certain compounds and different types of foods can lead to flushing and redness and people who are sensitive to those but it is by no means telling you cut these foods out so let me know those of you out there i know a lot of you deal with rosacea are any of these food categories problematic with you i know some of you are dealing with hives definitely alcohol i guess i would say while i told you not to cut anything out cutting alcohol out of your diet i see no harm in doing that but yeah let me know in the comments are any of these foods problematic for you alcohol again is a common trigger for itch redness hives and definitely a rosacea trigger for a lot of people i hope this was informative on the end slate i'm going to put my recent video where i talk about causes of facial redness so definitely check that out if that's something that you're coping with i go over a lot of reasons why your face may be red but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe i'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

that high protein breakfast so starting your day off with more protein that's going to keep you full and satiated throughout the day when you've got all those treats and the extra food around you so that's one of the things that you can do now if you do over eat one of the things that you can utilize is some plant-based enzymes so this is I've always got my go-to bottle of my enzymes of course in my kitchen with my other supplements and plant-based enzymes are great because they help to actually break down your food so that's something that I promise that we'll share some links in the description below this video so that you can learn some more about plant-based enzymes which is really important anybody who has gas bloating digestive issues this is something that can really help you in terms of having some great digestion happening for you because of course when your gas seeing bloated you don't feel comfortable and this can implicate other things in terms of what's going on with your gut and leaky gut syndrome which is something that we'll talk about now as we're going to start talking about rosacea so these are some of the common causes of rosacea some of which you probably have never heard about so one of them which goes against what you've heard is lack of natural sunlight exposure I know anybody who's been diagnosed with rosacea you know if you're watching this and you're saying yeah this is me the doctor told me to stay out of the Sun Well I say the opposite and based on the research is lack of natural sunlight exposure which puts you into a more inflammatory State and this is a problem one of those causes for rosacea as well as something that's very modern now in our Modern World Is Blue Light toxicity so this is something along with those man-made emfs so when we're talking about Wi-Fi signals and our cell phones and our tablets and all of these things that we have in terms of our devices this can actually increase that inflammatory response in our body and actually exasperate that rosacea as well when we talk about the gut so coming back to having that healthy digestion when we've got leaky gut and a lot of stomach problems this is something that again will aggravate and when we talk about the fat face mapping in terms of what's going on with the different channels in traditional Chinese medicine when we look at what's going on on the face this has a lot to do with what's happening with the internal organs and this part of the body so typically people will get that rosacea either on the red cheeks it can be around the eyes as well and that chronic inflammation is happening but the cheeks are related to the stomach and what's going on with digestion and that is where it can link back now in traditional Chinese medicine based on the meridians that run through our body back to what's going on with digestion and your gut so definitely fixing the leaky gut is going to be very helpful for that rosacea as well as exercise so this is something that if you exercise you may have an exercise induced rosacea this actually can happen to me sometimes after a hot yoga class and being very very hot my face gets like beat red if people wonder if there's anything wrong with me but it's not it's just that extra inflammation in and that blood flow that's coming to the surface and that's what of course you can experience with rosacea now if it's a chronic thing this can come and go and it is definitely going to be exasperated the less natural sunlight exposure you have and healthy sunlight exposure but also it can be related to that blue light toxicity that you've got from our all the artificial lights in your environment there's another culprit here and that is the Demodex Mite so if you don't know what that is these are little mites that live on the skin they can actually exasperate that inflammation in the skin with the rosacea as well I've got other videos on that so you can definitely check that out if you want some more information and what specifically to do about the Demodex mics and of course stress so we know that stress is always a culprit with most of chronic things that are happening in our body that'll make our leaky gut worse as well so that's something that you definitely want to do in terms of Now tips to help with that rosacea is to deal with your stress in a natural way okay so here are my nine tips for rosacea tip number one watch and is that natural sunlight exposure so especially when you wake up first thing in the morning get some of that natural sunlight on your skin it's really really helpful to decrease that inflammatory response and it helps to set up your body for that proper melatonin secretion later in the day which is also very anti-inflammatory so that's really important having that good night's sleep is important as well for your rosacea also you want to have some midday sun and at Sunset as well because those healing rays are going to be really helpful for calming down that inflammation and helping to actually heal the skin tip number two for rosacea if you are on a computer and you have to be on devices go near an open window that natural sunlight so make sure you open up that window but that natural light coming in that photonic effect of that natural sunlight coming in is going to help to counteract some of that blue light toxicity from the artificial lights in your home or in your office tip number three is don't use your cell phone in your eyes first thing when you wake up in the morning it's the worst that you can do what do most people do when you wake up you grab for your cell phone having that artificial blue light in your eyes first thing in the morning is terrible for your rosacea and for your skin and for your eyes as well it increases your inflammation and also after the sun has set you don't want to have those blue light devices in your face tip number four wear your blue light blocking glasses these can be really effective at helping to decrease that extra blue light coming into your eyes tip number five fertilization make sure that you are decreasing your stress and tip number six is now a little bit of research has been done on this ingredient iron oxide so this is often the pigment that's used that artists use in terms of making and mixing their paints and things but use topically along with carrot seed oil in this study it was found that the addition of the such pigments to the sunscreens actually it greatly enhancers the photo protection and has that cosmetic acceptability to the skin so being able to use it topically is something that's great again for rosacea and finding products that have that is difficult so stay tuned for for that as well as tip number seven your Healthy microbiome so getting that healthy gut doing regular parasite cleansing detoxes is something that I'm definitely all about putting the good guys back in those probiotics really important for your rosacea remember it's mapped so your your skin is mapping what's going on with your internal organs so getting that healthier gut is going to have a big influence on your rosacea tip number eight for rosacea have a healthy diet of course so a more anti-inflammatory diet so staying away from those pufas increasing your DHA so Seafood my favorite food group to help to give you those anti-inflammatory effects from those omega-3 fatty acids which is great and eating local foods and in seasoned Foods is also going to be very very helpful so we see apples being picked here is something that I did with the family this weekend we had so much fun I don't know how many people went apple picking I I it seems like everybody it seems like nobody if you live actually in a region that of course naturally grows apples this is something that we are all doing at this time of year and tip number nine for rosacea is that Mind Body Connection so this anything on the skin especially with chronic inflammatory issues with the skin acne as well there's something on that Mind Body level about disliking of yourself it has to do with your self-worth and we know that inflammatory conditions can be related to suppressed anger as well and everything is bubbling up to the surface so definitely working your way through some of these mind-body things is going to go a long way to help with that rosacea okay we're going over here we're going to do some exercise and this is known as one of the best exercises at least talked about types of exercise for weight loss and this has to do with the type of breathing that you're doing and so I'm going to hop on the treadmill here and let me see if I can get this baby going so what this is about is a certain type of breathing and it's called intermittent hypoxic breathing and what this is doing is it's helping to and what the research shows is that that hypoxia so that lack of oxygenation in this study showed increases your blood serotonin and decreases leptin levels while suppressing your appetite so not only is this working with helping you to get some exercise but also helping to decrease your leptin levels if you don't know what leptin is all about make sure you check out my other videos that's really important to fix your leptin resistance especially if you're looking to lose weight and you're having difficulty with the balancing of your hormones if you've got a lot of inflammation as well okay so the way that this is done and I'll explain it first before I demonstrate it so I don't like wipe out and Yeah that would make for a very different show but this is something that maybe if you've practice yoga before you've done the Breath of Fire so we're going to do the Breath of Fire it means breathing just through your nose 10 to 20 repetitions I'll probably do 10 just for demonstration purposes today so 10 times in and out through your nose then you're going to Exhale all of your breath out and then you're going to hold your breath and exercise and you're going to take as many steps as possible and you can do this in place so if you don't have your treadmill up and ready to go then you're just going to walk in place and you're going to take as many steps as possible with holding your breath then you're going to breathe in so you're going to take a deep breath in but then you're going to hold again and you're going to continue walking and ideally you count how many steps you can go through and that increases as the more you train within this hypoxic state but this and then you're going to go back to regular breathing okay are we ready should I do it on the treadmill yeah I yeah let's let I'm going to do it let's do it on the treadmill you never know what can happen in a live show so let's go let me set my speed let me get this going so it's not too crazy difficult for me as I explain this okay here we go so we're going to do the Breath of Fire and you guys need to come see me up here to do the breath breath of fire okay are we ready which camera am I on here okay here we go ready Breath of Fire so it's in and out ten times close your mouth and it's just through your nose and it's pretty quick so your your abdomen is going back and forth ready here we go yeah then you exhale everything out and hold your breath and see how many steps then you take a deep breath in and hold again and exhale and then breathe normally through your nose and this is now having an effect on your parasympathetic nervous system so it's actually helping to calm and relax this is a great exercise for anybody who has anxiety you've got challenges with stress and panic attacks throughout the day just go into a quiet place and do this exercise you don't need to do the walking part of it but this is fantastic and then you would repeat that again and you would repeat that whole series five to ten times and this is a great way with that breath holding and the longer you hold the breath the better of course do it in a safe environment where you know you don't want to pass out don't hold it to the point where oh yeah I can hold it longer and you know you don't want to hurt yourself but this is a great way that hypoxic training as shown in the research helps to burn more calories helps with balancing the hormones helps with your leptin levels and is a great way to train this is very similar if anybody's done the cold exposure the Wim Hof breathing and things like that very similar to that as well as if you train underwater this is something that's fantastic as well okay let's go back over here and we're going to talk about some of the deficiencies that you may have and some of the symptoms that you may have as this may be related to a certain type of mineral deficiency and I don't know if I should give it away to you right at the beginning but let's go through some of those symptoms and we'll see if you can guess what it is okay frequent colds and flus memory loss and difficulty remembering things as well as weak bones so calcium deposition in the bones is compromised if you have this mineral deficiency as well as poor thyroid function so your thyroid relies on this specific mineral I think I have to give it away now it's copper so if you're low in Copper your thyroid will be compromised you can have poor bone density because we need copper in order for that calcium metabolism to be optimized memory loss the frequent colds and flues your immune system you need that copper as well as skin patches and little white spots if you do have Vitiligo this can be related to a copper deficiency as well because copper is needed by the enzymes to produce the melanin so that pigmentation in the skin graying of the hair can be related to a copper deficiency as well and poor vision so in terms of having proper Vision this is something important that we have and are balancing our copper levels so here are some of the best foods for copper maybe you're eating these but I find a lot of people don't eat enough of these specific foods and I picked some of my favorites here of course so at the top of the list with just one ounce of beef liver is giving you 450 eight percent of the recommended daily intake for copper beef liver not everybody's going to love beef liver so I added some other Foods on the list oysters 133 percent Lobster my favorite one cup of lobster 141 percent of the recommended daily intake of your copper every day as well on the list we have squid so that calamari which I love dark chocolate another one of my favorites will give you some copper as well oats are great as well sesame seeds sunflower seeds mushrooms have some copper which is amazing and almonds so dry roasted almonds one ounce will give you just 14 of the RDI of your copper so I hope this is great you're just tuning in thank you for tuning in today we are going to go over and I'm going to make my famous awesome delicious high protein low carb but fantastic gingerbread loaf so we are going over there in just a second but first I want to share our viewer Spotlight so each week on the show we share some positive feedback from one of our great followers and I want to say and say thank you to Ariel baby 23 and I'm guessing it's a she said Hello thank you so much for your advice it helps me a lot to understand my hormones and body better so thank you so much Ariel baby and please keep all of those positive comments coming throughout the episodes and you may be featured as one of our viewer spotlights so we thank you for that okay we are in the kitchen so this is my great low carb high protein gingerbread cake very similar in taste and experience to the one that you may go at that famous coffee shop I won't mention it but I love it but this is without the carbs without the sugar without the bad fats and there's no guilt here and it's great and it's high in protein which is amazing okay are we ready to get started here so we've got our bowl and at first I'm going to and I'm going to mix everything into here but first we're starting with some eggs so we have a half a cup of butter and we also have some eggs and I'm going to blend that together with my now you never know what's going to happen on a live show with with making recipes with Dr Janine because things happen and it's never to disappoint it's always going to be interesting okay so here we go I'm going to blend this up hopefully we've got everything functional here and no there we go so blending up four eggs with a half a cup of butter as well as some sweeteners so this is the thing when you're using and making recipes and this is tested and true recipe that I've made several times ongoing because it just so is so fantastic but now we're adding in our sweetener and the sweetener is one of this one is a monk fruit sweetener but this is a great way without the carbohydrates and great and it's keto friendly to be able to get that going so there we go [Applause] and so you're basically going to blend up your wet ingredients until that's nice and Incorporated now we are in Canada and it's a little bit cold here so my butter isn't as nice and melted as what I would love but then we are also going to add our dry ingredients together and then we're going to incorporate everything okay so in here I have some coconut flour as well as some almond flour so and we'll we'll be posting this entire recipe so don't worry you will see it as we will have it so we've got coconut flour we have our almond flour we also have our two scoops of our protein powder so you can either use unflavored or you can also use the vanilla flavored and that's the Whey Protein Isolate so make sure that it's an ice lip because you I don't want you to have any tummy issues so you'll see the full description in the video below now we also now this is a secret ingredient this is the fiber supplement so this is psyllium seed husk I actually used a product and opened up the capsules of that and that was 24 capsules of the vitamucil opened up and this is a binder that helps to bind everything together as well as our spices so we have some ginger some cinnamon and of course our cloves and some ground nutmeg together in there a little bit of salt and I'm going to incorporate all of my dry ingredients together and of course our baking powder you need something to make it nice and leavened and Rising I am also adding into the wet so I'm just going to let that incorporate a little bit more I'm adding a tablespoon of molasses into my wet mixture here we go so adding this in and and I I bought an organic molasses of course at the health food store and that's going to give it some of that rich color as well now if you're strict keto of course you don't have to use the Molasses you can do it without the Molasses but I I like that I've tried this recipe without the molasses and it didn't it didn't do it for me it just needed a little bit of that flavor of the of the for the gingerbread loaf of that molasses and the color as well I like it to be a little bit on the darker side so there we go we incorporate that in and then I will be adding the wet to the dry or the dry to the wet to me and my recipes it doesn't really matter I don't know I don't know does anybody know why they make those differences as to one into the other I'm sure the professional Bakers out there you're either loving this or you're cringing right now to my technique as to what's going on with my gingerbread Loaf and then we just incorporate everything in together now I sort of gauge the the wetness of the batter and because we have that psyllium seed husk and oh the smell if you could smell this if there was smell-o-vision it's just Divine so you need a little bit of that water because remember we put the fiber into the loaf and that water is going to combine with that psyllium seed husk fiber and that is going to be something that is going to give it that sort of what's the word I'm looking for cohesiveness to keep it all together so you do need that water as much as it seems like it's a little bit it's wet enough on its own as that psyllium seed husk is now drawing in that water you do need to add that quarter cup of water in there okay so there we go and then we go into now I prepared my loaf pan that's going into with the parchment paper that's going to go in my batter oh can we see this so not so good with the there we go so that's going into my loaf pan I've preheated the oven to 350 degrees of course and that is all going in there and then that is going to bake for about 35 minutes or so your ovens are all different so I realize that and forgive my there we go here we go [Music] it's the magic of a live show here we go here is the loaf so then of course we also have the recipe for the and I'll pop that out really quickly we also have the recipe for the cream cheese icing which is also low carb so you're just going to and you will share that recipe as well and then you're going to dollop that on top I'll just do it like this voila I'll just put a little piece here on the end oh yummy and I was when I test these recipes at the house I have to put I have to put signs all over everything don't touch don't touch oh well lets me do the whole thing here we go there we go nice and yes and the whole crew is going to want some

absolutely delicious you will love it and as much as we do because it's all of the flavor without the guilt and it it is packed with protein remember we added the protein powder in there there's a ton of eggs in there as well and it is fantastic so I can't wait for you all to try that okay we're going to go back over here we are going to do a little bit of beauty some beauty exercises so here we go and yeah yeah so great to be here today thank yous for joining us and this is our time to talk Beauty so when we talk about the muscles around the eyes if you are experiencing the forehead wrinkles so this is something that one of the things that I want you to be conscientious of if you do have the lines and the forehead wrinkles is the way that you open your eyes if you're very expressive you may be using the wrong muscles you actually could be using some of these muscles here when you open your eyes and I don't want you to do that because at any time you're exasperating and having a lot of facial expressions for your eyes just use the orbicularis oculi muscle to be expresses with your eyes so instead of doing this kind of thing just use your eye muscles and there's a big difference so just practice that at home that's a it's one that consciously you have to think about because I'm one of those people who uses like a lot of facial muscles for my facial expressions which is a good thing I think but not so much when you're aging and you start to see some lines and wrinkles so that's something that consciously just use that orbicularis oculine muscle around the eyes to open your eyes now the other thing if you are getting a lot of lines and wrinkles on the forehead is you may have a lot of tension in your scalp and your scalp muscles so this is something that if you're seeing hair loss happening as well that can be because of lack of circulation so one of the things that I love to do when I can is to do scalp massage okay so everybody I want you to do this right now just get your hands in there and just massage your scalp and there's going to be certain points on your scalp that are going to feel really tense and you're going to be feeling a lot of pain but this is something that you definitely want to work out that tension and as you work out this tension in the scalp it actually will help to relax these muscles in the forehead as well so there you go I want you to do all of that you are going to love the results of relaxing things especially for those forehead wrinkles so there we have it today we talked all about rosacea we talked about copper deficiency and some of the signs and symptoms of a copper deficiency and what to look for also we made my famous gingerbread cake I can't wait for you to try that recipe please let me know how it goes for you it's absolutely delicious without the guilt and it is high protein and we and I showed you some of the best exercise so that breathing technique or that hypoxic training for weight loss which is amazing great for anxiety and stress as well which you will love and I hope that you try that as well do it carefully remember and you know watch this video back a few times to really master that technique one of my goals is to teach you how to empower yourself over the healing of your own Body Mind and Spirit be well everyone we'll see you in a couple of weeks",

research that i recently came across connecting what are known as mast cells and rosacea just the other week dermatology times published an article called a new target for rosacea treatment the mast cell towards the end of the article the authors specifically pointed out the most common food triggers identified by the national rosacea society including high histamine foods such as yogurt cheese sour cream soy yeast extract and chocolate in some people this additional histamine from food exposure can trigger mast cells to degranulate and release histamine for people with rosacea it seems to trigger an influx of mast cells as well as higher activity that's found in facial skin this appears to be in line with other research that suggests that rosacea flare-ups could be the result of neuropeptide production that in turn quote induces catholicism production end quote in mast cells the more i dig the more research that i find connecting the dots between the destabilization of mast cells to the various symptoms associated with rosacea what's really interesting to me is that i get alerts daily about new drug therapies for rosacea it's rare though that those alerts point at research like this even though this information clearly exists in the literature and is being actively studied so then why aren't we looking deeper than creams and medications to help people struggling with rosacea especially given that mast cell issues typically have an effect throughout the body so what if rosacea flare-ups are a sign of something else going on in your body and not the ultimate problem i can't say for sure but it's certainly interesting food for thought right let's hold up for a moment you've heard me say the phrase masked cells a few times now but you might not know what they are a mast cell is a type of white blood cell that has a pretty big role to play in your body a high concentration of the cells that ultimately create mast cells are found in your gut specifically in your small intestine mast cells are found in both mucous membranes and epithelial tissue and are involved in quote allergy asthma anaphylaxis gastrointestinal disorders many types of malignancies and cardiovascular diseases end quote inside mast cells they have these granules that act like little warehouses for a bunch of different inflammatory agents in your body that include quote histamine heparin a variety of cytokines chondroitin sulfate and neutral proteases end quote these substances are released when mast cells degranulate essentially the granules open their doors to release what they hold within when mast cells become increasingly triggered you can find that you've become intolerant to histamines or you develop a condition called mast cell activation syndrome if you never heard of mast cells before it's probably because this particular issue isn't a very mainstream concept yet there's more research coming out on mast cells but it can be difficult to find help i initially learned about mast cells years ago when i stumbled across the work of a journalist named yasmina who ran a website called healinghistamine.com though yasmina has since passed away back in 2018 her website survives and has a lot of great information on it according to a presentation that i sat in on at the integrative health symposium back in february of 2020 in new york city by dr ann hayden the following can trigger mast cells to degranulate histamine exposure lectins gliadin which comes from gluten stress which means both external triggers and internal stress triggers toxins certain drugs heat or cold lipopolysaccharides also known as lps which are produced in the gut by exposure to certain saturated fats such as coconut oil and also ige and other non-ige triggers it's crucial for you to know that mast cell issues go beyond just allergy symptoms as the previous list of their involvement suggests symptoms can be widespread and look like a very confusing constellation of random symptoms as an example mast cells in the gut can cause diarrhea when they encounter something problematic by increasing fluid secretion and peristalsis and what that means is we get more water into the gut tube so to speak and we see this increase in undulations that push things through to get something out of your system other symptoms of histamine exposure from mast cells shared by dr ann hayden include fatigue headache or migraine nausea and vomiting chills hives gerd rashes abdominal pain diarrhea constipation anxiety ticks or tremors burning mouth depression memory difficulty hypertension chest pain feeling cold or having the sweats and the list goes on and on and you can see why this could be difficult for a doctor to piece together if you listen to the healthy skin show sequentially you might recall dr leonard weinstock he talked about the high incidence of small intestine bacterial overgrowth also known as sibo in rosacea patients to connect the dots between mast cells a 2019 study published by dr weinstock found that almost 31 percent of people with mast cell activation had sibo while not everyone with rosacea has sibo it is worth reiterating just how prevalent having sibo is a small study published in the journal of american academy of dermatology found that quote patients with rosacea were 13 times more likely to have sibo compared with controls end quote and sometimes the bugs in the gut happen to produce more histamine than other bugs depending on the makeup of your gut's microbiome it might surprise you to know that there are some friendly gut bugs that naturally produce histamine such as lactobacillus acidophilus and there are other not so friendly bugs that make histamine too including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella ornithinolitica these should not be confused with klebsiella pneumoniae which does not produce histamines these unfriendly bugs can pop up on stool testing i've seen a number of clients that appear to have histamine intolerance but it turned out that a major factor was gut dysbiosis with bugs that were also producing extra histamine as well one interesting final trigger yasmina mentioned that demodex mites may also trigger mast cells over on her website if you're interested in learning more about demodex mites dr leo actually discussed them on episode 136 of the healthy skin show in regards to resolving rosacea since i started out this episode mentioning that rosacea trigger foods also happen to be high histamine foods i figured it was time to circle back on that point i don't want to go too deep into the woods on this topic today because as i'm sure you can tell this could be a very long conversation i do not consider myself to be a histamine expert but it is something that many of my clients struggle with on a daily basis whether they've got rosacea or even sometimes eczema i'm gonna be straight with you a low histamine diet is really really hard to follow for an extended period of time and for some people it's pretty difficult to follow period there are some foods that naturally contain more histamine than others most of which are aged pickled dried smoked processed or fermented canned foods are typically a problem as well and there are fresh foods that just happen to have a higher histamine content like avocados spinach tomato pineapple and spices however the bigger challenge is that if you really are sensitive to histamines cooked food increases in histamine concentration the longer it sits after cooking it even in the fridge freezing a freshly cooked meal immediately helps to stop this histamine production but this is why i say a low histamine diet can be really difficult so you can see why only addressing this from an elimination diet perspective may not be truly practical especially long term and given that other triggers are possible it makes sense to look at this from a broader perspective in the meantime it may be worthwhile to check out some natural antihistamine support such as quercetin which helps stabilize mast cells and has antihistamine properties nettles which is an herb that has antihistamine properties and diamine oxidase also known as dao this is a supplement to help you break down histamine in the gut just be aware that dao supplements are not the same as typical digestive enzymes and would need to be taken with your other digestive support not in lieu of it if you unfortunately have an allergy to pork or you avoid pork in your diet be aware that dao is typically derived from pigs now obviously these three suggestions are for your information before trying any of them discuss them with your practitioner to make sure that they're right for you and will not negatively interact with something else that you are taking i think it's important to point out that mast cell issues can be complicated to say the least and it may not be as straightforward as just following a diet to get your rosacea flare-ups to stop unfortunately there can be a number of triggers that cause mast cells to degranulate if you've already been avoiding the common trigger foods pretty religiously and still get flares it's time to dig deeper i hope this episode gives you some real food for thought about your rosacea it can be incredibly frustrating to deal with and equally embarrassing i'm excited to share more information coming up soon about histamine diets as well as rosacea episodes from both a clinical perspective but also from people going through this just like you that's why it's important to share this episode with other rosacea warriors to help them find answers to what is driving their flares if you've been struggling with rosacea i'd love to hear your questions comments or

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "published_at": "2021-01-14T18:19:20Z",
        "transcript": "do you have acne or do you have acne rosacea they are different and it's really important to know the difference so today i'm going to share the characteristics that define acne rosacea plus my favorite tool for getting really clear on your root acne triggers so stay until the end for that hi there i'm jill therese and after 15 years of dealing with acne i finally cleared my acne naturally and i created my acne clearing program the clear coat to help you do the same seven years and thousands of clients later i've made up my life's work to get you clear skin without hormones creams and or pills so make sure you subscribe to my program subscribe to my channel and hit the bell to be notified when i post a new video so first things first i'm not a dermatologist and it's really important that you get a diagnosis of acne rosacea from a dermatologist before you do much else like everything it's really hard to take action on something if you aren't clear on the root cause so knowing if you have acne rosacea acne vulgaris a different type of acne altogether is really important and i'm not a dermatologist so fyi that being said since i help people heal acne naturally i come across acne rosacea quite often and here is what i see here are the four most common characteristics of acne rosacea the first defining characteristic of acne rosacea is that acne rosacea commonly presents with packles papules and pustules not comedones whiteheads or blackheads so with acne vulgaris specifically you'll see whiteheads you know like it'll be like pus-filled whiteheads whereas and like more cystic stuff whereas oftentimes when i see acne rosacea it'll be more a series of little bumps this is not a scientific term this is just what i see it'll be a series of bumps in an area but they won't be as inflamed the way kind of acne bulgaris typically looks does that sound like you comment below if yes if you're like oh my gosh i i don't have any white heads any blackheads no no kind of like um cystically inflamed things but i have a ton of tiny little bumps concentrated in an area that's often very red comment below if that's you that last description leads us to our second kind of characteristic of acne rosacea and that is that it's centralized on the face often so you'll see it here here here maybe here and far less like along your hairline on your jawline underneath your chin around your mouth the third defining characteristic of acne rosacea sadly is that it's often seen in women over age of 30. i see men can get it but i have seen it gosh almost exclusively in clients between 35 and 42 years old the fourth defining characteristic of acne rosacea is that it's episodic and so by that i mean it's not all the time so some questions to ask yourself about this situation do you feel really flush after you take a bath or a hot shower after a few hot hours in the sun do you feel really red and kind of irritated do you feel red and irritated after a glass of wine do you eat certain foods and feel an almost immediate flush of warmth if you can answer yes to any of those questions you may be dealing with some type of acne rosacea in this large discussion of triggers that naturally leads us to ask how do we treat it so i have a good news and bad news the good news is that there's no technical cure for acne rosacea but there are methods of action that you can take to really help calm a lot of the symptoms the most important thing with acne rosacea is defining your triggers and they're different for everyone i have seen very different triggers for very different people some of the most common triggers for acne rosacea here are eight of them exercise heat in general hot showers saunas the bath hot hours in the sun any extreme emotion like anger or excitement if you find yourself getting really flushed like after an argument which i think i mean all of us would naturally but yours will be very specific to your skin caffeine alcohol spicy foods now i know you're listening to all this and you're crying because all those things are either fun relaxing and or social but i really don't want you to worry because once you get clear on your root triggers for this rosacea flare-up everything is much easier and i personally usually only see two to three triggers at a time so for example let's say you wake up in the morning this is an example of a day that could be really triggering for rosacea you wake up and you go for a run but it's the summer and it's really hot outside so you go for a hot run because it's hot you start sweating and maybe you're like exposed to the sun while you're out there then when you get back from your run you take a hot shower then you grab a hot coffee then you go meet a friend in the park a few hours later and it's hot and you're exposed to the sun and you have less wine all that that's kind of a bad day for an acne rosacea person but that being said i would bet that maybe only two or three of those details were the most impactful for you so here are the action steps you can take to start to moderate acne rosacea on your own the first thing that i would do is to get a food life journal you won't have to do this forever so don't freak out too much because i know that kind of chronically in your entire life can be exhausting but knowing your triggers is really important i swear once you're aware of the cause of the breakouts and the cause of the flare-ups it just it'll totally change your world because you'll finally be more in control of what's happening with your skin the second action step you want to take is to begin a gentle af skincare protein okay nothing crazy if you're using things like vitamin c's retinoids astringents toners all together and you're already dealing with this type of kind of irritated skin barrier which can happen sometimes with acne rosacea you want to be really careful and i'd recommend tapering off those products gently so one cream that i love recommending for acne rosacea clients is vanna cream and it's a moisturizer and it's really gentle and easy and if you are not moisturizing with acne rosacea it's just going to make it worse so i would find the gentlest moisturizer you can find and begin to taper off slowly and strategically some of your more active products okay another thing that would be kind of a no-brainer for you at this point will be to start to use spf really religiously you want to be really thoughtful and strategic about that use it consistently and make sure that if you're under the sun at all you have spf on so those are the three action steps that i would take begin a food journal start to really simplify your skin care routine and make sure you're really really religious about your spf when you're dealing with acne rosacea you can always see a dermatologist too but those are the things that you want to kind of take action on immediately to define whether or not you're dealing with vaccinations okay so i would really like to help you from an action perspective at this point too the first thing that you can do if you want to get a little bit more clear on your route acne traders is to download and take my 30 second 10 question acne personality quiz you can find that via the link below and it'll help you define where you're breaking out give you three action steps that you can start to take to heal your acne naturally along with three recipes you can try also if you want to join a safe private and empathetic community of people who are dealing with things just

        "transcript": "is there a connection between your gut and rosacea scientists are researching this link between your gut microbiome and rosacea we know that we have got microorganisms in our gut we know this and we know that they affect our health now the British Journal of Dermatology has found that people with gastrointestinal problems like IBS usually also suffer from rosacea can change in your diet really affect and help your rosacea yes so we know that everyone with rosacea has certain triggers certain foodstuffs and drinks that aggravate their skin condition we know that but there is proof now that probiotics taking probiotics can absolutely reduce your rosacea symptoms so probiotics we get them from yogurt and from food supplements and they are known as the happy healthy good bacteria and we take probiotics they restore the balance of good bacteria or the gut bacteria and that will impact on your rosacea reducing it and also it is known to help irritable bowel syndrome how do you identify what foods stuffs and drinks are causing your or aggravating your flare-ups of rosacea what's triggering your rosacea keep a food diary I think that's a great way to go get a notepad and start writing down when you have flare-ups what foods you were eating at that time so you know we know that there'll be certain triggers that's aggravating you could it could be even chocolate for example but it's really rotten isn't it you can't eat any more chocolate but you really have to look at that what's causing it and eliminating it from your diet and thinking knowing that rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that's probably the keywords there so you need to be looking at anti-inflammatory food lists and focusing on them and getting them into your your daily nutrition your daily diet so foods that can trigger rosacea okay listen up to this spicy food support spices like paprika cumin Cayenne or black pepper dairy yogurt cheese and sour cream sugar always a culprit for skin and sugar causes this inflammation in the skin alcohol particularly red wine champagne and beer hot drinks including tea coffee and hot chocolate I really hate to tell you about all those things but you really have to give a big go be strong and eliminate those from a diet and you will see your skin changing you will see changing a promise foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "hi my name is jack carr i'm a video director and i came to pos clinic because of my rosacea [Music] i think i've had rosacea for the last 10 years maybe 15 years in the early stages i probably didn't know what it was yeah just realizing that it was rosacea in the last i would say 10 to 8 years i've decided to treat my rosacea because i'm getting a little bit older now and i think rosacea in time gets worse and if you don't treat it it just progresses so it's better to get on top of it when you can my skin goals are honestly to stop myself having too many flushes too much of the the acne that that occurs when you have rosacea when i came to the clinic i was given some food intolerance tests and they were they told me that they were going to give me a certain amount of laser treatments so far i've had my third treatment i believe i had my food intolerance test and by a lovely lady named lisa borg who has given me a diagnosis and it turns out that i've got a leaky gut doesn't sound very nice but it's very common with your gut health you know gut health is everything as they say and once you fix the root of the problem your body and your immune system can fight and run as normal or more normal so an anti-inflammatory diet as far as i know is is a great way to get your gut health back into check and in doing that you know reducing eating some of these inflammatory foods that aren't great for my system so yeah i've been intolerant to yeast pineapple and egg whites they're like the high high one i had the high end ones i mean look yeast is a hard thing to cut out because it's in so many sources but you can do it you just have to read the instructions it's very daunting at the beginning but actually when you start doing it and taking control and seeing like a change and feeling different uh it's worth it and it's it's definitely worth it so after doing my treatment i definitely saw some progress early on you know i came in and my skin was quite irritated um so straight away just from the diet uh you're gonna notice change but i noticed some change and then as soon as i came in and i already seen some change and having the pulse light therapy you know reduce some of the redness in in the burst blood vessels um and the combination obviously is a winning combination yeah just start feeling a bit more confident what happens is and it will it you know you've got to be honest with it you might see change and then you might have an outbreak which might dishearten you but it's a long game like you've got you've got to keep at this you've got to keep on the diet you've got to keep you know even doing top-ups on on these treatments it's still early stages so i am still going to have irritations and things that happen it's not all perfect but my skin feels better i feel better consistency is key i think i would recommend pulsed light clinic due to the way i've felt treated good information reasonable price i think i mean to be honest i didn't shop around too much you know i just like the vibe here but you know for me just being able to talk to the people that work here and know what i'm getting and why i'm getting it it feels quite transparent so if you suffer from rosacea don't suffer in silence just know that do your research um come to a pulselight clinic get a free consultation they're going to advise you on what to do it's daunting i understand it from a personal point of view you know you don't want to even talk about rosacea you don't even want to admit that you have it or say it in front of someone because it brings attention to people looking at you but i promise you taking that first step it can change your life and yeah i can't recommend it more thanks for watching peace [Music]",

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "hey friends welcome back to another wellness wednesday i'm coming to you from my pantry today because i just recently realized that i actually get really good lighting in my pantry and it's a little bit secluded and it's getting very cold right now so the porch was not as comfortable of an option as it used to be so we're having a pantry chat today uh in this video i'll give you an update on how things are going with like after my october hello hi what's he doing for me yeah bring it over here i don't have kittens here i have children i made this what is that it's he does have mouth is it so awesome yeah all right you go play i'm gonna finish talking okay okay okay so i finished up my alternating lean and fat days experiment for the month of october and i told you last week that i decided to take a week off before jumping into anything else that's always nerve-wracking after you've just lost some weight going back to normal is kind of scary because sometimes weight can jump right back up but i was really thankful that i actually lost another pound in the week where i went back to eating my regular keto 4 diet so i think one of the great things about alternating the regular days in with the lower fat days is that when i went back to all regular days my body didn't like have a huge freak out because it was used to eating all those foods and having those breaks where i had a regular diet with a regular amount of calories so anyways it was just encouraging to see the weight still continue to go down it just makes me more convinced that i'm on the right track and my body is responding well to what i'm doing so as far as moving forward i told you last week that i was taking a week off and then i was gonna jump into three days a week of lean days and then the rest of the day's regular days and um so i started that this past saturday so today so i had a lean day on saturday and then i had sunday monday as regular days which was nice having those back-to-back and then tuesday uh yesterday was a lean day and then today i'm on a higher fat day and so far that's going well i think i'm really gonna like the three days a week rather than every other day um that just it's a lot and so it wasn't it's not like it was bad that i did it but i don't think i should do that necessarily long term but i still definitely have weight to lose so i think three days a week is a really good number i also am not super strict on the protein sparing modified fast rules because when you do protein sparing modified fast you're supposed to keep your calories around 800 and i never i don't think i've ever gone that low i'm usually around a thousand sometimes as high as like 1200 and that's just how much i need in order to not be hungry and that's really important to me i think for me if i lose weight while being hungry it messes me up hormonally and i don't think the weight loss that i get that way is gonna stick at least that's what i've experienced before when i've gone on different diets the weight loss for me that sticks is the weight loss that i achieve while keeping my hunger under control so it's way more important to me to keep my hunger under control than to hit like that low calorie number so anyways i don't know if it would be bad for me to do the kind of lean days i'm doing every other day long term it might be fine just because i'm not keeping my calories that super low but it does get you know mentally tiring to do it long term it does take effort and i think just having the stability in my schedule of just having the three days a week that are the same every week and then having two days off in a row i think that's just gonna be good for me longer term because this is not like a crash diet where i'm gonna lose a ton of weight and then go back to the way i was eating before even after i lose the weight i'm gonna have to still incorporate some kind of a lean day schedule you know just to keep the weight from coming back i mean it could be that i can just go back to eating my regular keto 4 diet every day and be fine but i expect that if i see the scale going up i'll like jump on a lean day do that until the scale goes back down and then move on from there but that's just you know what i'm guessing and i still have a ways to go until i get to a goal weight so i talked some about my rosacea last week that i kind of thought was acne at first and then realized it was connected to the rosacea i had had forever i got a lot of helpful comments about rosacea last week from that video so thank you to those of you who gave suggestions and basically my approach pretty much to anything health related is that i try to do everything i can like through diet and lifestyle stuff and if that doesn't fix it then go to you know simple natural over-the-counter type things really you know give that a good shot and then when all else fails go to something stronger like prescription go to the doctor i'm not against getting prescriptions i'm not against any of that stuff as long as it's called for so basically what i decided to do at this point since diet wasn't really doing the trick to really take care of the rosacea i decided to get some over-the-counter stuff so i did some research not a ton i just kind of found some people that seemed like they knew what they were talking about and ordered what they recommended and so far it's actually been really really good um my skin is still red on my face but like the bumps have mostly gone so that's really good that was kind of the worst because i've had like the red on my face forever that's just kind of normal for me so just to get that acne looking stuff off that was the biggest thing but i'll show you the things that i did pick up so i got four different over-the-counter things and they were all pretty cheap it wasn't anything extraordinarily expensive so i got um first thing is some sulfur cream and i guess you can get sulfur soap too but i opted for the cream and sometimes rosacea can be caused by a reaction to dust mites that are just always around so i guess the sulfur cream helps get rid of those so that can be a help as long as that's the cause of the rosacea so i've been using this it recommends using it once a day so i do this like in the afternoon since i have like four different topical things i kind of have to make a schedule of when i use things instead of just putting them all on my face at the same time and then the other thing i got here is azoleic acid and this is the 10 version um you can get higher percentages but they have to be by prescription so this is the kind that you can get without a prescription and they just call it a multi-functional brightening formula and i don't have all the info of like why all these things work and what all they're supposed to do but i will put a video up in the cards um that i found helpful that talked about this kind of thing and i did notice like an immediate effect with this just like a smoothing my skin so that seems like it's working pretty well the other thing i got is this procure rosa care and it has a bunch of things and it's a very natural list of ingredients there's licorice extract and a bunch of other like natural things that are supposed to help with rosacea but one interesting thing is that the cream is green it has some greens in it and since red and green are opposites on the color wheel that when you put it on it's supposed to you know kind of just lessen the effect of the red just because of the contrast which i thought was kind of interesting and then the last thing i got was just a night moisturizer cetaphil redness prone skin and just put that on right before bed so basically what i'm doing is these two in the morning after my shower and then at some point in the afternoon i try to do the sulfur cream and then in the evening i do both of these again and then right before bed i do the moisturizer and so far it seems to be going well i'm not going to say it's i'm magically cured or anything but i have definitely seen improvement so that's all i have to chat about on this wellness wednesday today hope you guys are all doing great i love chatting with you down in the comments so i'll see you down there and i will see you in another video",

        "transcript": "if you have ocular rosacea\u00a0\nor even just regular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 this video is for you. Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "channel_title": "Michele Lee, MD",
        "description": "Ocular rosacea is the most underdiagnosed form of dry eye that I see every day in my clinic! If you have red, itchy, and burning ...",
        "published_at": "2022-01-08T13:57:09Z",
        "transcript": "Hi I\u2019m Dr. Michele Lee, a board-certified\nophthalmologist, and in this video I am going to address a very common and underdiagnosed\ncause of dry eye: ocular rosacea. So let\u2019s start by talking about rosacea. Rosacea is a skin condition of the mid-face\nthat affects up to 20% of people. People with rosacea are typically prone to\na long blush or flush that can resemble a sunburn, acne-like bumps referred to as papules\nor pustules, or skin texture changes. Rosacea tends to start around middle-age,\nin cycles, and is usually triggered by sun exposure, heat, stress, red wine and other\nalcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. While we don\u2019t really understand the mechanism\nof rosacea, we do know this is an inflammatory condition with an abnormal immune system response,\nand that there is a genetic component to this condition. There are multiple theories on why some people\nget rosacea, including theories linking the bacteria in our gut or small intestine bacterial\novergrowth and mites called Demodex that may be inducing skin inflammation. There are 4 types of rosacea and many people\naffected by rosacea may experience more than one type. Besides ocular or eye rosacea, which I will\nget to later in the video, there is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which is characterized by a prolonged\nblush and persistent redness of the face. With this type of rosacea, you can often see\nenlarged small blood vessels on the skin. Another type is papulopustular rosacea, which\nis characterized by whitehead pustules, which are red and pus-filled blemishes on the cheeks,\nchin, and forehead that are often confused with acne. The most rare and severe form is phymatous\nrosacea, which can result in thickening and discoloration of the skin. Phymatous rosacea usually affects the nose\nand is more common in men than women. So how does this condition affect our eyes? Well, this is a disease of the mid-face, and\nguess what is also in our mid-face? Our lower eyelids! In ocular rosacea, we see inflammation of\nour lower eyelids, classically lid margin telangiectasias. This is easily seen and noted with the slit-lamp\nmicroscope we use in our eye clinic. In ocular rosacea, eyelid inflammation can\ncause blockage of the meibomian, or oil, glands that provide the oil layer of our tears. Having blocked oil glands can cause a form\nof evaporative dry eye, where you make tears but don\u2019t make good quality tears to lubricate\nyour eyes and make you more prone to styes and chalazia, which are caused by blocked\nsweat and oil glands on the eyelids. In addition to dry eye, the eyelids can feel\nirritated and itchy from all the inflammation. In general, there are multiple treatments\nfor rosacea, many of which are beyond the scope of this video on ocular or eye rosacea. First and foremost, preventing and avoiding\ntriggers is the most effective thing you can do. If you suffer from rosacea, please consult with your dermatologist about a treatment plan for your\nskin that might work for you. For ocular rosacea, the treatment principles\nare similar to treating rosacea of the skin. There are a few levels of treatments that\nI discuss with my patients, depending on severity of disease and previous response to medications. Just like with skin rosacea, we want to avoid\nflares, whatever that may be. For some, this includes avoiding heat and\nwarm compresses to the eyes and eyelids, which is unfortunately an effective treatment for\nalmost every other type of dry eye. With minor irritation or symptoms, lubricating\neye drops, specifically preservative-free eye artificial tears, work best. Just how inflamed rosacea skin is sensitive,\nthe eyes and eyelids of rosacea patients are usually sensitive as well and avoiding any\ntriggers, including unnecessary preservatives, can be helpful. If preservative-free tears are not enough,\nwe might need to escalate treatment to a short-term, low-dose steroid eye drop for flares. We never want to stay on steroids for a long\ntime if we can help it, as steroid eye drops for years, even at low doses, can accelerate\ncataracts and elevate eye pressure in a small percentage of patients. Just like with other types of skin rosacea,\noral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines like doxycycline, can be effective in some cases\nof ocular rosacea. Doxycycline at low doses (under 50mg) has\nanti-inflammatory properties that both clinically and symptomatically can help with rosacea\nwhen taken long term. A newer treatment for rosacea and ocular rosacea\nis Intense Pulsed Light or IPL, a laser treatment that has been used for hyperpigmentation of\nthe skin and other types of rosacea and is now being increasingly used for ocular rosacea. This treatment can be effective with multiple\nuses, and there are some eye doctors who use a specific ocular protocol for ocular rosacea\nwith notable success. While this is still not a common tool in every\neye clinic, this is becoming increasingly popular and we might be seeing this tool in\nmore eye clinics as a treatment option for this form of dry and irritated eyes and eyelids. Do you think you might have ocular rosacea? Let me know in the comments below. As a rosacea patient myself, I am very passionate\nabout spreading awareness of rosacea and would love your support so please like and subscribe\nto my channel, and see you next week in my next video. Bye!",

        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi and welcome to me rx and my name is brooke i'm a coach here at meet rx and i'm so happy to be talking to david today all the way from sweden hello david thank you hello brooke great to be on the meet rx show so i'm really really happy for this so thank you for inviting me yeah thank you for taking the time to share with us um share your story with the carnivore diet and we all want to know what brought you to this to this meaty diet ah to make a long story short prior to my carnivore diet i was low carb for five years and the reason why i went low carb from the beginning was that i wanted to improve my running i wanted to be able to not to bonk and you know keep on running and some guy you know handing me a book and about running on my using my fat as fuel and once i started that you know i felt much much better my the few pounds that had around my belly got lost so i just went all in and i got my family with me and then like five years later this crazy dog on twitter uh dr sean baker was speaking about an all be typed and uh you know give it a try for third days i think it was actually talking about 90 days at that time and um yeah and then i suddenly remember what my old grandfather used to say you know if you don't have proper meat enough meat on the table on the table when you're dining it's not a proper meal because the most nutritious part of the of the dinner is the meat so and that you know caught my attention and i told my wife you know i'm gonna give this a try for 60 days for 30 days and she said you know you're not getting my support but well well i did it anyway and just after five five or seven days i noticed huge change with some issues that i had and after 30 days no i gave it a try i felt great and i stopped and when i brought the veggies back they just came back straight away so yeah that's my short story of my transition to the carnivore diet what were those specific symptoms that plants i i had rashes like rosacea in my face uh small blisters uh it was itching um it felt like i like like i had an alcohol problem lots of i was rather red in my face all the time and it was itching and i was when i looked myself in the air it felt like i had an alcohol problem when you see someone who's drinking lots of alcohol booze you notice that red paint that red tone in the face on the nose on the cheeks that's how i felt and uh as soon as i cut out the videos just after five days those the rosacea i think he was there or just those kind of symptoms anyway and they just vanished and after third day when i brought it back again they came up the second day it started itching and on the day two the red the red system just wasn't back right on that's great you and eating keto was it was it a meat based keto or what were you eating on keto because it's so no keto oily yes no i was eating plenty of meat but i've obviously plenty of veggies plenty of veggies you know all the keto veggies above ground you know with good healthy oils you know olive oils no bad oils no like i use like i like like i won't call them oils i don't know i and don't touch them at all so but lots of veggies and but and actually my symptoms first started arrived after i got tito back in i think they started out in 2014 then i've been keto for a year and i think that could have maybe began because of my of the intake of veggies actually so yes prior to that i didn't have any symptoms actually but i was eating a lot of flour and other stuff that weren't that healthy so yeah because keto helps certain things but you're right there's some substitutes and you actually eat a ton of vegetables um that yeah there could be all kinds of extra problems more problems yeah and at that time i wasn't aware of the toxins of the yeah yeah yeah that's found in veggies but today i know more so so when you i'm just i just want so when you drop the plants you know from keto yeah high plant yes even though there's there's animal foods no um when you drop the plants and went to carnivore um so what were the how quickly and what were the first things you noticed besides your skin which is amazing besides those issues all of the gassing that i have my stomach issues of course my skin felt much much better my nails my my hair started growing much much faster i felt and maybe slightly yeah i used to it feels like i used to have i still have some gray hair left but it doesn't feel like i have that much as i used to and it came rather early in when i was 25 i got my first gray hairs and now i'm 48 so but i'm rather pleased that's cool yeah that's great yeah so but uh yeah mostly you know stomach issues gas no you know no gassing at all when i went when i dish the veggies and of course my skin and and i i can also actually feel him the glow of my eyes it's slightly different but no one can tell that i just i can just tell it by myself that they feel more lush or more bright yeah clear clearer eyes well yeah how about your energy level or mood what's that uh the energy level is just off the roof uh always uh i'm 100 mental clear never have any dips that that's the best part and so many people are asking me why i give them two reasons because of the convenience and of the mental clarity that's the two biggest benefits of going carnivore you know uh do you have any did you have any um transition symptoms like some people have some kind of um bowel movement no no no no no not at all actually i i have had you know occasionally you know that i had to run on the toilets but never any that kind of as i heard jerome talk about you know those two weeks and mikayla not for me not a single time so i've just had you know occasional explosions but uh very very rare you know maybe once a year actually and i'm three years in now so yeah okay so you're so things are just improved and you just were you were used surprised how quick how how but yeah i i i was surprised because i wasn't expecting i was just going to give it a try and the focus the shawn's talking about and why i wanted to give a try i was just curious and i was thinking of you know the mental aspect of and of letting my stomach know just feel great and then suddenly you know those issues that i had in my face and with rosacea and stuff like that i've been to them into my family dog for five years tried out every imaginable prescription creams nothing worked and he couldn't even tell what it was and couldn't give me a diagnosis for it and he had some you know like put his finger up and where the wind was blowing he didn't have a clue and as soon as as soon as i left out the veggies the the symptoms just disappeared and since then i you know i've just seen so many people wanna dish the veggies if they doesn't matter what kind of skin condition they have it all heals up so fast and you know and the worst thing is psoriasis that i was hello brooke i see you still you're lying yeah you're seeing me okay your lights change yeah but let's see maybe it was my computer yeah i was just relaxing you know i want to ask you know no i'm like yeah you're back um i i just want to mention that anecdote you set up your grandfather because you know i know swedish culture i know sweden and there's all kinds of really wonderful little sayings they have little sayings about you know about practical saying about things so i'm just wondering if that's a if that's a swedish practical saying about you know if if there's no meat you know your health depends on meat on the table or something if that was like a saying was it what your grandfather said about i believe they always knew intuitive intuitively they knew what was best and they you know our grandmother always talked about you know healthy fats animal fats no always use butter never use you know these fake oils and i know when i was young i was trying to persuade my parents to use you know these healthy vegetable oils instead of the butter instead of the lard yeah and that's crazy and uh yeah yeah we've all been soaked yeah yeah and it's cold in sweden yeah it's getting vegetables growing all the time it's cold it's true yeah so and when you look at how the nature the season is changing and what you can grow and if you're not allowed to import things from around the world or you know we have a rather high big vegan community and the crazy thing is you know where they live in the north of the biggest community that we have they live up in northern sweden in a city called ilmio and they have a university and vegan cultures were rather rather big and it's crazy because you know they can't grow any veggies there and they're still opting for veggies so it's crazy that is crazy um so um i have to ask then so how did did your spouse then um come along after a while when she saw the change yeah she's holding improvements in my face and you know i'm you know almost 100 animal-based but when i'm invited over to dinner to people and you know i usually takes i usually take what is third i you know i take more meat but then i take maybe just slightly of something else just to make it look you know decent anyway and the day after i can feel the itching starting on my face and my wife sees that as well so she's accepted this accepted because she can see you know the issues that i have with my skin and how much better i'm feeling and i think you know she's getting more and more intolerant to certain images so in a few years time i don't know it could be that she would she would also that she will also trans transit to carnivore diet she won't admit that right now but if you ask me i think in 10 years time for sure well she's probably more meat be meat based in her keto diet no oh yeah for sure for sure yes yeah we're eating plenty plenty more meat and it might do children i always make you know on sundays i make burger patties like three kilos that's i think i think it's that's around five pounds and by thursday wednesday thursday they're all gone because when the kids come home from school they take a burger patty or two and you know just put some butter on and pull it down instead of eating something else very smart idea so what are you what's your typical diet now for you um yeah since i've been working at home uh my usual start is around noon uh five or six eggs and a pack of bacon and in the evening five six hundred grams of meat whatever you know usually uh beef or pork i love pork i actually prefer pork over beef but it depends on if i'm allowed to uh grill it and i i got myself a while um yeah oh yeah that's great so putting a great nice steak in the all the while that's that's the best but otherwise you know i like pork like pork really much and i think it's um i don't know i always been my family is with preferred pork and myanna she doesn't like beef at all so and even well i think you have i think you have really good pork in sweden yeah yeah i think that could be the reason why i like it and i prefer it actually um but i i don't yeah do you is it expensive to eat carnivore in sweden uh i don't know i guess our monthly bill is slightly higher than it was previously but not due to meat you know i don't eat three four times a day and the veggies they're rather important expensive because we can't grow them here we can grow kale during during the summer but then all of the other veggies salads and have to be important they're already yeah and you eat you have to eat it and bulk you know a big masses to get first so when you can you buy um can you buy beef uh from a ranch there yes i can and i prefer to do that actually and i have several good rangers you know small producers locally you know it takes me 10 minutes with the car or like 30 minutes with the bicycle i prefer to take my bicycle you know and get some exercise while i'm doing my shopping make shopping that's great yeah and and since you're swedish i know you drink coffee you drink coffee yeah i i drink plenty of coffee yeah and uh i drink with the cream in it so yeah and that's the only thing i've been you know trying to think of you know shall i let it go or not but i i i do think i'm rather addicted to coffee yeah and yeah i think i can drink at least 10 big jugs of coffee a day yes that's the swedish way i know yeah it is yeah and it's rather black we call american coffee is a rather pale version yeah yeah so you're fika you just you have hamburger patty with your car um yes um so do you take supplements no sometimes magnesium you know i do run a little bit and sometimes i get some cramps in my legs but i think it's more due to the running and i always sold plenty of but the only the only thing i take is magnesium sometimes and i actually did i did when i was yeah when i went to colorado last year i got myself a cac scan and uh because we can't get here in sweden and what i've been reading up i mean is supposed to be a good supplement if you want to try you can actually lower your score yeah yeah and i i i wasn't it wasn't that high i had like 120 was my score but i was hoping for it to be lower but you know okay i'm not that depressed which kind of magnesium do you take so many different um yeah uh i'm buying vinnie tortorius you know the nsng guy from here i mean there's like magnesium citrate there's magnesium yeah there's different there's different magnesium yeah i know i i i think he has two different strands of them in his uh in his capital but uh i haven't looked into it too much so you take some electrolytes you keep your salt up yeah running you still want and have you noticed the difference with your running with um carnivore oh yeah it has you know just running drinking water a little bit of salt and i did a 100 miler this summer on the hottest weekend of the of the year and i ended up on third third place so i managed to do 25 hours here so that was great oh that's great you did 100 miler so your recovery is good with carnivore yeah yeah no swelling in my joints i'm actually i'm two days after i ran again so and that's a huge difference if you compare to when i was a low carb even pre previous to that well does that 100 mile run are you taking are you um i know you're taking electrolytes but are you using gels are you taking anything you taking anything no no no no no else no i was taking a few berries just during while while i was running but that's the only thing just to get small taste that's fantastic yeah um good for you so yeah and that's the best part and you know just to be able to run and don't have to be dependent on and just letting your stomach rest and keeping energy in the foot and in the legs and in the head do you fast sometimes i yeah i the sometimes why i do it is because of the mental clarity we're actually no i like to do sometimes and mondays are usually a rather boring day at work so just keeping the lunch meal the breakfast meal lunch breakfast meal and eating after doing again so that's a natural 24 hour fast and a cold shower in the morning so that makes the day just a great day so instead of being the boring day of the week it actually turned out to be a rather good day of the week just by fasting and you know you know i'm just missing one meal so yeah but otherwise i've done a few 72 hours and it's a great feeling but you know i i don't i don't feel why i should do it and i'm still having plenty of time in between my meals so and i think if i'm hungry i'm eating once a day but usually twice a day lunch and evening dinner so very good you mentioned um well first before i ask that i i i want to ask you how long did it take you to do that 100 miles uh 25 hours so it's not compared to you know the real fast guys but um yeah slowing these up some breaks yeah so almost here but i've done 100 of my previously but that was in november in denmark and i didn't in 22 hours so yeah so that's nice very good time to go did they mention that they mentioned your diet when they were talking about the the uh the outcome of the of the race yeah but the lots of people that i was running along with and they they were you know they were just expecting when we were finished the race and i came up third and they came way way back and uh we spoke a few days later and all of them said we thought you know you he's never gonna make it because he's not taking any jails any you know energy because i was just drinking water you know and uh at the first pit stop but that was that like after i think it was after 30 40 they were serving hamburgers i just told them give me the patty and all of them were just looking at me and thought i was crazy and yeah so no it's a good feeling and a little i met many people along on the trail who was puking because they were eating too much you know ingesting gels stuff like that drinking all the time you know drink keep on drinking keep on drinking you know i know i don't you know if you're thirsty drink it first not otherwise so even if it was hot so yeah that's great that's like carnivores steady carnivores daddy that's awesome it is yeah that's awesome yeah you have kids you said so yeah children eat they're probably eat a lot of meat too they eat a lot of meat and they love meat as well and uh and always when he comes home from school they sometimes deserve a pure vegan or vegetarian meal he's always at this point so he always comes home he's hungry and we always have you know we have uh salamis in the in in freezer there's always burger patties so he can always have a slow mistake um you know just until the dinner gets there and so and they they for sure know that meat is belongs to to you know to make us thrive as as people as you know human beings and the youngest one actually he's just been into the is qualified to be in the national team boy 16 and that's soccer soccer is big heroes in europe uh that's great and yeah so yeah so he's joined that team so i always keep talking with him you know don't listen to those nutritionists who are working within the soccer or you know the average whatever sport because they're always talking about carbohydrates you know just trust me eat your meat eat your meat yeah your bacon eggs yeah that's all you need and he always says you know when i make him i usually five or six eggs and a pack of bacon more in money or whenever i eat and when he wants eggs and he usually has four eggs and a pack of bacon and always says dad that's so crazy when i eat bake bacon and eggs i'm never hungry until even dinner of course satiety yeah yeah how popular how popular do you think carnivores becoming in sweden is it no it's still very very we have a rather big community yes we don't think you know three four five thousand at least i think in the economy group there are like almost three thousand people but um it's getting some attention i've i don't know if you heard i'm organizing a conference here in sweden with europe yeah in malmo yeah yeah so i'm the organizer of that and uh so i've got a lot of attention in the media and you know people you know they regularly know what he's a crazy guy he's just leaving me but what are you calling that conference the meeting the meet yes yeah so yeah the meeting yeah and it's it's still being on the it's still being planned for covet or no code yeah i had i had to postpone it and uh i just hope yeah this coming august you know are gonna explode if they if the coronavirus is nothing around again so yeah yeah sorry is sean coming over to speak yeah yeah yeah sean is coming over to speak for sure yeah so amber's coming from the us and yeah and peter ballast from the us as well so right that's my three from america but i don't know uh it seems like you know we've been into low carb for a rather long time we used to have annika dolcryst here she was one of the forerunners for lchf or low carb and then we have diet doctor and but i think carnivore is much much more promising than the regular just keto yeah because it's more healing benefits yeah it's more species species specific appropriate yeah diet yeah yeah well you know i know that um hunting is a really important thing in sweden and let's get an even country so do you hunt or you you have friends or family i i i have a hunting license but i haven't because i took it when i was 18 and me and my friends did but i just bought myself a hunting dog in hungarian vishla last year so i'm training with him and he's like a dog where he's doing searches as well and but he's a really really great dog and i'm intending to go hunting with him as well and here in sweden we can only hunt with rifles uh we can't hunt with bow bow compound bows yet but they are planning on opening up for that as well so that that would be really really interesting and you have you could get you can buy reindeer and elk that's usually really available in sweden yeah yeah yeah we can yeah and i i have friends who are hunters as well so just usually no problem getting yeah yeah and wild boar and yeah when you yeah wild boar too yeah so when you get reindeer elk do you um do you mix it with suet with other fats yeah yeah i do yeah because it's a little bit lean yeah so you need to mix it up yeah so yeah that's very very common yeah that's great that you can get a range i used to get

        "transcript": "if you are somebody who is suffering from rosacea right now and you have been to numerous doctors who told you that rosacea is incurable and then the only thing you can do is to try avoiding triggers in order to manage your redness forget all about this what I want you to hear right now is that rosacea is possible to be cured and you can feel like yourself again and you can have your healthy and normal and happy life back I'm somebody who had rosacea for 10 years years of my life I had my rosacea since I was 18 Till I was 28 and now I'm 29 and I didn't have any rosacea flare up for a year already these are my before and afters and I know that my skin doesn't look like a perfect photoshopped super model skin at the moment but oh my God I couldn't be in a happier place right now with the way my skin looks at the moment my skin feels so healthy and glowy to me right now comparing to what it had been during the last 10 years and today I'm going to share with you what exactly I did in order to get this skin and I'm also going to share with you all of the things that they say are supposed to help you with rosacea but they didn't do anything for me let's go welcome back my friends if if you're new on this channel my name is Anna and here I talk about beauty style and everything that can make us love our life a little bit more and please support my channel by clicking the like button down below this really helps me grow my audience and grow my channel and create more videos like this one for you and subscribe if you haven't yet of course thank you so much let's get back to our topic of rosacea and before you start your rosacea Journey please make sure that what you have is actually rosacea any dermatologist will be able to diagnose it for you we can never know why we get rosacea and we can never find out the exact reasons why rosacea starts and I don't have anybody in my family who has ever had rosacea that's why nobody could really tell me what I have and how I can get better I was feeling really miserable during the last 5 years especially the way rosacea looked for me is that I was getting redness on my face it was focused on my cheeks in this area and on my chin uh during the last two years of my rosacea I also started having it on my nose and on my forehead in here and uh it was not only redness it was also pimples like breakouts that I would cut and those pimples they were so stubborn it it's not like a normal tiny pimple that you can just squeeze out and then it's going to be healed after 2 days that is something that if you try to squeeze it nothing will change about it it will stay so there is no point of trying to do anything to it and actually I had some pimples that stayed on my face for years like for a year at least that's for sure like it didn't go away it didn't get any smaller it didn't get any bigger nothing changed about it and I was just living with those things on my face and I know how Rosa can make you feel it can make you feel like you hate your skin and you hate yourself and that's what happened to me I got to the point where I was hating myself for not doing enough for not being strong enough to deal with this problem and I would hate the fact that I felt like I had to wear makeup to just leave my house I had to wear makeup all the time because when I was not wearing my makeup I felt like I looked like a monster and that I felt embarrassed of my bare skin and the only times when I would leave my house without any makeup was to go to see a new doctor and when I was going to see a new doctor I would go without makeup and I would want this doctor to see my bare skin I would want him to see how bad it is for me and how I'm suffering uffing and I thought that this could actually make him realize that I need help and the feeling of visiting a new doctor every time was so it was hard because every time you go to a new one you are full of hope you think maybe this time it's going to be it maybe this time it's going to be a person who's going to help me and I'm finally going to be cured but the disappoint man every time after it doesn't work it was tremendous and it was so painful when you when you go out there like I remember one time I was seeing this lady and I came to her office I showed her my skin I showed her pictures of how terrible my skin looks on some days and I was I was feeling so embarrassed of of myself of my skin and everything that she said to me is that Rosa is incurable you can you can't do anything about it you can try cantra but really nothing can be done so just goodbye that was that was the moment that I've had enough and I decided that I'm going to do more and that I'm going to finally take Serious steps and deal with it so I think I've had enough talking let's get actually to the things that they say are supposed to help you but they didn't help me at all and in the end I will say what helped me in fact among of the things that doctors say are supposed to help you with rosace is dieting and avoiding certain types of food and drinks and I've tried them all I've tried not drinking alcohol not drinking coffee caffeine not drinking coffee and alcohol at the same time not eating any red fruits or vegetables not eating anything red like ketchup as well and like tomato paste anything red it was a no no for me not eating gluten not eating sugar not eating diary products I had a phases when I had to avoid all of these products completely and all of these efforts brought me nothing with dieting out of the way we are moving to probiotics and vitamins I try taking probiotics vitamins different ones didn't do a thing for me next thing is uh skincare products for rosacea skincare products which are supposed to help with rosacea are not actually helping you cure rosacea what they can do is that they can help you kind of sooth and calm down your breakouts a little bit maybe dry them out a little bit but they never really helped me deal with my breakouts completely and what skincare uh products definitely don't do is that they don't prevent new breakouts from coming so new breakouts uh and new flare ups happen anyway doesn't matter what kind of uh like gentle skin care or expensive skincare products you use but uh bad skincare products can actually make you feel worse so really be careful with the skin care that you use if you have rosace I think I will do a separate video with skincare products that I used during my rosacea years and some of them I still use right now another thing that you supposed to avoid with rosacea is sun and heat and I used sunscreen every single day and it didn't improve my situation with rosacea at all another product which I'm sure you've heard of if you have been with Rosa for quite some time already is a magic cream called santra santra is a prescription uh cream which has an active ingredient which is called E vertine and usually doctors say that that is the only rosacea treatment that can actually help you and I had enormous hopes for this cream and they say You're supposed to use it for months before you start seeing results and I've used it every single day I've used it for 3 months for 6 months for 7 months and after 9 months I I understood that I'm not having any results with cantra zero results happened for me with cantra I also tried rosex rosex cream is another prescription cream which has an active ingredient called metronidazol and I've used it at the same time as cantra I used it for 6 months not for 9 months because uh I really felt bad about this cream it is really greasy it is heavy and I felt really really bad while using it I felt like my skin was getting greasy and I felt like my breakouts are even getting bigger and I felt like I was getting more breakouts with this cream so I really didn't like the rosex cream but I kept on using it for six months I used it every night and I used and I use cantra every morning and I didn't get any results with this cre creams also I have done numerous uh blood tests I was testing my health I was trying to find out what's wrong with me I also had a sio test sibo test is a kind of a Brea breathing test uh which is concerning your gut health you are supposed to be prepared for this test like you don't eat anything but chicken with olive oil and drinking water for 2 days which was super complicated and then you're breathing for 4 hours into a special tube and then you get your results uh the full name of this test is a small intestinal bacterial over growth test and well really lots of people don't get perfect perfect results from this test so after taking this test a doctor prescribed me xifaxan xifaxan is a local antibiotic for your gut health and I've been taking xifaxan for about a month and I have seen a little bit of result after taking Caan on my face and I was quite happy about it and I felt like I was on the right track but after stopping cakan everything came back my Rosia came back fully and that was the moment that that I understood that taking antibiotics might actually be a right direction for me and I've researched the topic a lot and what I've read is that in the USA and in Europe there is um medication that is helping with rosacea and it is called orasa or eesh IA here in Europe they have different names in Europe and in the United States I managed to find a doctor who agreed with me that it's a good idea for me to take the direction of taking antibiotics EPA the way it is called here in Europe has an active ingredient of doxy it has 40 milligrams of doxy doxy is quite a strong antibiotic but 40 milligrams is not that much and what you are supposed to do is that you take eia for 3 months every single day and while this might sound scary for you antibiotics for 3 months I would say it was 100% worth it for me and I was so happy that I decided to take it the way you are supposed to take acia is you take it in the morning on an empty stomach and then you wait for 1 hour before you have breakfast that was a good schedule for me I was happy to have an 1 hour of free time before breakfast and I didn't experience any side effects with ephestia at all I felt fine the whole time my God Health was fine the whole time I was taking prebiotics and probiotics during taking aphria and after taking EPA for some time and generally I didn't experience anything bad about this about this about epia and I started seeing the results after one month and a half I started seeing that my breakouts started going away and after finishing acia I had uh like I think like two pimples on my face which was close to nothing I was beyond happy and two months after starting after stopping ecia I had zero break breakouts my face was completely clear and I read a lot online that people often get their Rosa back after stopping EPA or orasa but that didn't happen to me I didn't get any rosacea flare ups or any rosacea breakouts during the last year after I stopped aesia my skin I as I've already said is is far from perfect but I'm so happy with the way it is and I try to stick to a healthy diet I try to eat as many vegetables and fruits as possible although I know I'm far from perfect I eat meat and fish and I drink coffee each day and uh I drink alcohol really rarely but sometimes I do in small quantities I eat sugar and I eat gluten and I eat diary products and that doesn't make my skin feel any worse sometimes I know when I'm eating like a big birthday cake full of cream I know that I might get a tiny pimple the next day but that pimple does not look like the rosacea breakouts that I used to have it looks like you know a tiny little pimple that goes away after one day or two days so that that doesn't resemble rosacea breakouts at all after about 3 months after stopping etia I had three sessions of lumenis M22 treatment it is an IPL therapy intense pulse light therapy they also call it a photofacial and this treatment is supposed to improve your skin color and skin texture and that was exactly what I needed after 10 years of rosacea my skin was a little bit treed in some places the texture was not perfect I had enlarged pores and three sessions of IPL helped me really a lot I don't feel like I need to do any other sessions I don't feel like I need to do anything else to my skin I'm just going to continue with the skincare routine that I have right now and I couldn't be in a happier place than I am right now I really hope that this video was helpful for you please click the

that that is possible thank you so much for watching and I will see you soon bye",

        "transcript": "today i'm going to share with you my rosacea story i'm going to tell you about the six stages i went through to totally eradicate my symptoms and if it worked for me then it could work for you too so keep watching because what have you got to lose except perhaps your rosacea [Music] doctors will tell you the cause of rosacea is unknown and that there's no cure they'll also tell you that your only option is to treat your symptoms with medications probably for the rest of your life and they'll also warn you the condition might worsen with age well i'm here to tell you that your doctor's rosacea diagnosis is no medical doctor ever cured rosacea the best they can hope for is to temporarily master symptoms using pharmaceuticals and in some persons these medical interventions can even worsen the condition over time but i'm going to take you down a very different path my journey with rosacea forced me to address all the potential causes of the condition and then to rectify those issues in a logical systematic manner first we need to jump back 15 years to a rather dark period in my life from rosetta first to hold now i'm sure that those of you who suffer from this adult skin condition will understand exactly what i'm about to say next because to put it bluntly rosacea truly is a curse it literally appears out of the blue generally taking hold within a very short period of time and it can absolutely dominate your life destroying your self-confidence in the process nowadays however i'm 100 rosacea free and i never suffer relapses to achieve this i made only a few simple changes in my life nothing difficult nothing expensive anyone can do it and i guarantee that anybody who follows my example will experience positive results so here's my story detailing exactly what i did to permanently eradicate my rosacea back in 2007 when i first noticed my initial rosacea symptoms i just assumed it was mild acne now that in itself was a little confusing because i hadn't had acne since i was a teenager and i was now 47 so i tried using various medicated face wash products and sport creams but they just seem to make things worse causing more redness and drying on my skin so at this point all i'm thinking is what the hell is this on my face and to make things worse at the time i was working as an anti-aging consultant being paid to give health advice to my clients so you can imagine how that must have looked would you take health advice from somebody with a red spotty complexion probably not and we would blame you so i stopped all acne treatments there and then and decided to focus my efforts on identifying the condition and hopefully getting the appropriate treatment well of course it didn't take long to figure out that rosacea was the most likely candidate so i thought great now i know what it is i'll simply get an appointment with my doctor and i'll have my lovely clear skin back in no time but oh how soon that feeling of confidence gets dashed i wonder how many of us have heard that we're following words uttered by our doctor or dermatologist there is no cure you're just going to have to live with it we have medications and creams that can help with your symptoms but you may need to use them for the rest of your life now i don't know about you but my first reaction was to hell with that scenario long-term antibiotics together with the regular use of chemical face creams these are not components that contribute to good health quite the opposite i thought but then reality sinks in and it dawns on you that perhaps you have no option because anything's better than walking around with this red spotty face right at this point in the diagnosis i was experiencing those unavoidable feelings of despair that hit you when you feel so utterly helpless so yes initially i followed the advice of the so-called skin specialist to the letter i took my daily antibiotics and i tried a selection of medicated rosacea face creams and the end result of six months on these meds little to no visible improvement the only thing that appeared to have any positive effect was azelaic acid cream but if i had to put a number on it then i'd say a 10 improvement in most and that dreams things like hell so ultimately all these useless meds were tossed in the bin there had to be a better solution and i was damn well going to find it so here's what i did first i put my work and social life on hold nothing was going to distract me from my goal of once again having clear skin now research was an integral part of my work in life extension so the process of finding and analyzing relevant data was second nature to me i trawl endlessly through research data documenting my findings as i went however it quickly became apparent that something vital was missing from these studies not a single one took a holistic approach to dealing with rosacea it was more a case of let's see what effect therapy a has compared to therapy b compared to placebo so irrespective of whether a study was blind double blind or whatever they were all pretty much focused on finding some magic bullet that would cure the condition that in my opinion is absolutely the wrong approach it certainly hasn't been successful so far so logic dictated that an entirely different way of treating the condition was necessary i deduced if i was going to have any chance of eradicating my rosacea then i was going to have to attack it holistically i decided to focus all my efforts in optimizing my immune system and overall health by systematically addressing every possible factor that might in some way be compromising it and worsening my symptoms now up until this point i consider myself to be extremely healthy and i assumed therefore that my immune function must be close to optimal well time to rethink that one i thought if my immune system was in such good shape then why had i been afflicted with rosacea something had to be amiss and i was going to find it and fix it whatever it took rosacea causes depression there can be no argument about that just ask anyone who's ever suffered from the condition the big problem with this though is that depression suppresses immune function therefore if i was to have any real chance of success it was paramount now i focus on being positive and upbeat this really is key so here's the mindset and attitude that i employed first i accepted that every medical condition has a cause therefore every medical condition must be treatable sure we may not always know what the cause is or the appropriate treatment but simply the fact that we both must exist was all the motivation i needed to see this thing through following a full analysis of my research data i decided that my rosacea treatment protocol was to include six separate interventions and i would only proceed to add the next intervention one science sufficient time to evaluate the results of the previous one that way i'd know exactly which treatment responsible for which benefits firstly i stopped using all skin cleansing products except for a liquid soap antenna for babies it contained no chemicals caused me zero skin irritation and it didn't dry out my skin it's actually still my product of choice to this day and for anyone that might want to try it i've left a link in the description below using only this one cleansing product resulted in a noticeable reduction in redness if i ever felt like my skin needed hydrating then i'd simply apply organic aloe vera gel which proved to be very cooling and caused me no irritation next i stopped all sun exposure now i have to admit this was a hard one for me water sports on the beach had always been an important part of my life but for now at least they were gonna have to be put on hold because anything longer than a couple of minutes in the sun was causing increased facial redness but i should mention that i did take a vitamin d3 supplement in order to compensate for the lack of sun exposure following that i was next forced to address my regular sauna use i'd always been a big fan of the sauna due to its many proven health benefits but i now find myself suffering increased facial redness for several hours following each session so the only option was to knock on the head for now but a little spoiler alert i'm very happy to tell you nowadays i can use a sauna without problems and i can even enjoy sensible sun exposure without skin issues of any kind but more on that later i'd estimate that the overall benefit of these three simple changes was around a 20 improvement although i'd attribute this mainly to less frequent flare-ups as opposed to any major reductions in the symptoms themselves obtaining quality sleep each and every night is quite simply an integral part of achieving optimal health however it's probably the most common factor that most people could improve on and i was no exception before rosacea struck my bedtime would vary between 11 pm to 2 a.m depending on my work schedule or my social plans but i'd always awaken by alarm clock each morning at 7 00 am now i knew from experience that a minimum of seven hours sleep and a maximum of eight seem to provide me with optimal energy levels and mental function throughout the day so here's what i did i immediately set a fixed bedtime of 11 pm but allowed myself to awaken naturally between 6 and 7 am each morning that way i was always sleeping for just as long as my body required sleep quality is without doubt one of the strongest factors influencing both our immune system health and our mental function so i saw this approach as vital it took me less than a week to properly adapt to my new sleep schedule and within the first month i was already feeling and seeing the benefits energy levels had increased and my positive attitude was boosted by a further reduction in symptoms if i had to put a number on it then i'd say another 10 improvement let me also mention that in order to benefit my sleep patterns i use the popular supplement melatonin and for a full explanation regarding how to properly use this supplement and how to optimize your sleep quality then please see my melatonin video elsewhere on this channel next it was time to deal with those nasty little demodex mites now for anyone who hasn't heard of them demodex mites also known as face mites are parasites that live in our face and hair follicles there's two types of dermadex mite and they're both invisible to the naked eye demidex brevis live on the skin and demodex follicularum on hair but here's where i got a shock a little bit of research confirmed that people with rosacea could have up to ten times as many demodex mice on their skin as those without the condition i also learned that the mites become most active in the dark and that they have several stages in their life cycle after meeting on the surface of the skin they apparently go back into it to lay eggs before dying within the skin's layers after death the demidex corpses become liquid and decompose inside the skin when each of these tiny mice dies they release bacteria into the skin and those bacteria trigger an immune response that causes redness and inflammation now one bacteria in particular carried by deminex has been shown to stimulate an immune response in those with rosacea so it seemed pretty obvious to me that deminex must surely be contributing to my symptoms thankfully getting rid of my demonics problem was fairly straightforward a quick search on google revealed that pretty much anyone who's heard of a demodex mite also knows that tea tree oil kills them effectively so i got straight to it i mixed tea tree oil with emu oil in a 50 50 mix for application to my eyebrows and eyelashes and for application to my face and scalp i used a 30 tea tree 70 emu oil mix this ratio caused me no skin sensitivity issues whatsoever now the reason why i chose emu oil as a carrier off for tea tree is because it's non-comedogenic so won't cause clogged pores it's also highly hypoallergenic possesses anti-inflammatory properties and can penetrate deep through the skin's layers allowing it to effectively target demodex brevis every night before bed for seven days straight i applied the appropriate mix of oil to my face scalp eyebrows and eyelashes then in the morning i just showered and washed it off i experienced visible improvements and by the end of the seven day treatment my skin looked noticeably smoother and clearer following that i added five percent tea tree oil to my liquid soap for daily use now this protocol resulted in a further 20 percent improvement in my rosacea symptoms i was definitely making good progress now with a 50 overall improvement so far reports of certain foods causing rosacea flare-ups are commonplace and a quick search on google will provide a list of the most commonly reported problematic foods now at the time i wasn't really aware of consuming anything in particular that exacerbated my own rosacea other than perhaps alcohol which i'd already cut out however i still decided to try as an experiment i selected one food group at a time and totally eliminated that food from my diet for a period of four weeks in order to gauge any improvements but nothing appeared to make any noticeable difference not until this happened i eliminated dairy within three weeks the difference was significant after two months of being dairy free i could finally see light at the end of the tunnel i'd estimate that i was now 80 free of all rosacea symptoms three months into my dairy free experiment i decided to try reintroducing cheese to see what might happen within only a few days mild symptoms were returning which only served to confirm the effect that dairy was having on my condition my dietary strategy of needing to cure rosacea was based on optimizing my nutritional intake in a way that would also optimize my gut microbiome as we now know our microbiome is often referred to as our second brain influencing everything from our thoughts to our immune system health so in addition to carrying out the food group elimination tests i also made sure to avoid all processed foods primarily selecting whole foods in as close to the original form as possible now during this past decade my diet has been leaning towards vegan but i do occasionally still eat meat fish and eggs especially eating out if i were looking to put a label in my dietary practices then i'd probably classify myself as a nutritarian eating to satisfy nutrient requirements above all else nutritional supplements had always been an important part of my personal health program and i always considered a high quality daily multivitamin to be a necessity in order to cover any dietary deficiencies however i was now being forced to look at supplements from a slightly different perspective which supplements in particular would most benefit the appearance of my skin two supplements stood out the first supplement i chose was a peripheral antioxidant called astaxanthin it's a darkly pigmented substance which is produced by a particular type of microbe microalgae and it's the reason why salmon weeds are pink astaxanthin's powerful anti-inflammatory effects can also help calm the inflammation in rosacea and it's been shown to provide a useful degree of uv protection with its natural carotenoid pigments even adding a healthy color to the skin several studies have also shown beneficial effects in relation to wrinkles and skin moisture levels now i noticed the benefits of taking the supplement within a very short period of time and it continues to take it to this day one daily four milligram capsule is all is required and if you'd like to know more about this amazing supplement then you can watch my detailed astaxanthin video elsewhere on this channel the second supplement i chose to take was iodine and here was my reasoning i learned that iodine deficiency in the developed world had increased considerably over the last 40 years and i also noted the apparent steady increase in the rate of rosacea during the same period with the condition now afflicting over 400 million adults worldwide now i knew that iodine was highly important for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland which in turn has a direct influence over the appearance of our skin but what i hadn't been aware of are two reasons why i might be iodine deficient firstly i simply might not be getting enough iodine from my diet and secondly what i was ingesting might be getting blocked by three other elements from the same mineral family those being fluoride bromide and chlorine fluoride is often added to the water supply and it's also a common additive for most toothpaste products bromide is present in pesticides it's often used as a food additive in flower and you can even find it lurking in many personal care products and chlorine well it's present in drinking water swimming pools and jacuzzis now the big problem is this chlorine bromide and fluoride all compete for the same receptors that are used in the thyroid gland to capture iodine ultimately this can inhibit thyroid hormone production with the resultant low thyroid state but here's where it gets really interesting there's actually several other tissues that absorb and utilize iodine and these tissues include the skin so if i did have an iodine deficiency it certainly wasn't going to be benefiting my rosacea condition my solution was to immediately begin supplementing with six milligrams of iodine daily which research indicated was sufficient to ensure that my thyroid and affected tissues had the necessary levels available to function correctly i also made efforts to eliminate exposure to fluoride bromide and chlorine one month into my skin supplement protocol and my condition had continued to improve i'd estimate i was now 90 rosacea free and to be honest if the texture of my skin had just been a little bit better then i've considered myself to have returned to as my pre-rosacea state however i did have one last stage to go and this final stage turned out to be exactly what i needed in order to achieve my goal the final part of my six days protocol was to eliminate any chemical toxins stored within my fat cells we're all exposed to these toxins on a daily basis through the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat even the personal care products we put on our hair and skin the problem is that over time excesses of these toxins can accumulate in our fat cells and they can include such things as endocrine disruptors carcinogens even skin irritants so i figured that irrespective of whether or not they might be affecting my rosacea condition getting rid of them could only be a good thing my research indicated that the one and only truly effective protocol for eliminating chemical toxins stored within human fat cells was a detox developed by dr george ew this protocol was used by rescue workers suffering from toxic chemical inhalation following in 9 11 attacks and it proved to be highly effective shortly after dr you tweaked the protocol for use by the general adult population and is now extremely popular with anti-aging and life extension enthusiasts now initially i was a bit apprehensive about trying this detox because it does require the use of the sauna and the last thing i wanted to experience at this point was a setback however i needn't have worried it now appeared at the extreme heat of the sauna was no longer having any negative effect whatsoever on my rosacea condition quite the opposite in fact with every sauna detox session my skin was becoming closer to 100 percent clear now i'm not going to spend time here describing doctor use detox rather i'll direct you to a detailed video i made in the subject elsewhere on this channel but what i will tell you right now is this the results of this detox with regard to your overall health and the appearance of your skin can be truly transformational to this day i still repeat doctor use sonnet detox once a month in order to prevent any further toxin build up and i still take regular saunas several times a week so that was my sixth stage rosacea protocol in a nutshell to the best of my knowledge those who have tried it have all had worthwhile results and some have even experienced a complete and permanent reversal of their symptoms fast forward to 2022 i'm still 100 rosacea free and have been for the past 12 years it appears that my skin together with those underlying factors that were causing my rosacea have now fully reverted to their pre-rosacea state but the most remarkable change for me is that sunshine saunas alcohol stress even berry appear to no longer pose any threat to my clear skin however i would point out that for health reasons i choose to rarely consume dairy or alcohol the bottom line is this if you want to effectively deal with your rosacea condition then it really does require a totally holistic approach in reality this applies not only to rosacea but to our health in general perhaps if our doctors were better educated in these facts then they wouldn't be so hasty in prescribing medications because there's generally far more effective routes to achieving good health than popping pills i really do wish you the very best of luck in dealing with your rosacea condition and i'd love to hear your comments regarding your progress in dealing with this dramatic affliction the sharing of such information can only serve to benefit us all i'm wrecker black many thanks for watching and if you enjoyed this presentation then please like subscribe and comment it really does help the channel grow

        "transcript": "okay so this topic has been coming up a lot I've taken on some nutrition only weight loss clients over the past year just friends and family members who have gotten the word out that kind of the skin health process the three phases that I do with people also leads to pretty fast weight loss so I've been getting hit up a lot by people looking to lose some weight lower their body fat and a question that's been a theme for the past two months is cheat meals and people want to know two things do cheat meals negatively affect your results for lowering your body fat and body composition weight loss and does eating cheat meals or having a schedule cheat mill mess up the process of healing eczema dermatitis psoriasis and rosacea leaky gut things like that can you heal your skin and have some cheat meals and can you be successful losing weight and have some cheat meals that's the question I'm going to cover that in today's video stay tuned [Music] okay so first off let me cover the subject up did I ever eat sheet Mills during my recovery process from eczema dermatitis and psoriasis and straight-up I did not ever cheat once of course some bad nutrients slipped into my food some ingredients that I didn't know about during that year sometimes I had to compromise my macros slightly but I never ate a cheap meal I think that if your focus is disease reversal especially if it's gut related which all disease is then having cheap Mills needs to be something that you just do not do now eating meals that are very delicious and it tastes really good should be part of your normal diet now everyone's got to go through the whole phases during cleanses and detoxification processes where they're really focused on their minimal diet and of course it's not going to taste amazing but on a regular basis you should be looking forward to eating food that tastes really good to you and parts of your normal diet your staple foods should taste really super good if not adjust your recipes maybe you're being too precise or maybe you're just not adding in things that taste good but as far as having cheat meals during the healing process for me it was an absolute no-no I knew that for me I'm an addictive personality when it comes to food and I knew that if I had that one Big Mac or that one doughnut that it was gonna lead to another one and another one and it would it would always lead to two things one I knew that it would mess up my digestion and it would send me in a place of feeling really frustrated like the work that I had already done to heal my skin was was negated and didn't count and it was just a waste of time so it depressed me for that and then also it was something that literally I could feel the digestion alysha's and I knew I mean how can I heal my skin if my gut health is like really crappy soap and stead of cheating what I did is I just learned some staple foods that tasted really really good and anytime I was having a craving I used whole foods to create the closest flavor I could to that craving and just ate as much of that food it was a bunch of the nutrients that tasted and sounded good to me as I wanted and and really filled my body up with good nutrients and you know made my way through the craving but it was really important to me during my healing process to never cheat and what I've noticed with my skin disease clients is that the ones that do have occasional cheat meals some wine some coffee you know a cheeseburger here and there tend to have a really challenging time healing their skin completely also the ones that I'm working with who are around weight loss most of my weight loss clients there's a psychological component to the weight loss definitely and part of the behavioral psychological component resides on changing your behaviors so if every time you get into a new diet plan and things start to go good and you your whole week is focused on having that pleasurable mouth pleasurable mouth orgasm meal that takes up a lot of energy that takes up a lot of psychology and that's not why would you want to be focusing on one single meal in your life it's so boring obsessed about what you're eating for a little while so that it becomes a habit so you don't have the need for cheat meals how much do cheat meals set you back they set you back immensely psychologically they set you back gut health-wise they set you back calories wise they set you back nutrient wise they set you back and I also think that the idea behind cheat meals is to give yourself a reward or to give yourself something that tastes really really good so that you're enjoying your food and I do think that there is a component to eating a holistically healthy diet of Whole Foods when you're being successful that it does taste good the reason I don't need cheat meals now and I don't eat them and the reason why I didn't use cheat Mills during my cleansing process of my detoxification process in my healing process was because I figured out ways to make the whole foods that I was eating taste so good then I just really didn't have a need for those cheap Mills okay so I wanted to expand after shooting that little clip I was driving to breakfast and I want to expand upon two little points and they have to do with not cheating but allowing yourself to have the flavors that you really desire whether it's sweet or savory you can make it happen as a vegan one of the examples I always use was either I would crave burgers or pizza and as a vegan that was really simple I could do a cornmeal base or a cauliflower base crust load up with veggies load up a pineapple up with mushrooms a little vegan cheese tomato sauce and boom craving for a pizza with no gluten with no horrible things for me and it tasted like a cheap mill but it wasn't nowadays as kind of a keto Voris primal traditional dieter i crave sweets once in a while how do I make that happen I love to create creamy sweet jell-o's from gelatin sweetened with stevia so is that the cleanest most perfect food in the history of the world nutrition wise yeah it's pretty good it digests easy and it keeps me from eating cheesecake or red velvet cake or some other sweet and gnarly thing that's really gonna mess my digestion and skin up so there's two examples of what you can do instead of cheating you can have all the mouth pleasure you want and have no negative side effects for a lot of you guys in the early phases of your recovery process that's the main issue is the food doesn't taste very good yet so you've got to use different methods to create recipes and different food combinations I was very minimal I stuck to the stuff that I liked and I didn't branch out too much I think that in the beginning you gotta either white-knuckle it or you gotta experiment a lot to see what what flavors and what palates work best for you so you don't get bored and so that you can continue to stay consistent and and stay on path if you are someone who and this is the only really caveat so basically if you're trying to reverse disease don't do cheat Mills just figure out ways if you're having the desire to cheat to make healthy food taste really good so just use a different ritual to overcome that behavior is the best way to do that if you are looking to lower your body fat and you're looking for weight loss the bottom line is that if you're eating a majority of your foods or whole foods and you're keeping your calories at maintenance or below and you're moving your body a cheat meal once in a while won't really slow that process down the problem problem is for most of you guys like I said is if it triggers a psychological thing that makes you crave food that makes your eating healthy food even harder than skip it don't make things harder for yourself then you really need to do and the same applies for you guys take that craving for whatever it is and apply it to healthy Whole Foods so you get that flavor in your mouth you get the mouthfeel and the texture it tastes delicious but at the same time you don't have that negative feeling like you cheated it like you did something wrong and it generally will have about one fifth of the calories you know you take a you know like a flax paste muffin of blueberry flex-based muffin with a little coconut sugar in it compared to like a blueberry muffin you get at a bakery that flax muffin tastes delicious compared to that blueberry muffin that it's satisfying maybe the blueberry muffin is a little sweeter a little better but it's not that big of a difference it will still take away the craving the calories in that flax muffin are probably 1/5 and the nutrients in that flax muffin are so good that it won't lead to your body desiring more and more and more looking for the nutrients but only getting empty calories so use a smart approach understand your own personal psychology and understand maybe you can get away with the cheat here and there or in my approach that I use with my clients and the approach they use with myself and this this comes from my old days I'm a I'm a nerd from the hey old school behavioral science that's what I have a degree in behavioral science and masters in psych and yoga therapy certification in the highest level so it's all about behavior change when you're talking about reversing dis skin disease or trying to overcome any any type of health issue okay so you're either gonna want to use the approach of just cut out the idea of cheat meals all together just get your discipline on struggle through it for a while but then get get used to it and get really good at just eating clean all the time option two this is the option I love to use my clients and myself if I'm hungry for something it might be my body telling me at once or need something I'm gonna listen to my body I'm gonna give it the flavors and textures that it really wants but I'm gonna use all Whole Foods so let's say I'm craving a pizza which I never do I could use gluten-free cornmeal crust I get loaded with vegetables and grass-fed beef I could leave the dairy off the craving is busted my diet wasn't cheated on that's just a random lame example but you can use healthy foods to bust your craving and to keep you on track and you get the best of both worlds you get all that delicious flavor and you stay on track with your disease reversal goals or your you know fat loss body fat goals I think that's the best choice or number three some of you guys will be able to do this for those of you guys who are dedicated to skin disease reversal this will not be you but if you're someone who's focused on weight loss and you're like look I can eat a cheat meal once in a while it does not trigger me to have more cheap mills it doesn't make me obsess about food I can just eat it and then go back to eating my my normal outline diet then cool enjoy a cheat meal once in a while that's not me that's not most people for most of you guys watching this video you're gonna have more success with the second option or the first option just use healthy foods to bust your cravings or just skip cheat meals altogether I will tell you this at the end of the day when you wake up in the morning and your skin is clear or you look in the mirror and you're your body's lean and healthy and you've lost that weight and you've gotten gone your health and your body and and everything is where you want it to be that is such an empowering feeling it's such a better feeling it's it's a it's a complete feeling it feels wonderful it feels full of energy and strength and power it's so much better than the five seconds that it feels good eating that cinnamon roll and I urge you to go for the goose bumps in life go for that sustainable 24/7 amazing filling rather than sticking some random food in your mouth that's gonna taste really good and then lead to all sorts of issues down the road that's gonna do

dive into this video i really really hope it\u00a0\nhelps you out because rosacea sucks all right so a\u00a0\u00a0 little background about me and rosacea and all of\u00a0\nthat i was like i said it was probably about like\u00a0\u00a0 six or seven years ago now that i noticed my skin\u00a0\nwas just really becoming like red and inflamed i\u00a0\u00a0 was getting all these little like red bumps and\u00a0\ni went to the dermatologist and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 was like yeah you have rosacea and i just remember\u00a0\nthem telling me that and i was like oh my gosh\u00a0\u00a0 like i've you know seen people with rosacea i've\u00a0\nheard all about it and i never thought it would\u00a0\u00a0 you know hit me and hit my skin but i was starting\u00a0\nto see all these things and i just remember being\u00a0\u00a0 like oh my gosh like no this cannot be happening\u00a0\nand i went to a couple different dermatologists\u00a0\u00a0 this was all the way back when i was in atlanta um\u00a0\nand they also the same thing they're like yes it's\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea there's nothing you can do about it it's\u00a0\nincurable you just have to manage it and they all\u00a0\u00a0 wanted to throw like medication and antibiotics\u00a0\nat me and at the time like i said i honestly had\u00a0\u00a0 no idea what to do so i started taking antibiotics\u00a0\nand yeah i mean it controlled it to somewhat and\u00a0\u00a0 it helped it clear my skin somewhat but you can't\u00a0\nstay on antibiotics long and i'm going to even\u00a0\u00a0 share with you why it's the worst idea to take\u00a0\nantibiotics if you have rosacea i'm going to share\u00a0\u00a0 that with you shortly but to make a long story\u00a0\nshort when you go to a dermatologist that's all\u00a0\u00a0 they want to do is they want to throw prescription\u00a0\nmedications at you prescription topical products\u00a0\u00a0 at you and prescription you know like antibiotics\u00a0\nand internal prescriptions which that so as i\u00a0\u00a0 continued on and you know my whole little journey\u00a0\nwith this i was just like no like something\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't doesn't seem right there's no way this is\u00a0\nyou know incurable you know i had dermatologists\u00a0\u00a0 tell me that it was like mites on my skin and just\u00a0\nlike dermatologists don't even know why people get\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea like i i went to so many different doctors\u00a0\nand they all said the same thing they're like yeah\u00a0\u00a0 we don't really know what causes rosacea but we do\u00a0\nknow that it's a skin condition that you just have\u00a0\u00a0 to live with and it's you there's no cure and\u00a0\ni was like no like i'm not gonna deal with this\u00a0\u00a0 like i'm not gonna be on medications for the rest\u00a0\nof my life for skin issues like no like there's\u00a0\u00a0 got to be something to this so i really really\u00a0\nstarted researching and i remember laying in bed\u00a0\u00a0 at all hours of the night and just researching\u00a0\nresearching what other people have done and\u00a0\u00a0 researching um just everything that i could figure\u00a0\nout about this skin condition which actually led\u00a0\u00a0 me to osmosis and this was like i said like six or\u00a0\nseven years ago osmosis was like a tiny company no\u00a0\u00a0 one heard of osmosis i reached out to the company\u00a0\nbecause i read a lot of good things about them\u00a0\u00a0 on just like little blogs here and there and i\u00a0\nread like little like rosacea blogs and people\u00a0\u00a0 were saying how it really you know this brand was\u00a0\nlike the one brand that really helped their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and they were like these tiny little blogs that i\u00a0\nhad to like dig through so much research to find\u00a0\u00a0 because i said i've never heard of osmosis no\u00a0\none did back then so i reached out to osmosis\u00a0\u00a0 and become became started to become you know\u00a0\nfriends with ben johnson ben johnson he's been\u00a0\u00a0 on my channel now for years he's a really good\u00a0\nfriend of mine now but i reached out to him and i\u00a0\u00a0 remember having conversations with him about like\u00a0\nmy skin in particular and all kinds of stuff again\u00a0\u00a0 long story short ben johnson the formulator of\u00a0\nosmosis skincare is very holistic and he's the one\u00a0\u00a0 that put into my mind he's like no brianna like\u00a0\nyou're going about things the wrong way rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is internal it's like an internal issue that you\u00a0\nhave to fix from the inside out and everything\u00a0\u00a0 clicked everything he said made so much sense\u00a0\nso i started taking his advice and everything\u00a0\u00a0 in my life just completely turned around what i\u00a0\nlearned is that rosacea is an internal imbalance\u00a0\u00a0 it's gut health it is all about gut health and\u00a0\ninflammation in your gut and all of that and\u00a0\u00a0 once you have that figured out you can clear your\u00a0\nskin and that is not even just with rosacea it is\u00a0\u00a0 with acne it's with so many other skin conditions\u00a0\nmy son is 14 and was getting really bad acne we\u00a0\u00a0 completely changed around his diet put him on the\u00a0\nright supplements and he has really clear skin now\u00a0\u00a0 you can clear a skin condition including rosacea\u00a0\nit is not an incurable skin condition you can cure\u00a0\u00a0 it with internal balance so basically what's going\u00a0\non is you know you don't just wake up with rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 one morning it's an ongoing thing that's happening\u00a0\nin your body and the funny thing is i've always\u00a0\u00a0 had like like gut issues and digestion issues and\u00a0\nall of that bloating i would get like really bad\u00a0\u00a0 stomach aches sometimes and you know we're so busy\u00a0\nin our daily lives you don't even like really stop\u00a0\u00a0 to listen to your body your body is always telling\u00a0\nyou something and your skin is a representation\u00a0\u00a0 of what's going on in your body your skin is\u00a0\na representation of the health that's going\u00a0\u00a0 on inside your body and once you really begin\u00a0\nto learn that and begin to listen to your body\u00a0\u00a0 it all makes sense so rosacea stems from your gut\u00a0\nand like i said it's not something you just wake\u00a0\u00a0 up with one day and you're like oh crap like\u00a0\ni have rosacea now it doesn't happen like that\u00a0\u00a0 it's something that you know takes a while to\u00a0\nreally start to come out in your skin it's you\u00a0\u00a0 know all these little digestion issues it's your\u00a0\ngut health it's like you know food intolerances\u00a0\u00a0 are a big thing i actually took myself off dairy\u00a0\nand gluten to begin my whole journey with and that\u00a0\u00a0 helped a lot because i did find out i had um\u00a0\nintolerances to both gluten and dairy i'll get\u00a0\u00a0 into all that as well but once you really start\u00a0\nto realize that rosacea stems from the inside\u00a0\u00a0 and it's the inflammation it's the toxins that are\u00a0\nbuilding up within your gut and your digestion and\u00a0\u00a0 you know all of that once you figure that\u00a0\nout you can clear your skin and that is so\u00a0\u00a0 key so let's talk about the three steps that you\u00a0\nneed to take to cure your rosacea like cure your\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea for good step number one is diet now i\u00a0\npersonally went to a functional medicine doctor\u00a0\u00a0 um there was a place in atlanta that i went to\u00a0\na functional medicine like a holistic doctor\u00a0\u00a0 and it completely changed my life like i got\u00a0\nlike blood work done i got all of these you\u00a0\u00a0 know food intolerances done but what i really\u00a0\nlearned and it's the exact same thing that i\u00a0\u00a0 learned from talking to dr ben johnson is that\u00a0\nyour body can heal itself like i said everything\u00a0\u00a0 that's like going on in your body it will come\u00a0\nout on your skin if you have toxins building up\u00a0\u00a0 if you have inflammation it's going to come out\u00a0\non your skin and honestly going to a functional\u00a0\u00a0 medicine doctor is just so like eye opening and\u00a0\ni love it like i still go to a functional doctor\u00a0\u00a0 today just to keep up with like my blood work and\u00a0\njust to see how things are going you know like\u00a0\u00a0 i go to a normal like physicals you know i go to\u00a0\nmy normal women's physical doctors and stuff but i\u00a0\u00a0 always go to my functional medicine doctor for\u00a0\nlike the blood work and they just dive into so\u00a0\u00a0 much and they just have such a different approach\u00a0\nto healing the body in a different approach to to\u00a0\u00a0 medicine because i think i think we as like humans\u00a0\nwe are bombarded with like prescriptions upon\u00a0\u00a0 prescriptions upon prescriptions when our bodies\u00a0\nare meant to heal themselves and our bodies are\u00a0\u00a0 showing signs of distress all the time but we just\u00a0\nhave to take the time to listen to what they are\u00a0\u00a0 and rosacea acne it's a sign that something is off\u00a0\nin your body and you have to take that as a sign\u00a0\u00a0 that something's going on you know it's not just\u00a0\na skin condition that pops up it's not something\u00a0\u00a0 that just happens that's you know mites on\u00a0\nyour skin that's incurable no it is a sign\u00a0\u00a0 from inside your body like hey something's going\u00a0\non here you guys like something's not you know in\u00a0\u00a0 balance something's going on like look internal\u00a0\nwhich i think is amazing i think it's so awesome\u00a0\u00a0 that our bodies do that so step number one like\u00a0\ni was saying is diet i really went hardcore into\u00a0\u00a0 diet at this time because i really really wanted\u00a0\nto take out everything that i could to balance out\u00a0\u00a0 issues you know that i was having so\u00a0\ni took out the gluten i took out dairy\u00a0\u00a0 which the functional medicine doctor and dr ben\u00a0\njohnson both said those two things are a huge\u00a0\u00a0 cause for so many people and skin conditions so i\u00a0\ntook those out of my diet completely and i i eat\u00a0\u00a0 clean like i still eat really clean and healthy\u00a0\nto this day but i made sure like back then i\u00a0\u00a0 just didn't cheat at all i just kept everything\u00a0\ngluten free dairy free and just ate very clean\u00a0\u00a0 and i can tell you that made a big difference\u00a0\nreally look at your diet take out you know\u00a0\u00a0 take out the dairy take out the gluten you can\u00a0\nlive without those two i promise you both of those\u00a0\u00a0 create such inflammation within our bodies that\u00a0\nit comes out in your skin and again it's something\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't see overnight you're not going to\u00a0\njust eat a piece of pizza and then tomorrow have\u00a0\u00a0 you know acne or rosacea it doesn't work like that\u00a0\nit takes a long time for your body to build up\u00a0\u00a0 all that inflammation and you know really throw\u00a0\noff your gut health it's not an overnight thing\u00a0\u00a0 but once you start to take those you know those\u00a0\nfactors out of your diet your body from the inside\u00a0\u00a0 will really start to heal and repair itself second\u00a0\nand this is a huge one for me is supplements\u00a0\u00a0 i really did not take any supplements back in\u00a0\nthe day and if you're familiar with me and my\u00a0\u00a0 channel now i talk about supplements all the time\u00a0\nbecause they changed my life they changed my skin\u00a0\u00a0 supplements are key so even with my son\u00a0\nlike i said he's 14 was dealing with acne\u00a0\u00a0 i put him on certain supplements and\u00a0\nit's what really really cleared his skin\u00a0\u00a0 so you can slap all the different skincare\u00a0\nproducts on that you want but if you're not\u00a0\u00a0 fixing internal issues you're never going to\u00a0\nhave the most beautiful perfect skin because\u00a0\u00a0 you're not you're always be playing catch up\u00a0\nwith what's going on internally you have to have\u00a0\u00a0 internal balance and then use your topical skin\u00a0\ncare products as like icing on the cake and\u00a0\u00a0 they both work together to create like amazing\u00a0\nbeautiful healthy skin so supplements to me are\u00a0\u00a0 like no joke i take my supplements every single\u00a0\nday i take a lot of supplements um but honestly\u00a0\u00a0 it's necessary because we are getting we're eating\u00a0\nfood that's you know grown in certain ways there's\u00a0\u00a0 all these like our food is not like real food\u00a0\nlike it was back in the long time ago days you\u00a0\u00a0 know like we're growing food and soils that have\u00a0\nall these like chemicals and just everything is so\u00a0\u00a0 different with our foods that our bodies aren't\u00a0\ngetting the nutrients that that they need it's\u00a0\u00a0 creating toxins and and you know imbalances within\u00a0\nour gut and that's what leads to a lot of people\u00a0\u00a0 having skin conditions skin conditions are on the\u00a0\nrise because of the foods we eat because we're not\u00a0\u00a0 really supplementing and taking care of our gut\u00a0\nand our health internally so supplements are key\u00a0\u00a0 and the key supplements that you really really\u00a0\nwant to look for i'm going to share with you\u00a0\u00a0 exactly what i recommend to take if you have\u00a0\nrosacea because these will change your life\u00a0\u00a0 the first one that i'm going to talk about is\u00a0\nthis because this is a must you guys it's the\u00a0\u00a0 osmosis skin clarifier 10 day blemish cleanse\u00a0\nso i always joke with ben i'm like it shouldn't\u00a0\u00a0 really be called blemish cleanse because it's\u00a0\nhonestly good for all skin types no matter even\u00a0\u00a0 if you have a skin condition or not it's so good\u00a0\nthough for acne and rosacea people like it really\u00a0\u00a0 clears your skin so it's a 10-day cleanse and what\u00a0\nthis does is it pulls every like toxin and gunk\u00a0\u00a0 out of your like track like your digestion and\u00a0\nyour gut which is that's where skin conditions\u00a0\u00a0 start from its digestion and its gut health so\u00a0\nthis cleanse i mean it doesn't make you like\u00a0\u00a0 run to the bathroom every five seconds or anything\u00a0\nthere's no like weird side effects like that\u00a0\u00a0 at all but you will notice it in your skin so\u00a0\nit's a 10 day cleanse now if you have rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 i highly suggest three back-to-back cleanses if\u00a0\nyou're just starting out with like you know curing\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea you need three of these back-to-back\u00a0\nso it's gonna be 30 days of taking eight pills in\u00a0\u00a0 the morning and eight pills at night but it\u00a0\nis worth it because this will save your skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is the first step to really really just\u00a0\ncleaning out all the gunk that has been built\u00a0\u00a0 up in your digestion and in your gut and there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market this is actually\u00a0\u00a0 like a mucus cleanse basically because again so\u00a0\nmany foods that we eat our bodies are creating you\u00a0\u00a0 know its own mucus all the time but so much like\u00a0\nyou know dairy and just foods that we eat actually\u00a0\u00a0 cause more mucus in our bodies and a lot of times\u00a0\nmucus built up in your body is a form of like\u00a0\u00a0 like inflammation too so um it you have like\u00a0\na build up of mucus and it's always lining our\u00a0\u00a0 digestion in our gut and this is cleans it out\u00a0\nlike this is like we'll clean out all of that\u00a0\u00a0 so it's a must it's the very very first step to\u00a0\ngetting clear skin if you have rosacea now for me\u00a0\u00a0 personally i do still take this a hundred percent\u00a0\ni take this like every other month but i usually\u00a0\u00a0 only do one to two back to back instead of the\u00a0\nthree but again if you're just starting out with\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea and you really wanna work to clear it\u00a0\nyou're gonna wanna start with the highest dose\u00a0\u00a0 which is three back-to-back cleanses then these\u00a0\nare the other ones that i highly suggest you guys\u00a0\u00a0 the truth treatments blemish repair complex\u00a0\namazing for rosacea amazing for acne my son\u00a0\u00a0 takes this every single day and it really\u00a0\nreally helps his skin as well i take this\u00a0\u00a0 every single day i will never be without this\u00a0\nthis is a supplement that i take every day\u00a0\u00a0 whereas this you know skin cleanse is more of like\u00a0\na cleanse and i take that cleanse like every other\u00a0\u00a0 month or so just to really clean out everything\u00a0\nand to keep all the gum buildup all of that\u00a0\u00a0 this is more along the lines of like the perfect\u00a0\ningredients that your skin needs to stay healthy\u00a0\u00a0 i mean this has your vitamin a it's got all your\u00a0\ndifferent vitamin b's vitamin d3 it has chromium\u00a0\u00a0 selenium copper zinc nack nac like truly\u00a0\ntruly everything that your skin needs to stay\u00a0\u00a0 balanced to have clear amazing skin so whether\u00a0\nyou have acne rather you have rosacea this is a\u00a0\u00a0 supplement that you have to take daily because it\u00a0\nwill 100 100 help your skin that's a must as well\u00a0\u00a0 as the truth treatments the fulvic cellular\u00a0\nrepair complex so this is literally all your\u00a0\u00a0 minerals your nutrients it's got fulvic acid but\u00a0\nit's got so much like necessary like amino acids\u00a0\u00a0 and nutrients that your body cannot get it can't\u00a0\nabsorb from the foods that we eat on a daily basis\u00a0\u00a0 and this makes a huge difference with like\u00a0\nbringing down the redness and the inflammation in\u00a0\u00a0 your skin it's amazing this is definitely one that\u00a0\nyou want to be taking every single day as well and\u00a0\u00a0 then these two are a must now i have been taking\u00a0\nprobiotics forever ever since i started my like\u00a0\u00a0 supplement journey probiotic daily is a must for\u00a0\ngut health you have to be a probiotic prebiotic\u00a0\u00a0 absolute must now i've gone through\u00a0\nso many in the past however many years\u00a0\u00a0 this is the one i'm using right now and i swear\u00a0\nthere is no probiotic slash prebiotic better\u00a0\u00a0 than this one i have felt such a difference\u00a0\nsince being on this i've been taking this for\u00a0\u00a0 maybe like three to four months now and it's\u00a0\ninsane i feel so good like i always have to\u00a0\u00a0 deal with like bloating and digestion issues\u00a0\nall of that and ever since i started taking this\u00a0\u00a0 there's none of that i take this before bed and\u00a0\ni literally like wake up i have like my stomach's\u00a0\u00a0 flat not bloated there's so many times like i will\u00a0\neat like crappy food that i know i shouldn't be\u00a0\u00a0 eating for dinner or something and i know like\u00a0\nhalf the time i would wake up and just be like\u00a0\u00a0 bloated and gross afterwards not with this like\u00a0\nthere's been none of that since i've been taking\u00a0\u00a0 this and it just i feel like light inside like\u00a0\ni feel good and it also really controls like\u00a0\u00a0 being regular if you know what i mean a lot of\u00a0\npeople who have digestion issues and gut issues\u00a0\u00a0 that is a big thing and that is a huge thing\u00a0\nfor skin issues you have to like keep everything\u00a0\u00a0 moving so that nothing's like building up\u00a0\nand not gonna be coming out on your skin\u00a0\u00a0 toxins are always going to find a way to come out\u00a0\non your skin a prebiotic probiotic is a must and\u00a0\u00a0 this is something i will never be without as well\u00a0\nand honestly the symbiotica probiotic this is the\u00a0\u00a0 best thing for gut health probiotic wise ever\u00a0\nso this is a must anyone everyone should be on a\u00a0\u00a0 probiotic but if you have acne if you have rosacea\u00a0\nthat means you are struggling with gut health\u00a0\u00a0 and this is needed daily and the other thing that\u00a0\ni want to mention is the osmosis digestive support\u00a0\u00a0 enzymes the digestive enzymes they actually come\u00a0\nin a different packaging now i have some backups\u00a0\u00a0 of the old packaging but the digestive enzymes\u00a0\nby osmosis are amazing the best digestive enzymes\u00a0\u00a0 i've ever used you can take one or two of these\u00a0\nbefore every meal and it just helps your body\u00a0\u00a0 to digest so you start losing like your natural\u00a0\nenzymes to break up food you lose them as you get\u00a0\u00a0 older so that's why you notice a lot more like\u00a0\ndigestion issues and gut issues and bloating as\u00a0\u00a0 you get older so a lot of times it's so necessary\u00a0\nto supplement with the right enzymes to really\u00a0\u00a0 help break down that food and to really help your\u00a0\nbody absorb the nutrients that it's that it's you\u00a0\u00a0 know taking in if you don't you're like losing\u00a0\nthem or it's building up in like toxin waste\u00a0\u00a0 in your body and stuff so digestive enzymes are\u00a0\ndefinitely you know i would say along the lines\u00a0\u00a0 of everything i take here it's a must as well i\u00a0\ndo think these core ones that i talked about first\u00a0\u00a0 are your most key components but if you have the\u00a0\nextra time or the extra want for digestive enzymes\u00a0\u00a0 they definitely do make a difference you will\u00a0\ndefinitely notice a difference and just taking\u00a0\u00a0 this before every meal really really helps so\u00a0\nthat is another key factor so we have number one\u00a0\u00a0 really look at your diet number two you have\u00a0\nto supplement you have to get your gut health\u00a0\u00a0 in check you have to be on the right supplements\u00a0\nit's going to make a huge difference for your skin\u00a0\u00a0 number one in my book at this point in my skin\u00a0\njourney supplements is the key for me if i get off\u00a0\u00a0 my supplements i notice a difference with my skin\u00a0\nto this day because stuff starts to not work and i\u00a0\u00a0 get you know off balance internally supplements\u00a0\nare that that important all right so step three\u00a0\u00a0 final step that you really need to take to cure\u00a0\nyour rosacea is again your topical skin care\u00a0\u00a0 so we start with the internal and then it does\u00a0\nmatter you know what skincare you use topically\u00a0\u00a0 and again that is how i discovered osmosis way\u00a0\nback in the day before anyone knew of osmosis um\u00a0\u00a0 i love this brand to this day i've been using this\u00a0\nbrand for honestly like six or seven years now\u00a0\u00a0 whenever i discover them which if you've been with\u00a0\nmy channel for a long time you remember that and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it was probably about seven years ago\u00a0\nthat is how long i've used this brand and it's\u00a0\u00a0 amazing not only do i love like the osmosis\u00a0\napproach because everything's more holistic\u00a0\u00a0 ben johnson is like ahead of his time he's\u00a0\nbeen using formulations and ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 that are only now like people are like oh yeah\u00a0\nlike retinaldehyde that's like a amazing form\u00a0\u00a0 of vitamin a like there's a lot of like his\u00a0\ningredients that are only now people are like\u00a0\u00a0 oh i'm starting to hear about this ingredient\u00a0\nthey've been in osmosis for years and their\u00a0\u00a0 products work so beyond amazing because of it um\u00a0\nbut the brand itself is very holistic and very\u00a0\u00a0 different than a lot of skincare brands\u00a0\nout there so osmosis is all about\u00a0\u00a0 you know no inflammation to your skin he does\u00a0\nnot believe in ripping apart the skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 there are so many brands out there that are harsh\u00a0\nthat are using harsh products or harsh ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 and they're ripping apart your skin barrier\u00a0\nthey're promoting inflammation to your skin and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation is something we don't want we don't\u00a0\nwant inflammation internally but we also don't\u00a0\u00a0 want to be you know inflaming our skin barrier all\u00a0\nthe time either which a lot of skin care brands do\u00a0\u00a0 so that is why um the osmosis products work\u00a0\namazing if you have rosacea because they\u00a0\u00a0 it completely changed my skin like this\u00a0\nline completely changed my skin once i\u00a0\u00a0 you know started balancing you know my internal\u00a0\nissues out with supplements and then using\u00a0\u00a0 the osmosis products topically that is where\u00a0\ni was like wow like i saw insane changes and\u00a0\u00a0 that is what's got me to my skin today so osmosis\u00a0\nproducts the ones that i will say are an absolute\u00a0\u00a0 must if you want to cure your rosacea are going\u00a0\nto be these rescue you guys heard me talk about\u00a0\u00a0 this so much if you are familiar with my\u00a0\nchannel this is all about epidermal repair\u00a0\u00a0 and knocking out inflammation there's nothing like\u00a0\nthis on the market either this truly truly knocks\u00a0\u00a0 out inflammation from deep within your skin\u00a0\nand you need to get rid of that if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea you have a lot of inflammation going\u00a0\non in your skin this is going to knock out the\u00a0\u00a0 redness this is going to help with like the\u00a0\npores and the bumps all of that you need to\u00a0\u00a0 get rid of that inflammation and knock it out\u00a0\nand this is a must this will save your skin\u00a0\u00a0 also the vitamin a's the osmosis vitamin a\u00a0\nproducts again retinaldehyde so much better than\u00a0\u00a0 retinol retinol is still inflaming your skin your\u00a0\nretinol is less potent than your retinaldehydes\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not even as powerful you know you know\u00a0\nin terms of getting that anti-aging effect\u00a0\u00a0 um but retinol is also like i said you're\u00a0\ngonna get peeling you're gonna get flaky\u00a0\u00a0 skin retinaldehyde has no peeling no flaking and\u00a0\nit's truly like one conversion away in the skin\u00a0\u00a0 to retinoic acid so it's amazing for anti-aging\u00a0\nit's been clinically studied again more and more\u00a0\u00a0 for formulators and dermatologists are like oh my\u00a0\ngosh retinaldehyde like that's an ingredient like\u00a0\u00a0 everybody should be talking about using it's like\u00a0\nthe future of vitamin a but osmosis again has been\u00a0\u00a0 using retinal to hide as their vitamin a forever\u00a0\nnow when i first started osmosis when i had\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea i was using calm so calm is your lowest\u00a0\nstrength right now to hide but it changed my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like it literally changed my skin it was so\u00a0\namazing because not only is it your vitamin a and\u00a0\u00a0 like anti-aging but there's so many calming and\u00a0\nlike anti-inflammatory ingredients and it's just\u00a0\u00a0 amazing like for your skin so i highly recommend\u00a0\nit and if you are you know dealing with rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 start with the calm again i'm using renu now which\u00a0\nis the highest strength but i did work my way\u00a0\u00a0 up to that so you basically just pump you\u00a0\nknow some out on your finger you do need the\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist this is part of the whole\u00a0\nliposomal delivery system which is amazing\u00a0\u00a0 it's the best form of delivery system for skin\u00a0\ncare that you can possibly find liposomal delivery\u00a0\u00a0 system if a skin care has that you know they're\u00a0\nlegit because that is the best form that really\u00a0\u00a0 takes the actives of every product and delivers\u00a0\nthem to the skin cell and it stays active the\u00a0\u00a0 liposomal delivery system will draw in that active\u00a0\nand keep it active the whole time it's traveling\u00a0\u00a0 through your skin whereas a lot of other products\u00a0\na lot of brands out there sephora to name a few\u00a0\u00a0 they don't even have delivery systems um\u00a0\nbut then there's other delivery systems that\u00a0\u00a0 will pull the product or the active through your\u00a0\nskin but the active ingredient loses its potency\u00a0\u00a0 you know as it's traveling through to the skin\u00a0\ncell so liposomal delivery system again another\u00a0\u00a0 key component to skin care and it makes another\u00a0\nreason you know it makes the osmosis products\u00a0\u00a0 so so effective but like i was saying when you're\u00a0\nusing their vitamin a serums again rosacea start\u00a0\u00a0 with calm but you will absolutely love it you take\u00a0\na pump of it and then you missed some of the boost\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist with it and then you massage it\u00a0\ninto your skin that's all you have to do but the\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist is needed with it because it is\u00a0\npart of the product and the whole delivery aspect\u00a0\u00a0 stop using your retin-a stop using your retinols\u00a0\nthey're ripping apart your skin and when you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea you are all about anti-inflammatory\u00a0\nproducts and you have to really take care of\u00a0\u00a0 your skin barrier this is one thing that i really\u00a0\nreally started focusing on was my skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 because a lot of times with people you know who\u00a0\nhave rosacea they have a broken down skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 it's you know irritated it's more inflamed and\u00a0\nyou have to build up your skin barrier it's a must\u00a0\u00a0 so many times you know rosacea acne patients\u00a0\nand people they have a broken down skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 one because those skin conditions cause kind of\u00a0\na breakdown in the skin barrier but two is like\u00a0\u00a0 you just don't know what you're using and you're\u00a0\nusing too harsh of ingredients and you really have\u00a0\u00a0 to baby your skin stop exfoliating stop the crazy\u00a0\nretinols and the retin-a and stuff like that and\u00a0\u00a0 just really baby your skin and really really focus\u00a0\non skin barrier health that's key to where you\u00a0\u00a0 you know really want to start as well and the two\u00a0\nproducts i would recommend for really building\u00a0\u00a0 up your skin barrier sente dermal repair ultra\u00a0\nnourish use this at night you can use it during\u00a0\u00a0 the day as well as your moisturizer but it's got\u00a0\neverything in it that your skin needs to create a\u00a0\u00a0 healthy skin bear it makes such a difference and\u00a0\ni promise you once you really start taking care\u00a0\u00a0 of your skin and using the correct products\u00a0\nand really focusing on skin barrier health\u00a0\u00a0 you will see a difference as well night and day\u00a0\nwith your rosacea this is a product that i used\u00a0\u00a0 way back when i had rosacea and it made such a\u00a0\ndifference you guys and i actually have not talked\u00a0\u00a0 about this recently it's the osmosis immerse and\u00a0\nit's a emu oil facial oil and i've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this years ago because it honestly made a huge\u00a0\ndifference with my skin so it's an emu oil based\u00a0\u00a0 facial product and it's very anti-inflammatory it\u00a0\nliterally knocks out inflammation but at the same\u00a0\u00a0 time hydrates your skin so amazing and the other\u00a0\ningredients that he has in here are just kind of\u00a0\u00a0 like more natural ingredients like more natural\u00a0\ntype of anti-inflammatory ingredients and it makes\u00a0\u00a0 a huge difference with your rosacea you will\u00a0\nnotice that your skin will start to clear\u00a0\u00a0 up and i swear by this product and then the\u00a0\nlast thing that i would definitely suggest is\u00a0\u00a0 a product like this which is your dna repair\u00a0\nso osmosis has the catalyst ac 11 dna repair\u00a0\u00a0 but then the photozyme md the dna repair brand\u00a0\nas well you need dna repair because it's again\u00a0\u00a0 helping to heal your skin from within dna repair\u00a0\nreally helps with like facial redness and also\u00a0\u00a0 broken capillaries all of that will actually help\u00a0\nto heal itself with dna repair so that is a must\u00a0\u00a0 as well again when you're thinking skincare\u00a0\nand you're really starting you know from the\u00a0\u00a0 very beginning of curing your rosacea stay away\u00a0\nfrom exfoliating for a while and then also stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from like harsh like ingredients stay away\u00a0\nfrom your retin-a's stay away from your retinols\u00a0\u00a0 work on your skin bearer and use skin barrier\u00a0\nlike anti-inflammatory products osmosis will be\u00a0\u00a0 your best friend i can promise you that um and\u00a0\nthat's where i am today that is everything i'm\u00a0\u00a0 doing that's everything i've done with my skin and\u00a0\nlike i said honestly now after all these years i\u00a0\u00a0 actually can eat some dairy and i can eat some\u00a0\ngluten because my body is balanced out i am\u00a0\u00a0 constantly like i said taking the skin the skin\u00a0\ncleanse skin clarifier cleanse i take that every\u00a0\u00a0 other month to make sure everything is cleaned out\u00a0\nin my track you know my digestion track and all of\u00a0\u00a0 that so it allows me to you know not be so strict\u00a0\nwith my diet but that's me now i can only get away\u00a0\u00a0 with doing that now because i've really you know\u00a0\ntook control and balanced everything out it is all\u00a0\u00a0 about balancing internal issues so step one diet\u00a0\nstep two key key issue is supplements get on those\u00a0\u00a0 supplements it will make a huge difference and\u00a0\nthen step three is your topical skin care and\u00a0\u00a0 you need to you know focus on everything that i\u00a0\njust talked about with the topical skincare and\u00a0\u00a0 the three of those steps combined i promise\u00a0\nyou you will see a difference with your skin\u00a0\u00a0 a hundred percent now again this is what worked\u00a0\nfor me it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 100 work the same for you i'm not a doctor this\u00a0\nis just my experience but i can promise you that\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea is not incurable it is not\u00a0\nsomething that you can't treat yourself\u00a0\u00a0 and it's something that you don't need to take\u00a0\nantibiotics for antibiotics actually ruin your gut\u00a0\u00a0 health and that's why so many times when you're on\u00a0\nan antibiotic for rosacea or for acne because they\u00a0\u00a0 throw those things at you like crazy when you go\u00a0\nto the doctor for those skin conditions you start\u00a0\u00a0 taking them and then you have to get off them and\u00a0\nyour acne comes back worse your rosacea comes back\u00a0\u00a0 worse because you actually just messed up\u00a0\nyour entire like microbiome gut health all\u00a0\u00a0 of that because the bad bacteria overtakes\u00a0\nthe good bacteria and you're even worse off\u00a0\u00a0 when you really look at your body and your\u00a0\ndiet and you know all of that internal stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that's your key to treating and curing your\u00a0\nrosacea it is not like an incurable disease\u00a0\u00a0 it is a hundred percent curable your body\u00a0\nis just telling you there's something off\u00a0\u00a0 so that is it you guys i hope this video helped\u00a0\nyou out it's something that i get asked about\u00a0\u00a0 all the

beginning of my journey she has an extremely inspirational story she's on Instagram as Lonestar Kido and is also a meet rx coach is that that's correct right so I see now has I mean she's had this amazing healing journey story that we're gonna talk about but she also helps others as a part of her daily life now which i think is just absolutely so amazing so thanks for coming on amber thank you so much for having me this is really fun yeah awesome well I'm glad too and I guess just tell everyone a little bit about your weight loss story I know that she had diabetes at one point like you've you've got a lot you peeled a lot of weight gain and loss which I relate to quite a bit so let's just jump right in there okay I'll kind of give you a background starting from a very young age I was about 10 years old when I realized that I was a little bit different than your typical ten year old child I started developing a little earlier and along with that there was a little bit more weight I mean not bad if you look at my pictures you don't really see me as I had chubby cheeks but other than that it was not a fat child but compared to the other little girls they were born flat very thin and so I was kind of made fun of plus I was really short and so you know you I wasn't necessarily that I got picked on but it was enough to make me realize I wasn't like everybody else so it put this thing in my head that there was something wrong with me and I I kind of had that in the back of my mind I didn't know what to do with it I was 10 years old you know but I also watched my mom continually diet because our family is has a very big history of all kinds of health conditions and obesity and so my mom was very scared about that so she was always on a perpetual diet like I think I watched her eat only salads for like 30 years you know seriously so that was kind of in my head too that that is something that you know you to do and it just kind of morphed into this thing where I was so unhappy with my body that by the age of 15 I was full-blown bulimic and anorexic and I was taking diuretics and laxatives and diet pills because back then you could buy it over the care and that you know those people were talking about that was really strong ones that are now banned yeah I did all that and so you know by my senior year at when I was 17 summer before my senior year I was 17 I weighed a whopping 98 pounds granted I'm not very tall and 5 - but still 98 pounds and I was wearing a size of double zero and I was you know if I did eat I was purging it so I you know I can't even imagine what I was doing in my bones and my muscles I wasn't working out of course back then that was you know quite the thing yet it was going to get big in the eighties yeah you know that kind of just started this horrible you know obsessive addiction to food love-hate relationship if you will and you know the self-hatred for my body it's not that I hated myself as a person but I hated that my body would not cooperate with my mind what I wanted it to do and you know it was very irritating to see how other people could just eat whatever they wanted and do whatever they want and nothing seemed you know on the surface to be wrong and then here I was you know having to do all of this and yeah so that that was that was a really rocky start to my life right there with my you know relationship with food yeah yeah absolutely and so I've read a lot of your posts and things that you've written and said you've lost weight before you know had tremendous weight loss before but then it kind of always came back so talk a little bit about that oh yeah absolutely I lost 80 to 100 pounds four times three times and you know the first three times I lost that much weight by doing the typical calorie restriction Weight Watchers and name I was a big advocate for it you know it's balanced it's so balanced it's the best diet that's a balance balance balance about yeah that word you know and so I believe that I was doing what was right and I lost the way absolutely I have you know this crazy willpower there's no doubt about it I can lose weight not a problem I'm not saying that's fun or easy but I can do it yeah obviously four times but then I would start to freak when I would hit my maintenance mode because I knew I could not continue with that diet I knew it in my head I'm not denying it and you know thinking this time will be different right and so I I you know it just made this me very apprehensive and and sure enough you know self-fulfilling prophecy I would gain the weight back yeah and some of the times more and then I would do it all over again because obviously it was something I did wrong you know it was not the diet it was me and so I had to fix that there you know and so I would become more angry with myself and more angry with my body and you know then I'd lose the way it again and then and in between those big weight losses I was doing every other diet you can possibly imagine thinking I did for me you know pretty young age anyway and you know the Jenny Craig I even did at the age of I wasn't even 16 yet I did a medical supervised diet where you actually went in and you know you had your blood tested you had you know blood pressure and all this kind of stuff and they put you in a very specific very strict diet and my boyfriend at the time we just met my husband he actually paid for that and I got my dad to sign for because I knew my mom would not so I because you know was young and so I mean at that age obviously a medical supervised diet that's how crazy this was and then of course I've done the slimfast and what are those shakes no you know those different shakes I've tried so many yummy but oh my god I was hungry like you know 30 minutes later anyway these diets did not work so I would lose you know 20 pounds 30 pounds and then gain 50 and then I'd lose another 23rd gain 60 and then you know I have these big weight losses now all along if you kind of look at the trend I reached my heaviest I think it was what was it to 2008 I was over 240 pounds like I said I'm 5-2 and that was the last known weight and I am pretty sure it was quite a bit more and I did not weigh again so I had no idea how much I weight I actually totally lost because I lost a lot of weight before I would get on the scale because I was scared of what I was going to see so I lost a lot of weight that's when I lost 100 plus pounds I say a hundred cuz I know 100 but there was probably more because I didn't weigh I was too scared to weigh at the beginning that makes me get started yeah yeah it was it was just awful but I you know I reached my heavy weight and then I had a really really scary health scare I had gone and well okay I guess I should back this up because this is kind of important I think people do this they live in denial and I did I'm not stupid I know when there's something wrong with my body yeah and I had all these signs like I had a hard time breathing I couldn't go upstairs and it wasn't that so much that I was unfit as far as exercise or whatever that kind of thing I knew there's something internally wrong and my pulse would just rape my heart my heart would just no bubble bubble boom and the kitty litter like simple tasks like that took me over an hour to recover so I knew something was really wrong and I hid this from my husband I did not want him to know because I didn't want to have to admit there's something wrong right and so I hid this and I'm scared to death that I was gonna have a heart attack so I started taking baby aspirin too just in case there was you know something wrong like that I mean I don't even I I read an article and so I started taking baby aspirin it was just crazy stuff like that and it really hit a bad point when I had gone to Romance Writers of America a convention I used to be writer and where they were holding the convention there was like this where you part you had to go up this hill like this and my husband was walking me up because he drove me and dropped me off or whatever so I was walking up and I couldn't breathe I was dying oh my god I was dying and so as we're going to the room we're going up the elevator I'm trying not to breathe you don't like or just as shallow as I can they're going to feel like I really wanted to do and I mean at that point I knew there was something wrong anyway I ended up going to the doctor for something completely unrelated and they had you know they do the typical they check your blood pressure area and they were like honey I need for you to lay down and I was like what and they're like I need you to be really calm and I need you lay down and I was like okay and then the next thing you know they had another nurse come in and an assistant and the doctor and EKG machine and I'm like what in the heck and so they're hooking me up and my blood pressure was so incredibly high it was like 200 something over a hundred something it was like really it was like right at the stroke level and so they were kind of freaking out because that was not I hardly ever mentioned doctor but the last time my blood pressure wasn't that bad so comparatively they were like okay wait a minute here so they told me about if I didn't if the medication they were giving you did not work in 30 minutes they were taking me to the hospital and I was like oh my god because I don't do doctors and hospitals or no you know so that was scared me to death and I can remember after after they all settled of course that make you go to a cardiologist and do the stress test and all that I was put on four medications for one of them had a diuretic so I count that as four so it's three three pills but one of them had you know the diuretic component and so I was taking all that medication and when I went to see my regular doctor for the follow-up or whatever I just broke down in tears and I was like it's because of that right this is because I'm fat and to me that was the most horrifying thing to admit that my obesity had anything to do with my health and luckily my doctor was so cool and he was like you know okay sure sure he do need to lose some weight of course I was very obese at the time but he was trying to be really cool about it not freak me out or whatever but he was like there's more going on here and you know and bone loss so anyway that was and then after that I had one health sphere after another I found that I was pre-diabetic I had acid reflux so incredibly bad I couldn't even sleep at night if I even lean back like this acid would come up in the back of my throat it was awful I had he who wrote me a prescription for nexium I took it for eight years every day eight years yeah even when I was doing the Weight Watchers or whatever else to lose the way because I did kick my booty in the year with the with you know the dieting to get that weight off because it scared him so bad and then I started exercising like obsessively to the point where now I understand I had a disorder I had that anorexia athletic now they have a name for it but I was exercising six days a week from two to five hours every day and it was you name it I did it I did body pump I did free weights I did Zumba I did you name it every I did back-to-back classes I went to four different gyms to get all my classes I traveled constantly and that was my job all day long that's what I did and that's kind of partly why am i riding with you know because I was so busy you know obsessing over that and you know yeah so that's kind of pretty much horribly I didn't like I said I lost the weight and I started to gain a little bit and then I would catch myself after you know this big health scare I caught myself and then I would lose again and then I would start to rise again but never quite getting it you know so when I started Kido I was already not at my heaviest I was I think I was like 180 something yeah and so it wasn't quite as bad as my heavy as I never quite let myself get there or actually it was more than 240 but yeah and that was you know one of those things because as soon as I hit maintenance I knew I couldn't stick with it anymore I couldn't you know it was the most miserable thing and I was hungry all the time I was angry I was such an angry person and so even though I pretended like I was happy outside we'd go out with our friends and they would be drinking margaritas and having the chips and salsa which I love and I was just looking a white comedian it didn't even matter that my friends or some of them were overweight it didn't even matter I was jealous because I would not allow myself to do that but it upset me but they did allow themselves to do it and they seem to be okay with everything and I wasn't so you know I would make myself miserable I could go home and cry I would just cry because I I was just like why why do I have to be that person you know because I was so miserable you know it was just not a happy time at all even though I was like I don't know the site's the best thing I feel afraid I feel healthy you know all that kind of thing yeah inside I didn't want to admit it but yeah wasn't there I mean I so much of what you're saying I can relate to 100% just the number one getting to maintenance and being like more anxious because it's like to stay in maintenance is terrifying and we talk you know so much about weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss well you lose the weight then what do you do you know then what do you do how do you live the rest of your life so that you're not battling food addiction so that you're not constantly gaining and losing the weight so that's why I feel like I relate to you so much because I have been the person that has lost a hundred pounds and then gained it all back you know a couple of times and that really sucks and you know the other thing you touched on which i think is so important that we don't talk about enough in the community is health problems you know we were so weight loss focused but we don't talk about these severe health problems that you know a lot of us had as a result of the obesity you know as the result of the blood sugar you know the Weight Watchers the you know the ideology of low carb high carb and high sugar and low fat clearly that's gonna work for you otherwise you would have just lost that weight the first time and kept it off if it was a matter of calorie restriction and staying with you know the high carb low fat foods so you know talked about a little bit your transition takedo and maybe some of how some paradigms and things started to shift for you as a result of that switchover oh yeah and you know the one thing that if you want to say rigored you know i don't get triggered Harley and anymore but there are a few things that do and one of them is this oh well you know eat in moderation okay number one what exactly is moderation and is it the same for each person yeah not so much and what if you have food addiction are you supposed to moderate food addiction you know so that just irritates me to know in and the whole calories and calories out okay how did that work out for you Jay how did that work out for you okay yeah I lost the weight but big deal if I gained it all back and I got all my health problems you know amplified what good was that calories in calories out counting oh let me tell you I counted every little bitty calorie and you know people say oh you you know just the over estimate underestimated whatever you want to say no I didn't because I weighed every little morsel I track every single bite because remember I had this you know this obsessive disorder going on and I had to have this control and I had to know and monitor every single bite and I over guesstimated everything and on exercise I under guesstimate it so there is no way and okay yeah like I said I did lose away but anyway it came back on well okay I got to this point where I'm so unhappy with my body as I've been most of my life and my daughter had told me that a friend of hers was selling this product you know like your typical Herbalife or whatever kind of thing and she was gonna give it a go just just for the heck of it just to kind of see if it worked and I was like you know what I'm gonna do that too with you and just to use it as a catalyst because I'm one of those people were I kind of need a little help getting started but then once I start and get out of my way because I will reach my goal if I have to plow her video in the meantime because it's gonna happen you know what I mean and I don't care what it takes I'm gonna do it well so what it was I'll just tell you exiting those ketones okay and the first time I took it I was like so you're euphoric and so happy and not hungry not hangry I was like what is this stuff so I started doing a lot of research and in the meantime I'm taking the product or whatever and then that's when I learned about Kino and ketones I know what that was I've never heard of that because you know you hear Weight Watchers you hear calorie restriction you don't hear ketones and ketosis and you know lo carte well a little bit of low carb Atkins or whatever but for the most part you know it kind of pushed aside and so I had no idea but this product made me feel so incredibly awesome that it made me go out and research this wonderful thing and then I learned that you can do this yourself you can produce the ketones yourself and get the same and so the product kind of allowed me to kind of not have those cravings and stuff so when I started giving the carbs it couldn't matter I didn't care I could care less and then next thing you know I'm doing it on my own I am doing it on my own it's a piece of cake and I am so happy I looked at my husband and I said I can do this the rest of my life and he looked at me and he was like he could tell the difference in my you know attitude and you know the the joy of being on I was actually enjoying being on this diet I have never enjoyed a diet ever ever ever and so you know for this to be a diet or whatever and and you know I just started researching researching researching and the more I learned the more excited I got about it and I was like why is nobody know this why is this not out there why why you know if this makes such a huge difference I mean I was dropping weight and not even trying and I was able to pretty quickly go from instead of eating six little meals a day like you're told to do to eating one one meal a day Oh mad one meal because I was not hungry but that was on keto and I that to me was so amazing because then I didn't have to focus my whole day on food because I was a food at it and I was obsessed about food I mean when on the diets before I would eat and then I would start thinking about my next mill well when I was kiddo I didn't care and you know when I started keto I I did the treats I did the fat bombs I did all that stuff I did the recipes to duplicate what I used to love it in number one it was fun number two I'm a creative person number three I like recipes so I even started a keto recipe website which I still have up and I still very much believe in it but so you know I kind of did that whole typical keto thing that I think people do but for me I needed that progression I needed to you know excuse me gradually wean out all this other stuff and by the end of Keita when I had before us transition transition to carnivore I had weeded out the tree I had weeded out most of the sweeteners then you know all that kind of stuff and so I was it was when I did the corner where it was super easy because I was basically carnivore already just not the red meat because you know oh my goodness red meat now he eat chicken right he be white yes everything which I was still in my head doing on keto because that was so ingrained that kind of took me right up to Keita Wow and so with keto I mean you had so many amazing health benefits and I want people to hear that too because you know I don't think everyone necessarily has to go full-on carnivore in order to achieve their health goals I think it's a tool that people can utilize and it sounds like keto did so many amazing things for you but talk a little bit about that transition into karna where maybe some of the other benefits that you experienced once you transitioned into carnivore yeah absolutely okay I'll tell you what I kind of improved while on keto I lost the weight I lost like I don't know somebody something just just right under 80 pounds I had zero acid reflux I was off medication for that off the nexium after taking it for eight years I have zero indigestion that was huge acid reflux and I was able to get off two of my medication actually three if you want to count the diuretic so I was only left with one pill valsartan the small dose with no diuretic that was what I was left with and then what else did I say Oh what my rosacea yeah it had started to improve it was it was looking tons better but it was still there and rosacea for me was something that I mean of course obesity that's you know that's horrible embarrassing right but then to have you know this blazing face that people are is like oh wow we're worried you to get a sunburn you know later and I'm like and then I started having these little spider veins coming out of my nose like an alcoholic and I had started getting a little tiny tiny little almost like acne bumps little tiny but they itch then they burned and so the rosacea was just this horrible thing on top of being obese I mean like I really wanted to go out number one I look like crap and clothes and then I had this face that even makeup couldn't hide all the red and if it got rubbed up on my nose it would be like Rudolph meet me you know it was just awful so I didn't want to go out anywhere I didn't want to dress up I didn't you know so my my emotional and my mental was way way way back but Onkyo because of the weight loss the the rosacea going down feeling better just overall feeling better started feeling a little more confident started feeling more energy all that kind of thing really made me you know just want to you know hey life you know and so I actually started living life I started dressing up I started wearing jewelry I started wearing makeup again I started caring about what I look like I started going out dancing on the weekends with my husband and that is something I would have never done I would have never had the confidence because I'd be worried about who's that fat chick on the floor you know that kind of thing and so you know it's it's just so fun and okay so that's kind of what cleared up on keto but I still had a few things I had that one blood pressure medication I was on and I still had the rosacea now I thought that my digestive issues were so much better on keto that there wasn't any issue there I thought that was normal I I guess I should back up and say that since I was a little kid I'm talking a little kid I had issues some issues I mean I even had to have my that drink that chalky stuff and look and see what's inside I you know it was a mess but I had constipation I had bloating I had pain so bad that sometimes it would knock me to my knees and like I said from a little kid but I was a little kid who loved vegetables and I would rather have vegetables than anything I even ate a can of spinach for breakfast when I was a kid so I ate a lot of vegetables and I really liked them I was never vegetarian per se but I was very close to probably doing that anyway so password taquito things improved so much I thought that's what you must feel like awesome and I transitioned to carnivore and in the first week I was like what is this is digestion thing I had zero gas 0 bloating no constipation no nothing it was the most incredible thing and to me that was shocking I don't know why but it was shocking I kind of knew that I had an issue with added fiber because I knew like flax seeds and stuff like that gave me great pain and so I kind of knew but I never thought about the fiber and vegetables and stuff right so I thought that was good you're supposed to eat that you need that it's just the added stuff like flax and you know all that kind of stuff but anyway so within that first week I was like holy cow this is like the most awesome thing ever if nothing else because of how wonderful I felt I never want to eat another vegetable they don't appeal to me I look at them as little green clumps of pain you know after you realize how good you can feel me personally I won't speak for everybody but it was the most amazing thing and so that was a very shocking benefit of carlin work for me I don't you know I don't know why that was sure was just so shocking to me but it was and this month actually I'll be a year carnivore and it has taken me you know the two years Aikido and almost a full year of carnivore to start really seeing and my rosacea so you know I just have to caution people that you know they think oh I'm gonna go carnivore and all my rosacea step you got are my skin issues whatever it is psoriasis whatever well it doesn't necessarily work that way sometimes you have a lot of healing to do and you have to you know give it a go but if you look at it this way this is supposed to be a lifestyle you number one why would you want to go back to eating that stuff that caused you so much pain you know why it doesn't interest me anymore and you know and then to get the same effects that you had before you ever started that why would you want to do that so you know stick with it and just let it do it let it do its thing because you know she's kind of tricky they're they're kind of one of those things you got a really give it time but it is perfect all I can tell you is you know I look in the mirror now I'm not like oh god how much makeup do I have to put on today oh you know let me go check the mirror to make sure rudolph is not showing it is just so bad and digestion oh the blood pressure medication yeah yes I am medication for re0 meds zero supplements now I'm not saying I I may not ever take a supplement because you never know but for right now I'm taking nothing zero not my food is my medicine my food is my supplement so it is the most freeing thing I can't even tell you we went on our cruise in October I didn't have to do this little pill case you know all my vitamins and my you know blood pressure and you know just in case the acid reflux comes back I took nothing nothing it suffer I did take like some cold medication or it was just in case you never know and you don't want to be home to see with no way to do anything you know so I took some of that kind of stuff but none of that you know typical stuff that I always had to worry and stress over because oh my gosh what if my medication gets lost or at you know whatever not anymore it's like the most freeing thing oh and I guess I could mention two food addiction I lost a lot of that yeah yes and it it is gradually through this process from going you know low-carb keto to carnivore it has really given me the opportunity to kind of break away and look at food as a different thing like I said now I look at fruits and vegetables as something that gives me pain no I'm not trying to bad-mouth for its vegetables but for me it's not good yeah and you know I I have a different mindset I now look at something is it's not that I can't have it I don't want it no I'm it's not worth it to me now I'm not saying that I've never done anything bad because you know the little cruise I mentioned you know there are certain things that I do allow but I fully understand the consequences and I'm not one of those people who it's detrimental to you know stick you know so closely to the to the diet that you know bad things will happen I may have some consequences but they're not severe and there's nothing i can't ban get right back to and so I do allow that I'm not saying a perfect cuz I'm not but for the most part the addiction and for me I don't know about you but that is like one of the most free most awesome feelings ever and people don't understand that those that have been so you know who don't really care about food or they say they don't care about food but if you spend every waking moment and then soon as you wake up you're thinking of food you know they don't get it they don't get it and you know and then when when you've had to you know watch every bite you it becomes you know such a thing in your head yeah and so to be free of that it's wonderful and as much as I loved keto the part I didn't after a while at first I admit because I was control freak and I still had some issues I enjoyed the tracking to watch everything and measuring depending on old you know and when I went to carnivore it was kind of an interesting thing because I was like you know I have to worry about macros you don't have to you know watch every little thing okay this is kind of not really sure what to do with this so it was an adjustment period but it feels so good to just not have to worry about it anymore it's just you know pretty simple and because I'm not so worried about the you know food addiction or you know the obsessiveness with food I'm not so worried about overeating or anything like that it's number one for me I can't overeat me some people claim they can I can't and so you know it's just like it's got its automatic little turn off point and then BAM you're done so wonderful and now you've transitioned into coaching and helping others let's talk about that just a little bit as well yes yes um after like I mentioned before when I was on keto and I understood this amazing thing that was so incredibly easy and pleasant compared to all the years thirty whatever years it was actually was 40 years of you know this miserable existence I wanted to get that word out so I became a keto advocate and I tried to get the word out as best I could and then once I realized the benefits of carnivore I was like yeah I'm definitely gonna advocate for that too I mean I advocate from both don't you know to me carnivore is an extension of Kido so it's you know I'm saying I advocate for keto is the same as carnivore but I had the opportunity to become a carnivore coach their meat Rx and I jumped on it my husband was even like go for it because I was seriously considering going through one of those functional medicine kind of type of you know becoming not a dietitian but yeah you something like that I was really looking into that my husband said you know what if that's what you need to do let's do it and then I came across that and I said you know what let me do this first and let me see if this is something I really enjoy and I love it because you get to talk with people and they get to have you know some light bulb it's like you did know you know and then they're like and then to hear some of the feedback that how it's improved for them it is like the most amazing thing and to me you know being able to help other people and to pass this knowledge on is is awesome that's you know besides keeping my grandbaby's that's what my day consists of research and you know advocating coaching you know interviewing whatever I can to get the word out we're doing interviews like this you know just to get that word out there and I think it's so important because it's becoming more mainstream at least Quito is a little bit and that's you know but you know like I'm sure you saw the doctors with Paul Saladino and how that went down and to me that is so shocking I don't know why I think it's shocking but it was to me there happens all the time and you see it all over social media and it just makes me sad because that could be something that really helps somebody especially those with you know like autoimmune issues mental illness if nothing else is working why is that such a bad thing I mean personally I think that's the first thing you should try but you know that doesn't happen but you know III just feel that the word needs to get out there to let people know that there might be an option for them it doesn't mean you have to do that or you have to do it forever like you said Quito is perfectly fine probably for most people but there are some and unfortunately I kind of think I fall in that category that needs to go more carnivore not that I have to be as strict as others I can still have some play but yeah unfortunately it's just the way it is but honestly now that I've broken the food addiction the carbonation the sugary addiction whatever you want to call it it's not a big deal it's just not I have people ask me all the time you know don't you feel like you're missing out on something no because here's the thing if I really wanted something I'd have it I'm an adult nobody's gonna tell me I can't I choose not to because I don't want to if I wanted to believe me I take a big ol bite of it but you know just I don't care like the bread on the table at a safe restaurant don't bring it my husband and I both luckily you know not that it would bother me anyway but you know we just automatic and you know yes not only are you sure you want to suck meat only I don't care so it's not a big deal yeah I think I admit sometimes this weird part of me though and I think it's because I used to do cake decorating and I did desserts and you know that kind of thing and I did recipes that I appreciate the the pretty yeah I like the fix so I like to look at dessert menus just because they're pretty not because I care I don't know what what that is but I think it's just a artistic kind of part I don't know but I don't desire it as far as you know craving it or wanting it I just like to look at pretty things it's like this bizarre thing I like to do but other than that you know I could care less are really good I get it I mean we just those old habits kind of die hard and the important thing is that you've gotten to that place in your mind and in your heart where you're like it just I don't care I don't want it like the bread we were at a restaurant the other night and I was like let me just actually keep the butter cuz I probably want to have a little extra for my steak but you can take the basket I'll keep the butter just take the bread you know and with the dessert my husband had half of it and I just didn't even go for it because I'm just like you know if I had really really wanted it I would have a little by the dessert but I just didn't want to bother with it you know I just you just get to that point where you feel so good or like I just don't want to screw this up you know and that is one of the miracles I think of carnivore because when I was doing Weight Watchers and all those other diets I was really never at that point it was always like me trying to trick myself and say well I can have a cheat meal or for this event I'm just gonna blow it all out I'm gonna eat whatever I want and then I would end up feeling absolutely horrible and then I could go down that rabbit hole again of possibly gaining all the weight back because you know one vacation or one cheat day or whatever could turn into months of something you know I mean I'm salute like yeah it's it's great to be kind of on the other side of those behaviors and those thoughts in general you know which is what I'm so glad to have you on the channel and I think so many people are going to be able to relate to what you're saying anything that you would want to say to somebody who is maybe watching that is really really struggling can just relate to your journey just Amber's words of advice oh yeah absolutely I think one thing that is super important is unfortunately still you know especially carnivore is treated like it's the sound my gosh crazy far out there fad thing and you're gonna get a lot of slack from friends and family and people you don't even know but you know what who cares blow it off just don't worry about I know it's kind of hard at the beginning but the more you do it the more you know like if you go to a family dinner say and I took a lot of flack when I first started doing this but I would bring my own food if I knew that there wasn't gonna be something specific like if they were cooking barbecue I knew okay I could have barbecue or whatever so long as you know they didn't marinate it and I knew based on my family converse you know so I bring my own food and a little while there I would get some you know slack about that and then I'm like no but why does somebody care what I eat anyway did they care when I was stuffing my face full of crap and weighed 240 plus pounds did they say anything no but goodness gracious I eat just meat oh you know and so it's baffling but you just gotta you know you don't owe anybody an explanation I guess is what I'm trying to say and if somebody says oh you can't have that just rephrase that to him and say well you know what actually I can but I just choose not to because it makes me feel really bad so I don't like my body to feel that way and you know if you just kind of reset that that way of thinking that is so huge because your mind oh my goodness your mind can do so much it help you Oricon are you so be really careful how you talk to yourself and how you you know phrase things because your mind has pay attention and you don't even realize it yeah yeah I love that that's great advice and anyone out there who might want to find you follow you or even work with you and meter X how would they go about finding you yes

        "transcript": "Aloha my name is Brady barrows I wrote the rosacea diet like to talk about it more in details this book that I just showed you came out in 2002 it was three several revisions that I made however I came out in October of 2007 with this book rosacea 101c and this book is 373 pages and it's well worth the price because it contains a lot more information than just the rosacea diet however you can still buy the rosacea diet pretty much the way it was and the new version have got a few new things in there but basically it's the same so I'd like to just discuss it with you hundreds of people have tried the rosacea diet and they say that it works I don't have thousands but I do have hundreds of people tell me that it works I have a rosacea diet user support group with Yahoo and many report that it really does work for them it's a very difficult diet and most rosacea pne's just cannot do this diet and I understand not everyone wants to control rosacea with their diet they want some other way to control it but if that's what you want to try I what I do is I tell people it's only 30 days this diet and you'll know in about 30 days whether this diet works most people get results and they can see that it works in about 30 days however some a few have reported that it takes longer than 30 days it takes 60 90 120 days for them because their rosacea is so severe however they do notice increments of improvement now what is it what is the nutshell version of this diet it's a very strict diet it's completely different from the way that you're eating you need to reduce sugar in your diet because basically the rosacea engine is burning on glucose and what you need to do is alter your metabolism and the only way you can do this is to change from your current high carbohydrate diet to a high protein diet and this will change your metabolism when you go through this change many rotations report headaches they report it isn't many it's actually some rotations report headaches lethargy they're just tired they they don't feel good because their metabolism is changing from what happened is you have a insulin dominant metabolism and when you have this insolent dominant metabolism this is inflammatory for your rosacea and that's what is really triggering the rosacea what you can do though is you can really read my diet I give two versions I have a meat eaters diet I call it the carnivore diet and you can follow that for 30 days I suggest what to eat but I want you to understand you can change the the plan that I have to fit you you don't have to use what I suggest you can substitute meats you can substitute the vegetables that I suggest I also have a 30 day vegan diet I went vegan because I had had so many people tell me that they're strict vegetarians so I show you how to do it it's very difficult but it can be done so I urge you to try my diet and hopefully it'll work for you like it's worked for hundreds of others here's the book rosacea 101 Aloha you",
