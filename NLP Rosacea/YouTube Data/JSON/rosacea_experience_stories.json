        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "transcript": "if you are somebody who is suffering from rosacea right now and you have been to numerous doctors who told you that rosacea is incurable and then the only thing you can do is to try avoiding triggers in order to manage your redness forget all about this what I want you to hear right now is that rosacea is possible to be cured and you can feel like yourself again and you can have your healthy and normal and happy life back I'm somebody who had rosacea for 10 years years of my life I had my rosacea since I was 18 Till I was 28 and now I'm 29 and I didn't have any rosacea flare up for a year already these are my before and afters and I know that my skin doesn't look like a perfect photoshopped super model skin at the moment but oh my God I couldn't be in a happier place right now with the way my skin looks at the moment my skin feels so healthy and glowy to me right now comparing to what it had been during the last 10 years and today I'm going to share with you what exactly I did in order to get this skin and I'm also going to share with you all of the things that they say are supposed to help you with rosacea but they didn't do anything for me let's go welcome back my friends if if you're new on this channel my name is Anna and here I talk about beauty style and everything that can make us love our life a little bit more and please support my channel by clicking the like button down below this really helps me grow my audience and grow my channel and create more videos like this one for you and subscribe if you haven't yet of course thank you so much let's get back to our topic of rosacea and before you start your rosacea Journey please make sure that what you have is actually rosacea any dermatologist will be able to diagnose it for you we can never know why we get rosacea and we can never find out the exact reasons why rosacea starts and I don't have anybody in my family who has ever had rosacea that's why nobody could really tell me what I have and how I can get better I was feeling really miserable during the last 5 years especially the way rosacea looked for me is that I was getting redness on my face it was focused on my cheeks in this area and on my chin uh during the last two years of my rosacea I also started having it on my nose and on my forehead in here and uh it was not only redness it was also pimples like breakouts that I would cut and those pimples they were so stubborn it it's not like a normal tiny pimple that you can just squeeze out and then it's going to be healed after 2 days that is something that if you try to squeeze it nothing will change about it it will stay so there is no point of trying to do anything to it and actually I had some pimples that stayed on my face for years like for a year at least that's for sure like it didn't go away it didn't get any smaller it didn't get any bigger nothing changed about it and I was just living with those things on my face and I know how Rosa can make you feel it can make you feel like you hate your skin and you hate yourself and that's what happened to me I got to the point where I was hating myself for not doing enough for not being strong enough to deal with this problem and I would hate the fact that I felt like I had to wear makeup to just leave my house I had to wear makeup all the time because when I was not wearing my makeup I felt like I looked like a monster and that I felt embarrassed of my bare skin and the only times when I would leave my house without any makeup was to go to see a new doctor and when I was going to see a new doctor I would go without makeup and I would want this doctor to see my bare skin I would want him to see how bad it is for me and how I'm suffering uffing and I thought that this could actually make him realize that I need help and the feeling of visiting a new doctor every time was so it was hard because every time you go to a new one you are full of hope you think maybe this time it's going to be it maybe this time it's going to be a person who's going to help me and I'm finally going to be cured but the disappoint man every time after it doesn't work it was tremendous and it was so painful when you when you go out there like I remember one time I was seeing this lady and I came to her office I showed her my skin I showed her pictures of how terrible my skin looks on some days and I was I was feeling so embarrassed of of myself of my skin and everything that she said to me is that Rosa is incurable you can you can't do anything about it you can try cantra but really nothing can be done so just goodbye that was that was the moment that I've had enough and I decided that I'm going to do more and that I'm going to finally take Serious steps and deal with it so I think I've had enough talking let's get actually to the things that they say are supposed to help you but they didn't help me at all and in the end I will say what helped me in fact among of the things that doctors say are supposed to help you with rosace is dieting and avoiding certain types of food and drinks and I've tried them all I've tried not drinking alcohol not drinking coffee caffeine not drinking coffee and alcohol at the same time not eating any red fruits or vegetables not eating anything red like ketchup as well and like tomato paste anything red it was a no no for me not eating gluten not eating sugar not eating diary products I had a phases when I had to avoid all of these products completely and all of these efforts brought me nothing with dieting out of the way we are moving to probiotics and vitamins I try taking probiotics vitamins different ones didn't do a thing for me next thing is uh skincare products for rosacea skincare products which are supposed to help with rosacea are not actually helping you cure rosacea what they can do is that they can help you kind of sooth and calm down your breakouts a little bit maybe dry them out a little bit but they never really helped me deal with my breakouts completely and what skincare uh products definitely don't do is that they don't prevent new breakouts from coming so new breakouts uh and new flare ups happen anyway doesn't matter what kind of uh like gentle skin care or expensive skincare products you use but uh bad skincare products can actually make you feel worse so really be careful with the skin care that you use if you have rosace I think I will do a separate video with skincare products that I used during my rosacea years and some of them I still use right now another thing that you supposed to avoid with rosacea is sun and heat and I used sunscreen every single day and it didn't improve my situation with rosacea at all another product which I'm sure you've heard of if you have been with Rosa for quite some time already is a magic cream called santra santra is a prescription uh cream which has an active ingredient which is called E vertine and usually doctors say that that is the only rosacea treatment that can actually help you and I had enormous hopes for this cream and they say You're supposed to use it for months before you start seeing results and I've used it every single day I've used it for 3 months for 6 months for 7 months and after 9 months I I understood that I'm not having any results with cantra zero results happened for me with cantra I also tried rosex rosex cream is another prescription cream which has an active ingredient called metronidazol and I've used it at the same time as cantra I used it for 6 months not for 9 months because uh I really felt bad about this cream it is really greasy it is heavy and I felt really really bad while using it I felt like my skin was getting greasy and I felt like my breakouts are even getting bigger and I felt like I was getting more breakouts with this cream so I really didn't like the rosex cream but I kept on using it for six months I used it every night and I used and I use cantra every morning and I didn't get any results with this cre creams also I have done numerous uh blood tests I was testing my health I was trying to find out what's wrong with me I also had a sio test sibo test is a kind of a Brea breathing test uh which is concerning your gut health you are supposed to be prepared for this test like you don't eat anything but chicken with olive oil and drinking water for 2 days which was super complicated and then you're breathing for 4 hours into a special tube and then you get your results uh the full name of this test is a small intestinal bacterial over growth test and well really lots of people don't get perfect perfect results from this test so after taking this test a doctor prescribed me xifaxan xifaxan is a local antibiotic for your gut health and I've been taking xifaxan for about a month and I have seen a little bit of result after taking Caan on my face and I was quite happy about it and I felt like I was on the right track but after stopping cakan everything came back my Rosia came back fully and that was the moment that that I understood that taking antibiotics might actually be a right direction for me and I've researched the topic a lot and what I've read is that in the USA and in Europe there is um medication that is helping with rosacea and it is called orasa or eesh IA here in Europe they have different names in Europe and in the United States I managed to find a doctor who agreed with me that it's a good idea for me to take the direction of taking antibiotics EPA the way it is called here in Europe has an active ingredient of doxy it has 40 milligrams of doxy doxy is quite a strong antibiotic but 40 milligrams is not that much and what you are supposed to do is that you take eia for 3 months every single day and while this might sound scary for you antibiotics for 3 months I would say it was 100% worth it for me and I was so happy that I decided to take it the way you are supposed to take acia is you take it in the morning on an empty stomach and then you wait for 1 hour before you have breakfast that was a good schedule for me I was happy to have an 1 hour of free time before breakfast and I didn't experience any side effects with ephestia at all I felt fine the whole time my God Health was fine the whole time I was taking prebiotics and probiotics during taking aphria and after taking EPA for some time and generally I didn't experience anything bad about this about this about epia and I started seeing the results after one month and a half I started seeing that my breakouts started going away and after finishing acia I had uh like I think like two pimples on my face which was close to nothing I was beyond happy and two months after starting after stopping ecia I had zero break breakouts my face was completely clear and I read a lot online that people often get their Rosa back after stopping EPA or orasa but that didn't happen to me I didn't get any rosacea flare ups or any rosacea breakouts during the last year after I stopped aesia my skin I as I've already said is is far from perfect but I'm so happy with the way it is and I try to stick to a healthy diet I try to eat as many vegetables and fruits as possible although I know I'm far from perfect I eat meat and fish and I drink coffee each day and uh I drink alcohol really rarely but sometimes I do in small quantities I eat sugar and I eat gluten and I eat diary products and that doesn't make my skin feel any worse sometimes I know when I'm eating like a big birthday cake full of cream I know that I might get a tiny pimple the next day but that pimple does not look like the rosacea breakouts that I used to have it looks like you know a tiny little pimple that goes away after one day or two days so that that doesn't resemble rosacea breakouts at all after about 3 months after stopping etia I had three sessions of lumenis M22 treatment it is an IPL therapy intense pulse light therapy they also call it a photofacial and this treatment is supposed to improve your skin color and skin texture and that was exactly what I needed after 10 years of rosacea my skin was a little bit treed in some places the texture was not perfect I had enlarged pores and three sessions of IPL helped me really a lot I don't feel like I need to do any other sessions I don't feel like I need to do anything else to my skin I'm just going to continue with the skincare routine that I have right now and I couldn't be in a happier place than I am right now I really hope that this video was helpful for you please click the like button and subscribe to my channel if this video was useful for you and I sincerely wish you to get better for your rosacea to be cured and for you to get your healthy skin back because I know that that is possible thank you so much for watching and I will see you soon bye",

        "transcript": "feel like i look crazy before i do my skincare routine and also i feel like every time i get out of the shower and have my hair wet i just look like a baby you know there's something very baby-esque about brushing your hair straight back when it's wet but i refuse to brush it any other way [Music] hello everybody my name is maddie i'm a video producer here at hero cosmetics and today i'm going to be taking you through my skincare routine and telling you a little bit about my personal journey with my skin and with my acne let me get you a little close-up because i'm feeling particularly proud of how far my skin has come this is what my skin looks like now a year ago wasn't quite the case i've struggled with my acne my entire life feels like i always had acne when i was younger and i always thought that like if you had acne as a teenager they said that you weren't gonna happen in your 20s and whoever said that's a big fat liar featuring frankie muniz what a great movie anyways i started seeing a dermatologist last summer so some of the products that i'm going to show you and talk about are prescribed to me cleanser that i use being one of them it's a sodium sulfate amide and sulfur cleanser i don't know i have acne rosacea and this is something that i didn't know until i went to my dermatologist is that a lot of the time the acne treatments that people use and that are popular are really not so good if you have rosacea that's great and that's helpful when you're 17 and have acne all over your face and you're like why is it so red so i just started off by washing my face with this if i was doing this at night i would start with an oil-based cleanser and then this cleanser just so i really make sure i get all my makeup off i'll admit this here on this channel and then we're never going to speak about it ever again but when i was in high school i used to sleep with my makeup on i don't know what was wrong with me i had no regard for human life i didn't care and then i could not imagine doing that now i feel like i would just like feel the weight of my foundation on my face myself with my makeup on but in high school i was like oh i shower in the mornings it just like makes more sense to shower my makeup off the next morning was she okay someone needed to help her so next up would usually be toner i really have only been using this at night because i don't really like it this is the ole henriksen dark spot toner it's fine i recently started using it and i don't think my skin loves it from there i go to my favorite part of my skincare routine which is the serums baby serums that i use every day are the hyaluronic acid serum from the ordinary the buffet serum also from the ordinary and the c firma vitamin c serum from drunk elephant i use the hyaluronic acid and buffet serum both morning and night and i just use vitamin c in the morning speaking about sort of my acne throughout my life i always had acne i think the main problem was that i never really was treating it in the way that i should have i was using really harsh cleansers for most of my life which as you can assume being someone who struggles with rosacea probably not the wave probably not the vibe probably not going to be the best thing i've ever done for my skin but i just didn't have like the knowledge about skin care that i do now and i feel like skin care can sound a little overwhelming when you first start learning about it and getting into it so i felt really overwhelmed by it and i never knew anybody who had gone to a dermatologist slash i feel like most of the people i grew up around my family members like they just don't struggle with acne so it wasn't really like any of my friends were struggling with it i mean of course like everyone had a little bit of acne but i feel like most people that i knew it sort of like went away after puberty and my acne was just like we're friends aren't we i think we want to stick around and i was like but maybe you could not at the beginning of last year i was like getting so wildly insecure about my skin i'll insert some pictures of what it looks like but i'd like gone on a vacation and my skin looked like that and then on my birthday my skin looked like that and i was just like ah this sucks like it just feels like such a downer to be like celebrating these good fun moments in your life and have to have pimples all over your face in like the most prominent places it was really bothering me i taken pictures with my sister on the cruise that i won with her and she had posted one for my birthday and when i looked at it i was just like oh because when i posted those pictures i for sure edited all of my pimples off my face and then my sister just posted the raw photo because she's gorgeous so i don't know that really had me thinking too where i was just like ah that really sucks that i feel like i'm so hyper aware of what my skin looks like and i'm so worried about how people are perceiving it and like the people around me just don't have that worry or that care over the last year my skin has like completely transformed and now it's like rare for me to even have a blemish which is good but also sometimes i'm like i really want to make mighty patch content like as a video producer at hero i'm like i really want a zit and a good pimple so i can like make that content get some amazing pimple patch peels but it's like i just don't break out that much anymore so next up i use my creams both of which are prescribed to me from my dermatologist i have rophade for my rosacea and adelic acid which i clearly need a refill on both of these products have done wonders for my skin i feel like more than anything like the acne definitely made me insecure a lot of the time but i also feel like a lot of the time the redness and my acne scars are what made me super insecure because it felt like even when i had clear skin on the off chance i cleared up any acne that i had it still looked like my skin was like irritated and upset and like there was something wrong with it apparently i'm just surrounded by lots of people with perfect skin because i felt like i looked around at everyone else and i was like literally what are you doing what are you doing that i'm not doing and they're like i wash my face with dope soap i'm like i could kill you when i first started going to my dermatologist on top of prescribing some creams to me they also put me on doxycyclin i was on doxycycline for three months the progress was fine i wasn't thrilled with it and then about six months ago i got put on spironolactone now i feel like if anything has done wonders for my skin it's spironolactone i feel like over the last six months is when i've actually started to see change in my skin and it probably helps that i've been home if it was night time from here i would use my tret which is another thing my dermatologist prescribes me that has done wonders for my skin from there we moisturize and this is my absolute favorite moisturizer it's the kiehl's ultra facial cream i have combination skin but i definitely lean more towards having dry skin i started trying out the kyo's ultra facial cream and i love this one it feels very lightweight but also very hydrating here i would use the rescue bomb on whatever area i patched the night before or if i popped anything thank god i don't really have any areas to use that on right now so i just jump right over to applying my sunscreen usually i've been using the glossier invisible shield sunscreen now i'm trying out the first aid beauty weightless liquid mineral sunscreen i really like the glossier sunscreen because it is super lightweight it applies more like a serum and it works great underneath makeup this i've only been using for a week but it seems to have a very similar application except it is tinted but it doesn't apply tinted so i don't i don't really know what's going on here but it seems to be a similar feeling once you apply it so that would normally be a wrap for my morning routine but let me show you what i would normally do at night after my moisturizer i apply my masks i usually either apply my lineage water sleeping mask or my glow recipe watermelon glow sleeping mask i've been using this for like four months i just got this couple weeks ago but i really like both of them and it's just such a luxurious experience to put on a sleeping mask before you go to bed and i i don't know i feel like i always wake up the next morning like ah yeah after that i use the glow recipe avocado melt retinol eye sleeping mask as well as the lineage lip sleeping mask if i could recommend any of these products to you guys honestly it's gonna be this one i love the laneige sleeping mask one of my friends recommended it to me and i got it and it is been worth every single penny in fact i'm gonna put it on right now no more crusties baby none you you have never had a crusty before ever in your life you have the most gorgeous luscious hydrated nourish plump lips ever always and that's your vibe and that's what you're known for i am perplexed by people who comfortably have chapped lips because any time my lips are trapped i feel like i like get that sugar scrub in there get it off get it away from me like i get so my body like tenses up and i can't proceed with my life until i take care of the fact that i have crusty lips i just i'm perplexed by people who just like exist with crusty lips and they're like yep this is fine lip balm last but not least of course i would apply my mighty patches i just love seeing all the colors i definitely use original and dark spots the most slap it on go to bed and like peel off the entire patch the next morning and you have like the clearly defined gunk spot oh it's so satisfying to me like i know that some people find the gunk peels super gross not to me she's very gorgeous to me that is my skincare routine and that's sort of how i got my skin to transform into this after a youth full of pimples and using the most harsh cleansers and exfoliants ever known to man i hope you guys enjoyed this video

        "transcript": "today i'm going to share with you my rosacea story i'm going to tell you about the six stages i went through to totally eradicate my symptoms and if it worked for me then it could work for you too so keep watching because what have you got to lose except perhaps your rosacea [Music] doctors will tell you the cause of rosacea is unknown and that there's no cure they'll also tell you that your only option is to treat your symptoms with medications probably for the rest of your life and they'll also warn you the condition might worsen with age well i'm here to tell you that your doctor's rosacea diagnosis is no medical doctor ever cured rosacea the best they can hope for is to temporarily master symptoms using pharmaceuticals and in some persons these medical interventions can even worsen the condition over time but i'm going to take you down a very different path my journey with rosacea forced me to address all the potential causes of the condition and then to rectify those issues in a logical systematic manner first we need to jump back 15 years to a rather dark period in my life from rosetta first to hold now i'm sure that those of you who suffer from this adult skin condition will understand exactly what i'm about to say next because to put it bluntly rosacea truly is a curse it literally appears out of the blue generally taking hold within a very short period of time and it can absolutely dominate your life destroying your self-confidence in the process nowadays however i'm 100 rosacea free and i never suffer relapses to achieve this i made only a few simple changes in my life nothing difficult nothing expensive anyone can do it and i guarantee that anybody who follows my example will experience positive results so here's my story detailing exactly what i did to permanently eradicate my rosacea back in 2007 when i first noticed my initial rosacea symptoms i just assumed it was mild acne now that in itself was a little confusing because i hadn't had acne since i was a teenager and i was now 47 so i tried using various medicated face wash products and sport creams but they just seem to make things worse causing more redness and drying on my skin so at this point all i'm thinking is what the hell is this on my face and to make things worse at the time i was working as an anti-aging consultant being paid to give health advice to my clients so you can imagine how that must have looked would you take health advice from somebody with a red spotty complexion probably not and we would blame you so i stopped all acne treatments there and then and decided to focus my efforts on identifying the condition and hopefully getting the appropriate treatment well of course it didn't take long to figure out that rosacea was the most likely candidate so i thought great now i know what it is i'll simply get an appointment with my doctor and i'll have my lovely clear skin back in no time but oh how soon that feeling of confidence gets dashed i wonder how many of us have heard that we're following words uttered by our doctor or dermatologist there is no cure you're just going to have to live with it we have medications and creams that can help with your symptoms but you may need to use them for the rest of your life now i don't know about you but my first reaction was to hell with that scenario long-term antibiotics together with the regular use of chemical face creams these are not components that contribute to good health quite the opposite i thought but then reality sinks in and it dawns on you that perhaps you have no option because anything's better than walking around with this red spotty face right at this point in the diagnosis i was experiencing those unavoidable feelings of despair that hit you when you feel so utterly helpless so yes initially i followed the advice of the so-called skin specialist to the letter i took my daily antibiotics and i tried a selection of medicated rosacea face creams and the end result of six months on these meds little to no visible improvement the only thing that appeared to have any positive effect was azelaic acid cream but if i had to put a number on it then i'd say a 10 improvement in most and that dreams things like hell so ultimately all these useless meds were tossed in the bin there had to be a better solution and i was damn well going to find it so here's what i did first i put my work and social life on hold nothing was going to distract me from my goal of once again having clear skin now research was an integral part of my work in life extension so the process of finding and analyzing relevant data was second nature to me i trawl endlessly through research data documenting my findings as i went however it quickly became apparent that something vital was missing from these studies not a single one took a holistic approach to dealing with rosacea it was more a case of let's see what effect therapy a has compared to therapy b compared to placebo so irrespective of whether a study was blind double blind or whatever they were all pretty much focused on finding some magic bullet that would cure the condition that in my opinion is absolutely the wrong approach it certainly hasn't been successful so far so logic dictated that an entirely different way of treating the condition was necessary i deduced if i was going to have any chance of eradicating my rosacea then i was going to have to attack it holistically i decided to focus all my efforts in optimizing my immune system and overall health by systematically addressing every possible factor that might in some way be compromising it and worsening my symptoms now up until this point i consider myself to be extremely healthy and i assumed therefore that my immune function must be close to optimal well time to rethink that one i thought if my immune system was in such good shape then why had i been afflicted with rosacea something had to be amiss and i was going to find it and fix it whatever it took rosacea causes depression there can be no argument about that just ask anyone who's ever suffered from the condition the big problem with this though is that depression suppresses immune function therefore if i was to have any real chance of success it was paramount now i focus on being positive and upbeat this really is key so here's the mindset and attitude that i employed first i accepted that every medical condition has a cause therefore every medical condition must be treatable sure we may not always know what the cause is or the appropriate treatment but simply the fact that we both must exist was all the motivation i needed to see this thing through following a full analysis of my research data i decided that my rosacea treatment protocol was to include six separate interventions and i would only proceed to add the next intervention one science sufficient time to evaluate the results of the previous one that way i'd know exactly which treatment responsible for which benefits firstly i stopped using all skin cleansing products except for a liquid soap antenna for babies it contained no chemicals caused me zero skin irritation and it didn't dry out my skin it's actually still my product of choice to this day and for anyone that might want to try it i've left a link in the description below using only this one cleansing product resulted in a noticeable reduction in redness if i ever felt like my skin needed hydrating then i'd simply apply organic aloe vera gel which proved to be very cooling and caused me no irritation next i stopped all sun exposure now i have to admit this was a hard one for me water sports on the beach had always been an important part of my life but for now at least they were gonna have to be put on hold because anything longer than a couple of minutes in the sun was causing increased facial redness but i should mention that i did take a vitamin d3 supplement in order to compensate for the lack of sun exposure following that i was next forced to address my regular sauna use i'd always been a big fan of the sauna due to its many proven health benefits but i now find myself suffering increased facial redness for several hours following each session so the only option was to knock on the head for now but a little spoiler alert i'm very happy to tell you nowadays i can use a sauna without problems and i can even enjoy sensible sun exposure without skin issues of any kind but more on that later i'd estimate that the overall benefit of these three simple changes was around a 20 improvement although i'd attribute this mainly to less frequent flare-ups as opposed to any major reductions in the symptoms themselves obtaining quality sleep each and every night is quite simply an integral part of achieving optimal health however it's probably the most common factor that most people could improve on and i was no exception before rosacea struck my bedtime would vary between 11 pm to 2 a.m depending on my work schedule or my social plans but i'd always awaken by alarm clock each morning at 7 00 am now i knew from experience that a minimum of seven hours sleep and a maximum of eight seem to provide me with optimal energy levels and mental function throughout the day so here's what i did i immediately set a fixed bedtime of 11 pm but allowed myself to awaken naturally between 6 and 7 am each morning that way i was always sleeping for just as long as my body required sleep quality is without doubt one of the strongest factors influencing both our immune system health and our mental function so i saw this approach as vital it took me less than a week to properly adapt to my new sleep schedule and within the first month i was already feeling and seeing the benefits energy levels had increased and my positive attitude was boosted by a further reduction in symptoms if i had to put a number on it then i'd say another 10 improvement let me also mention that in order to benefit my sleep patterns i use the popular supplement melatonin and for a full explanation regarding how to properly use this supplement and how to optimize your sleep quality then please see my melatonin video elsewhere on this channel next it was time to deal with those nasty little demodex mites now for anyone who hasn't heard of them demodex mites also known as face mites are parasites that live in our face and hair follicles there's two types of dermadex mite and they're both invisible to the naked eye demidex brevis live on the skin and demodex follicularum on hair but here's where i got a shock a little bit of research confirmed that people with rosacea could have up to ten times as many demodex mice on their skin as those without the condition i also learned that the mites become most active in the dark and that they have several stages in their life cycle after meeting on the surface of the skin they apparently go back into it to lay eggs before dying within the skin's layers after death the demidex corpses become liquid and decompose inside the skin when each of these tiny mice dies they release bacteria into the skin and those bacteria trigger an immune response that causes redness and inflammation now one bacteria in particular carried by deminex has been shown to stimulate an immune response in those with rosacea so it seemed pretty obvious to me that deminex must surely be contributing to my symptoms thankfully getting rid of my demonics problem was fairly straightforward a quick search on google revealed that pretty much anyone who's heard of a demodex mite also knows that tea tree oil kills them effectively so i got straight to it i mixed tea tree oil with emu oil in a 50 50 mix for application to my eyebrows and eyelashes and for application to my face and scalp i used a 30 tea tree 70 emu oil mix this ratio caused me no skin sensitivity issues whatsoever now the reason why i chose emu oil as a carrier off for tea tree is because it's non-comedogenic so won't cause clogged pores it's also highly hypoallergenic possesses anti-inflammatory properties and can penetrate deep through the skin's layers allowing it to effectively target demodex brevis every night before bed for seven days straight i applied the appropriate mix of oil to my face scalp eyebrows and eyelashes then in the morning i just showered and washed it off i experienced visible improvements and by the end of the seven day treatment my skin looked noticeably smoother and clearer following that i added five percent tea tree oil to my liquid soap for daily use now this protocol resulted in a further 20 percent improvement in my rosacea symptoms i was definitely making good progress now with a 50 overall improvement so far reports of certain foods causing rosacea flare-ups are commonplace and a quick search on google will provide a list of the most commonly reported problematic foods now at the time i wasn't really aware of consuming anything in particular that exacerbated my own rosacea other than perhaps alcohol which i'd already cut out however i still decided to try as an experiment i selected one food group at a time and totally eliminated that food from my diet for a period of four weeks in order to gauge any improvements but nothing appeared to make any noticeable difference not until this happened i eliminated dairy within three weeks the difference was significant after two months of being dairy free i could finally see light at the end of the tunnel i'd estimate that i was now 80 free of all rosacea symptoms three months into my dairy free experiment i decided to try reintroducing cheese to see what might happen within only a few days mild symptoms were returning which only served to confirm the effect that dairy was having on my condition my dietary strategy of needing to cure rosacea was based on optimizing my nutritional intake in a way that would also optimize my gut microbiome as we now know our microbiome is often referred to as our second brain influencing everything from our thoughts to our immune system health so in addition to carrying out the food group elimination tests i also made sure to avoid all processed foods primarily selecting whole foods in as close to the original form as possible now during this past decade my diet has been leaning towards vegan but i do occasionally still eat meat fish and eggs especially eating out if i were looking to put a label in my dietary practices then i'd probably classify myself as a nutritarian eating to satisfy nutrient requirements above all else nutritional supplements had always been an important part of my personal health program and i always considered a high quality daily multivitamin to be a necessity in order to cover any dietary deficiencies however i was now being forced to look at supplements from a slightly different perspective which supplements in particular would most benefit the appearance of my skin two supplements stood out the first supplement i chose was a peripheral antioxidant called astaxanthin it's a darkly pigmented substance which is produced by a particular type of microbe microalgae and it's the reason why salmon weeds are pink astaxanthin's powerful anti-inflammatory effects can also help calm the inflammation in rosacea and it's been shown to provide a useful degree of uv protection with its natural carotenoid pigments even adding a healthy color to the skin several studies have also shown beneficial effects in relation to wrinkles and skin moisture levels now i noticed the benefits of taking the supplement within a very short period of time and it continues to take it to this day one daily four milligram capsule is all is required and if you'd like to know more about this amazing supplement then you can watch my detailed astaxanthin video elsewhere on this channel the second supplement i chose to take was iodine and here was my reasoning i learned that iodine deficiency in the developed world had increased considerably over the last 40 years and i also noted the apparent steady increase in the rate of rosacea during the same period with the condition now afflicting over 400 million adults worldwide now i knew that iodine was highly important for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland which in turn has a direct influence over the appearance of our skin but what i hadn't been aware of are two reasons why i might be iodine deficient firstly i simply might not be getting enough iodine from my diet and secondly what i was ingesting might be getting blocked by three other elements from the same mineral family those being fluoride bromide and chlorine fluoride is often added to the water supply and it's also a common additive for most toothpaste products bromide is present in pesticides it's often used as a food additive in flower and you can even find it lurking in many personal care products and chlorine well it's present in drinking water swimming pools and jacuzzis now the big problem is this chlorine bromide and fluoride all compete for the same receptors that are used in the thyroid gland to capture iodine ultimately this can inhibit thyroid hormone production with the resultant low thyroid state but here's where it gets really interesting there's actually several other tissues that absorb and utilize iodine and these tissues include the skin so if i did have an iodine deficiency it certainly wasn't going to be benefiting my rosacea condition my solution was to immediately begin supplementing with six milligrams of iodine daily which research indicated was sufficient to ensure that my thyroid and affected tissues had the necessary levels available to function correctly i also made efforts to eliminate exposure to fluoride bromide and chlorine one month into my skin supplement protocol and my condition had continued to improve i'd estimate i was now 90 rosacea free and to be honest if the texture of my skin had just been a little bit better then i've considered myself to have returned to as my pre-rosacea state however i did have one last stage to go and this final stage turned out to be exactly what i needed in order to achieve my goal the final part of my six days protocol was to eliminate any chemical toxins stored within my fat cells we're all exposed to these toxins on a daily basis through the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat even the personal care products we put on our hair and skin the problem is that over time excesses of these toxins can accumulate in our fat cells and they can include such things as endocrine disruptors carcinogens even skin irritants so i figured that irrespective of whether or not they might be affecting my rosacea condition getting rid of them could only be a good thing my research indicated that the one and only truly effective protocol for eliminating chemical toxins stored within human fat cells was a detox developed by dr george ew this protocol was used by rescue workers suffering from toxic chemical inhalation following in 9 11 attacks and it proved to be highly effective shortly after dr you tweaked the protocol for use by the general adult population and is now extremely popular with anti-aging and life extension enthusiasts now initially i was a bit apprehensive about trying this detox because it does require the use of the sauna and the last thing i wanted to experience at this point was a setback however i needn't have worried it now appeared at the extreme heat of the sauna was no longer having any negative effect whatsoever on my rosacea condition quite the opposite in fact with every sauna detox session my skin was becoming closer to 100 percent clear now i'm not going to spend time here describing doctor use detox rather i'll direct you to a detailed video i made in the subject elsewhere on this channel but what i will tell you right now is this the results of this detox with regard to your overall health and the appearance of your skin can be truly transformational to this day i still repeat doctor use sonnet detox once a month in order to prevent any further toxin build up and i still take regular saunas several times a week so that was my sixth stage rosacea protocol in a nutshell to the best of my knowledge those who have tried it have all had worthwhile results and some have even experienced a complete and permanent reversal of their symptoms fast forward to 2022 i'm still 100 rosacea free and have been for the past 12 years it appears that my skin together with those underlying factors that were causing my rosacea have now fully reverted to their pre-rosacea state but the most remarkable change for me is that sunshine saunas alcohol stress even berry appear to no longer pose any threat to my clear skin however i would point out that for health reasons i choose to rarely consume dairy or alcohol the bottom line is this if you want to effectively deal with your rosacea condition then it really does require a totally holistic approach in reality this applies not only to rosacea but to our health in general perhaps if our doctors were better educated in these facts then they wouldn't be so hasty in prescribing medications because there's generally far more effective routes to achieving good health than popping pills i really do wish you the very best of luck in dealing with your rosacea condition and i'd love to hear your comments regarding your progress in dealing with this dramatic affliction the sharing of such information can only serve to benefit us all i'm wrecker black many thanks for watching and if you enjoyed this presentation then please like subscribe and comment it really does help the channel grow and as always take care be healthy and see you again soon [Music]",

        "transcript": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel if you're new here welcome this video is actually viewer requested if you have been following my channel for any length of time you probably know that I have rosacea and sensitive skin I do talk about it and pretty much every skincare video I've ever done I talk about it and a lot of my makeup videos too sometimes a product will cause that rosacea to flare up but I don't think that I've ever talked about the fact that I have battled adult cystic acne as well it's you kind of go hand in hand in many aspects so I wanted to include them in one video as I talk about what's worked for me because if I do things the way I know to do them I don't have rosacea flare-ups I don't ever get cystic acne anymore and I've seen several videos from people where they've kind of discovered largely the same thing so I wanted to share this with you before I get into it though I do want to just give you the disclaimer I am NOT a health care provider it's always best to talk to your physician or your dermatologist before you do anything regarding your health or your skin or anything like that this is just my experience and what has truly worked for me I thought it was only appropriate to do this video without any foundation or powder or anything like that on I basically did my makeup today but without foundation so this is what my skin looks like but again if you've been following my channel at all you've seen me without makeup and sometimes my rosacea is flared up because of a product that I've used and sometimes you can't even tell what works for me may not work for you and what I'm triggered by you may not be triggered by so finding what your causes are for your acne and your rosacea is really important and so this is hopefully gonna be a guide for things to look for that might be causes that I found were causes for me or you know things that may help you you know maybe you don't know what your cause is but they can just help you overall or maybe you do know what your cause is but you just don't know how to fix it so this is just kind of what this is all about I also don't have before-and-after pictures because all of this went on prior to me starting my YouTube channel and when you have skin struggles taking photos about makeup is just not at the top of your want list so I really don't have any before afters to show you what it looks like but if you've ever had a big painful cystic zit you know what that looks like it's not pretty they're very hard to cover they're painful so I'll just go in and tell you a little bit about my experience I'm sure a lot of you can identify with many of these things when I was younger I had beautiful skin I did not have breakouts in my teens it really didn't start until I was in my mid-20s when I started having struggles with just acne in general my mom has always had beautiful skin she has always looked really young for her age so I didn't understand why I was having these issues in my 20s apparently it was hormones at the time so I started seeing a dermatologist then who helped me and of course a lot of that involved cycles of being on and off antibiotics which I just wasn't totally comfortable with but I never really found anything that helped other than this antibiotic cycle and trying different facial creams like retina micro taser AK differ in gel the only one that my skin could really tolerate was different we hadn't identified the rosacea component yet it was probably about mid 30s I went in to get another injection to reduce the swelling in a cystic zit and I asked her about these little bumps on my face I had some redness which is odd for me because I don't have any natural flushing in my skin at all I need blush I'm just one of those people I just am the same skin color on my face but I was having some flushing and I just had these little bumps pimples but they never came to a head and they wouldn't go away I didn't really know what they were and that's when she identified me as having rosacea and I did know what it was because my mom has had it for many years even though she does have beautiful skin but she's been on Metro cream for many years which keeps hers under control basically rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skincare condition that can cause flushing bumps redness pustules and a lot of times it seems like it's acne you don't really realize it's rosacea but it's very frustrating because people try to treat it like acne which then makes it worse it does worsen in things like extreme temperatures by using things like harsh scrubs harsh cleansers a lot of the acne treatments like salicylic acid glycolic acid which is good for anti aging sun exposure there's so many things that people do on a day to day basis like eating spicy foods or drinking coffe that can really exacerbate the rosacea now antibiotics are prescribed for rosacea too when you have a flare-up not because it's a bacterial condition but because antibiotics can help with inflammation so they help decrease that inflammation to get it under control while the cream that you're put on can start doing its work and hopefully that will even everything out so I was put on Phoenicia and given an antibiotic and then that really did start to help me and I was using Phoenicia morning and night and that is a prescription cream for rosacea it contains as a liqu acid and that seemed to work for the most part but I would still have flare-ups and I would still get these cystic painful pimples and I never could figure out what was causing them and I would have to go in periodically and get them injected because they never would go down on their own or I would think they would go down but then we get inflamed again and swell up again so I would go in get an injection it would decrease in size and eventually go away but without getting those injections those bumps could stay around for a month they're notoriously resistant and supposedly anything around your jawline the lower half of your face is supposed to be hormonal so that's what I thought at the time so that's the basic information and the background and my story of what I've dealt with so now I want to tell you what I have identified as being key for me in eliminating or controlling I guess is a better term my rosacea and my cystic adult acne so we can get into that now when you have things going on with your face obviously the first thing you think about is your skincare and how you need to treat it and what you need to put on it and that kind of thing this is one component that definitely makes a difference but it's definitely not the only component and for me it's not the main component but it does make a difference switching to a gentle effective non-stripping cleanser is a huge key component of skin care not this stripping acne control cleansers a lot of times the inclination is to use those acne control cleansers especially if you've got both going on if you've got the Cystic thing and then you've got the rosacea or you see those bumps you want to use something with salicylic acid or something like that in it but salicylic acid can make rosacea flare up also the little scrubby beads can make rosacea worse as well I'm gonna list some cleansers down below that I have used and had great experience with so that you can have some examples of things that can be effective for you at night that gentle cleanser is my second step the first step is removing my makeup before I was just going in a couple of times with the regular cleanser but if you think about it oil attracts oil so if you've got oil and sebum and things in your pores it can really help break down that makeup and get down into the pores better than just a water-based cleanser I think a lot of people think that those oil-based cleansers are gonna break them out and I did too but really they've helped keep my skin clear and nice so using that as a pre step step one cleanse before I go with my regular cleanser really was a huge game-changer for me because not only did it remove my makeup more effectively I really felt like it cleaned up my pores a little bit better and it also allowed my second step cleanse to do a more effective job the second step with skincare is getting on some kind of an anti rosacea treatment whether it be prescription like the Phoenicia as they like acid or one of the Metro creams Metro gels that is ideal I have sent switched to the Ordinaries as a leak acid suspension because my rosacea is pretty much under control I may even be able to drop that because of what we'll talk about in a second they have anti-inflammatory properties and all kinds of things in them that are made just for rosacea skin they're not gonna do the same thing that say a retinol or a retin-a or different or gonna do they have a completely different mechanism of action it's gonna specifically help your rosacea and using one of those morning and night at first is gonna be key and then eventually hopefully things will be under control and you can switch to just night and then eventually you can be hopefully where I am and use it every other night now this is controversial because facial oils are supposed to be bad for rosacea but myself and I've seen a lot of other people say that when they started incorporating a facial oil a good facial oil like rose hit maracuja marula or grapeseed there's tons of different good facial oils that have so many benefits for your skin I've heard of so many people with rosacea saying that genuinely help them just patting a drop or two on the face before you go in with your moisturizer or after your moisturizer it's gonna be a trial and error thing for me it's been huge and it's also helped control my oil production during the day which helps with breakouts using a very gentle basic moisturizer I'll also have some down below is also key not having an active ingredient no retinols anything like that once you get things under control and you really don't have many flare-ups or any flare-ups that's when you can start testing the waters with those retinols and the glycolic acids and things like that you really need to get your problems under control before you start messing around with all those anti-aging things because this is really the area of concern that we're trying to deal with right now SPF is huge for rosacea sun exposure triggers rosacea flare-ups period done so if you're not using a regular SPF of 30 or higher definitely start doing that now and physical SPF is going to be much better than chemical most people with rosacea can't handle the chemical sunscreens you know you go into the drugstore and you see all these sunscreens and they have all the helioplex and the AVO been zoned octa whatever those sunscreens are the ones I know I can't do because they give my skin problems I'm just every time I'll start getting bumps and they'll start flaring out whether it's bumps or redness or both so I personally choose a physical sunscreen for myself if you've been following my channel you know my favorite daily SPF and I'm gonna link that down below but for water and things like that I always go for a baby sunscreen Neutrogena baby sunscreen and a vino baby sunscreen or my two that I use in the summertime if I'm gonna be at the beach or something like that if they're good enough for baby skin and baby skin is so sensitive they're gonna be great for my face and I've always had good experiences with them so that's what I use when I'm going to be on vacation or something like that in terms of lifestyle stress is a huge trigger with rosacea if you can find some way to keep your stress level as low as you possibly can this is gonna be a big thing for your acne and rosacea success whether it's exercising or meditating or just chilling out and reading a book or watching TV something like that where it keeps you nice and even now in terms of exercising that was something for me I always felt like I got very flushed when I exercised and it can cause flare-ups extreme hot and cold temperatures so when I exercise I do need it to be pretty cold in a room or have a fan on me when I'm not completely under control of my rosacea and explain a little bit more in a second about that if I go from extreme hot to cold my face could get really flared up so when I was exercise I would definitely need a fan close by blowing on me or a cold water bottle or something like that so that I wouldn't get too flared up from that hot extreme temperature with the workouts this is a big one that I feel like most dermatologists never talked about never won a tackle I don't know why I feel like I have a pretty darn good dermatologist but for some reason diet never came up never ever ever the last suggestion that we talked about at my last two visits when I kept coming back in to get injected was to be put on a low dose accutane I just did not want to do that I know tons of people do it there was something that I just could not bring myself to do it we talked earlier about the cycle of antibiotics and acne and rosacea and it's a cycle and a lot of times you can become resistant to those antibiotics and they can mess up your gut it in a nutshell your skin is the largest organ that you have it's also an elimination organ and if your gut house is not in check your skin is gonna show it and things are gonna come out through your skin so you really need to take care of everything from not only the outside but from the inside too and this is what I found out to be the key component for me and I've seen this with a ton of people as well so to not bring this up in a rosacea and acne in skin care video you can't really just talk about skincare it has to be about health and gut health to do I ate perfectly all the time no of course not it's not realistic but when I don't I do feel the effects every single time when I either try a product that has something in it that flares me up because I try a ton of products or I eat something that I know is gonna affect me and now I know what my trigger is I said earlier that rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition inflammation in the body is a huge problem and there's certain foods and groups of foods that cause inflammation to just keep building up and keep building up in the body gluten and wheat and refined carbs refined sugars and dairy a lot of people are affected by coffee I'm not I can have coffee every single day it does not affect my rosacea whatsoever I found that when I purged these from my body and ate really healthy basically lean proteins good fats vegetables fruits that kind of thing my skin is perfect I figured out I was eating certain things and my skin and my stomach would be greatly affected by it it caused me to visit my friend who's a gastro to see if I was actually celiac again it was certain foods we did it a lot of testing fructose lactose allergy testing all kinds of things and nothing really showed up and then we did a six-week I think diet called FODMAPs which was hugely beneficial for me in that she'll what FODMAPs is is a several week long elimination diet and you eliminate tons of food groups and then you gradually introduce a food group in mild increments one by one and if you have a reaction then you know you have an intolerance to that food group the last food group that I introduced was wheat and gluten and I had a massive flare-up and stomach issues and all kinds of things so I do have a genuine intolerance to wheat and gluten almost every time I eat gluten or wheat my rosacea flares up or my skin just gets really congested I'm stomach issues and I get except it's really identifying what your particular issue is or just getting rid of the general inflammation in your body mine is localized I know exactly what my problem is most people don't but getting rid of inflammation in your body overall by eliminating what is making you inflamed which you can do by eating better eliminating the refined carbs eliminating refined sugar and eliminating dairy I have not eliminated dairy and I still am able to keep my skin looking good somehow if you find that you are not getting enough of a certain supplement or nutrient supplementing with certain ones like magnesium zinc vitamin A vitamin E fish oil they can really help your skin as well vitamin B can be a problem for a lot of people and cause some skin inflammation and those big under the skin spots I have kind of a problem processing vitamin B so if you're taking that that might be something you want to look at too so that's pretty much the skincare and the lifestyle portion now if you're having some kind of a flare-up obviously you want to cover it the best way you can they have green color correctors out that can help with the redness I'll link some things down below there's also some redness products that can help that are specifically for skin redness it cosmetics makes some redness relief products color science makes a product that you can put on either by itself or underneath makeup that helps with redness mineral makeup is a great thing to wear concealing while allowing your skin to be able to breathe is key you just don't want to be clogging everything up finding things that are good for sensitive skin foundations for sensitive skin and again I'll link some product options down below because if you do have some redness or some bumps going on you do want to be able to cover them in an effective way I do understand that I have struggled with that myself let me know if you'd be interested in a top 5 foundations for sensitive skin and maybe primers as well and I can share with you what's worked for me and again one does not suit all but I can really share with you my top products that I like for my sensitive skin these are things again that one size does not fit all but hopefully they might give you some ideas or help you identify what your cause might be or what might help you if you've been struggling with either adult cystic acne or rosacea thank you so much for watching if you have questions or just want to vent about your problems because I know it's such an issue and it's such a struggle it could be embarrassing and you just don't want to show your skin I completely understand my skin has not always been clear I've struggled too so if you want to vent about that leave your comments down below I

        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry a family physician and in this short video let's talk about the rosacea diet and how to reverse the redness associated with rosacea the redness the scaling the blood vessels are embarrassing over 400 million people on the planet suffer from rosacea and I have a secret to tell you later in this video that you might not believe what if I told you that the cause of your rosacea is not some of the triggers you've been told about but it's actually your diet it's what you've been eating and it's what you've not been eating that's what's causing your rosacea that's what this video is all about now if you know someone suffering from rosacea please take a second and share this video with them so that they will know there is hope and there is a solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at the end of this video watch that playlist and learn how to do Kido right Kido is cheap Kido is easy Kido is very safe very natural it's very nutritious and it's very delicious and it's going to help your rosacea get better than you ever dreamed it would be and then you can save your money that you've been wasting on co-pays with the pills and the gels and the creams and the lotions because you won't need those anymore now everyone who's already reversed their rosacea with a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet I need you to do me a favor in the comments below I need you to tell your story because there'll be people watching this video who will absolutely think I'm kooky and won't believe what I'm saying if you're a newbie to this if you're like there's no way you can reverse my rosacea with changing my diet read the comments below you'll see hundreds and hundreds of people who used to have severe rosacea who now take it use no medication for the rosacea it happened for me it

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": "hello to say it's been a hot minute is a drastic understatement but what I'm glad to report is that my skin is clear my rosacea people say it's incurable I don't care I never believed it I never wanted to believe it so I kept searching for me it's been since 2016 and it's now 2023. it's about time I would say and in this video I want to share with you uh the things that have really helped me have changed and revolutionized my skin I spent a long time believing that it was difficult to heal and that the more pain I put myself through the stretch of the regimen the more likely it was that I was doing the right thing and that I would get better that was never the case and I've had times where I feel like I've healed and then I've backtracked I got mold poisoning and everything came back even with a Vengeance I became you know having reactions to all types of food when I had made so much progress before and I just thought when is enough enough and it was actually last year in August when I got I was before August it was in June last year when I got covered and I got significantly worse again everything got re-triggered and activated and I was just fed up and you know in those moments where you go nut enough is enough what I'm doing is not working it has gotten me this far it's not getting me any further and you hit this like roadblock and it's so frustrating and you just want to cry and you're overwhelmed I hit that point back in June 2022 and I turned around and went I'm doing it differently so I met this friend through my blog in the raw and I had helped her with her rosacea journey and she came back around and swung back around and helped me with my rosacea Journey now her recommendation to me was to try particular products this is not a sponsored ad I have nothing to do with anything I would never do that um but I'm just going to share with you what worked because I think I owe it to you and I've I've recommended it to multiple different people and the results that they've had has just been amazing uh because it works and all of a sudden what I found in my health Journey was that it went from being super difficult to being very clear this is getting rid of the cause I don't have to like starve myself and worry about everything being just so otherwise I'm going to have this awful reaction which is what it was all of a sudden I'm getting better and better and I can eat I was so happy and it was such a relief because every day my skin is getting consistently better consistently better consistently better and it's just like for the first time it's not get a bit better get a little bit worse get a bit better get a little bit worse and just like this journey of just uncertainty and like is it this is it that enough you know we have to deal with enough things that we shouldn't be having to worry you know constantly about what we eat about changing our pillow every five minutes about worrying about touching our face and just all these like finicky things that we we obsess over when we have such severe issues we think oh if we do all these miniature things like then my skin will be okay as if it's your fault that your skin is not okay that you are doing something fundamentally wrong well sometimes it's about finding the root of how it occurred and allowing yourself to enjoy life and ease into the things that you want to ease into um so this is what these products did for me and oh I should probably show you what they are I didn't organize that very well this is a bit impromptu so the products that I started using were recommended by my friend who also had a severe formal rosacea very similar presentation to mine we have very different Journeys but very similar presentation and I was super skeptical at first I was I it actually she recommended to me nine months earlier and I kept thinking to myself I wish I tried this earlier uh but who cares it was perfect timing that's just the same it was perfect timing so I tie the products I but before I did I start going no like I just nosedive into all of this person's content he was originally a doctor dermatologist who got sick of the fact that the typical way that Dermatology functions the options are laser antibiotics or anti-inflammatories all of which can cause a lot of damage and for many of you I know because I speak to so many people around the world their rosacea got significantly worse after taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatories because it exacerbates the underlying cause now controversial thing to say but I'm going to say it so he started questioning that and started formulating uh and researching to what might work and rosacea is such a complex skin condition it seems to be one of the most difficult skin conditions and the one that doctors seem to believe cannot be eradicated cannot be reversed but I have reversed the vast majority of my allergies before I get to the solution I just want to share with you something so exciting for the past three weeks I have been eating gluten I've been eating all these things that I normally would be like I'm never eating that again it's so bad for you um and just enjoying food and just loving life um so uh and I still listen to my body anyway the point is let's get to the product so I started using and researching and deep diving into a product called as osmosis or a brand called osmosis I began with their rescue serum uh which helped with my dry painful red and flaky skin it was so painful and so red I'll show you before and afters um I mean you can see the after but the befores of when I start before I started using these products it's just crazy like the inflammation not just the redness and the bumps I had like a nose bump like this but also the puffiness of my eyes the swelling of my cheeks like I also had like a double chin um even though I'm the same size so I was just overall really inflamed and swollen and that's because it's autoimmune issues now I thought on the rescue and immediately I felt insane relief like previously I had been putting on so much Derma vigils like just slapping on the lipids just to try and almost like a Vaseline just like trying to cover my um my barrier so that it would not be leaking moisture all the time because it was so itchy and so sore I was applying it multiple times a day I couldn't go anywhere without it I would never ever dream of you know not cleansing my face or going through my routine if I woke up I immediately had to go to the bathroom and wash my face because I was in agony always when I wake up when I go to bed now sometimes I forget to wash my face I actually don't know who I am anymore I'm pretty good though like it's it's not a regular occurrence but that's the level I don't it it's not like an everyday Obsession because it's not painful it's it's livable I mean it's pretty good so okay rescue fantastic product it's a DNA Repair Serum it helps to heal scars does all these things for collagen look it up um I'll probably put some links below uh so that you can have a little bit of a look-see but Dr Ben Johnson has so much so many YouTube videos online I'll tell you all the other things that I also used as well so I started with rescue and I also started with regenerate which was a liver it's meant to help regenerate the liver and help the liver so Dr Ben's theory is that with rosacea it's either liver induced or it's candida introduced and he has things on the website to determine what that is you can also email him uh and I'll put his email down below you can email him personally and he will respond to you um for free so that's really generous um it's getting harder and harder for him to do it within you know a week or so but it's worth it regenerate he told me I needed to go on it for nine months I hit the nine month Mark I think a month ago um and now I'm off all the internal products and my skin stays consistently really good it's improving all the time every month and so regenerate was the second one I also after I started doing the regenerate I was making a lot of progress but I wasn't making it's like I was making progress in some areas of my skin and not in other areas and when I sent some photos to Dr Ben he said you also have candida rosacea so I went on his candida protocol as well as the liver protocol and I started as I was detoxing my skin that's why I started with the rescue because it helps detox as well detox and heal after I started with the rescue I started adding other elements into my regimen but if it was causing the detox to happen too strongly I would pair back and wait I think it took me three months before I could go on some of these other repair serums I went on stem factor which helps with like collagen and scarring and then I also wanted to try Catalyst Ace 11. once you start learning about all these incredible products and what they do for your skin it's like I want to try I want to try but you have to slow down and so I now have implemented I've got stem Factor rescue the um correct serum I started off with calm which is better for rosacea skin you start off with calm and then uh Catalyst ac11 every now and again um and that's really good for elasticity and it's just all of it helps with different things for the skin especially when you're doing repair like I've had almost what seven years of skin damage and breakage to make up for so my skin is loving it the first thing I realized when I put this topical stuff on my skin was oh it's fading my skin my my skin feels fed uh so that was really great and then um yeah so you can look up what his candida protocol is it's um something called uh you take these capsules called clarify it helps you clear out mucus which apparently is what candida different types of candida feeds off and then you take this like spray Elixir thing which helps reduce the population of the candida so I did that for three months and noticed significant effects and then I just continued to improve as I continue to take regenerate and I also took his fat supplement which I forget the name of at this point in time uh that one's really amazing as well I took that for three months because I in the past had really bad I just I just didn't have enough natural oils and lipids in my skin um that's also something that could help aid your skin as well as not having enough oils because I wasn't absorbing it because my liver wasn't functioning properly so I wasn't absorbing fat and I've noticed like I used to have a lot of pulling like my skin was pulling and tight because it didn't have enough lipids and fats and I've done you know a lot of skin scans now and the pulling is no longer there so my skin is now like having this vibrant lipid look the youthful look or whatever I know I'm younger whatever I did have like all these what appeared to be like all these Fine Lines because my skin was so dry I would highly recommend giving it a go emailing Dr Ben again this isn't sponsored but I just wanted to give you guys an update because I want more people to know about what works and at the end of the day it's all about having a better relationship with your body learning to love yourself more and living the most vibrant life you can so you can start giving to others one of the things that I struggle with the most and I think we do struggle with in self-esteem when your skin severely affects your life especially with more severe skin conditions or ones that are autoimmune related they really significantly can impact your life and it impacts your ability to contribute to the world to actualize yourself to Greater to Greater degrees it might affect travel it might affect the activities you participate in it may affect the you know the confidence level of you to be able to make contacts and friends and further yourself and your career it might reduce your ability to earn and therefore give back to society maybe you want to make more contributions to Charities causes all these things like it affects every area of your life and people don't realize the significant impact and so that's why I'm sharing this with you because I feel like the past nine months of my life 10 months I think it's 10 or 11 months now I can't even count anymore I've just lost track have been transformed because of this so let me know how you go let me know your thoughts let me know if you've tried it before and yeah I would love to see how it helps you and if you tried it as a result of watching this video anyway lots of love to you and um good luck on your skin Journey",

        "transcript": "hello my amazing friends I hope you guys are doing super well today my name is makenzie and I'm so happy that you're here today I am coming with a video to you guys talking all about my skin and my skin journey because I know we all sometimes have skin issues unless some of you are the lucky few that don't have any skin issues like my boyfriend's he has perfect skin and he does nothing to his skin so yes maybe you guys are some of the lucky ones but if you're like me and you've been struggling with it you're not alone and I'm here for you and I just want to share with you guys my journey because it's been quite a journey so I actually wanted to make one long video I'm talking about my skincare journey and then my products but it just was so long that it just was getting to be too much like I was going borderline like 45 minutes so I just thought okay I'll just I'll just do a couple videos and share with you guys my story and then also the skincare products so today is going to be all about the journey so without further ado let's get started it's actually really cool that I was filming YouTube videos during this whole time because you can see where my skin was like super good and then you could see where it started to slowly get worse so it was about February 2017 where I started to get little pimples and I'm 27 years old now and at that time I had just turned 24 so I was very weird it was super strange that I was getting little pimples on my face I just thought okay this is like really weird I'm not a teenager anymore I had usually pretty good skin I mean when I was a teen I had some hormonal acne but it definitely was not as bad as like little pimples on my cheeks like I just never had that so it was super weird and I was thinking oh maybe it's mold in my apartment maybe it's stress cuz you know 2017 and 2018 was a pretty stressful stressful time for me so uh yeah I just was thinking oh maybe it's that you know it'll clear up it's fine um but it slowly started getting worse I just started getting more pimples I think it was on this cheek it just started kind of like coming up and it just wouldn't go away like they just stayed for forever it felt like anyway yeah they just wouldn't they wouldn't go away and it just started at first I was like okay maybe this is just something that's you know it's just stressful period but when I noticed that it just was continuing to stay yeah it started to worry me a little bit it wasn't ever that bad at that time but I just started to notice how it was sort of affecting me and how I felt like like I just I look like I am NOT taking care of my skin that's like what it started to look like and this is before it got really really bad and you know I had gone through a stressful period in my job at that time and then I had been in Hawaii for a couple months I did notice that it was also not really improving when the stress was going away when I was relaxing a lot and you know people told me lay in the Sun it'll dry out your acne like yous acne products like you you know use salicylic acid like I just I I was getting so much advice from all over the place and I didn't know what was the right thing for me so it just slowly progressively got worse and then I started traveling in Italy where it was pretty okay but actually started clearing up a bit and I was also eating a lot of vegan food as I was going along so I was staying with friends who were vegan so and I noticed that my skin was clearing up I was feeling very happy very joyful I had then moved to Berlin and I was meeting all these new people and going out all the time and it was so much fun so my skin was clearing up a little bit at that time I did have some pimples here and there you can see in some of the videos that I was filming I also had very long hair so I would just like put my hair this so you couldn't really like see the the pimples and yeah that was that was one of my ways of like hiding it on YouTube so it's actually it kind of funny um I then met my current boyfriend beer and then it was just so much fun with him he wanted to go out all the time and go to parties and meet lots of new people and have German beers and beer cartons and then summer came and we were just like living the high life the whole summer traveling going all over the place and then my skin got really really bad like it was to a point where I just started having these like horrible little pustules just coming up all along here all along here my forehead was always pretty okay but yeah it was mainly like in this sort of region here on my nose a little bit and like this sort of area was very irritated and very red and yeah I just was not taking care of it I was in the Sun all the time especially during the summer it just was like I was always in the Sun drinking beers having a good time not wearing sunscreen like you know going home late not washing my makeup off my face like it just was very it was everything auntie which I could have done before but now that my skin was starting to become more sensitive it just couldn't handle it anymore so I started to become concerned because it was starting to look very very bad and I just didn't know what to do anymore I just was like okay so let's start taking care of it so what I ended up doing was I started you know washing my face I started to adopt some better habits washing my face twice a day and using moisturizers and I noticed that it still like wasn't going away so for me usually once I start taking care of my skin then it just would get better but it just would stop going away and I I noticed that it was characteristically in this area here and it was very very red and it wasn't my typical like pustules like AK acne pustules it was like very irritated spots and I also noticed I had a lot of like broken blood vessels here if you looked like very closely so under all the redness and irritation and little irritated spots there was a lot of broken blood vessels so yeah I just remember being like okay I don't know what this is I don't think it's regular acne because I'm not a teenager it's not in the hormonal areas it's in this like interesting place just there everywhere else is fine and I noticed my triggers son and drinking and any like rubbing or anything like that like using a makeup wipe to take off my makeup was making it irritated so I started to educate myself a little bit more and I started googling like okay I'm adult I'm an adult and I'm getting these very red spots and they're not like regular pimples and these are my triggers and of course like google is not always the best place to be looking but it started to come up with rosacea and I thought okay this is very interesting because it's not going away I'm starting to take a better care of my skin things like salicylic acid like I bought like la roche-posay effaclar like all these things that I thought were gonna make my skin better we're actually making it way worse so I just thought okay like maybe it's this rosacea so I started getting like rosacea products so I used the eminence organics like calm skin care line and what that actually did was I actually started to make it better my skin looked great like the redness went away but then what happened was I think I was in Mexico at the time of my family for Christmas and I was in the Sun a lot and I had a huge flare-up and I think what happened was that I had a big flare up and then I covered it covered my face with all of this stuff that was like this really thick like moisturizer and thick cleansers and I think what it did is just sealed all of the the bacteria and I know I keep like going like this also because they don't want to touch my face so I was just like but yeah I think it just like sealed all the bacteria into my skin so then little pustules started coming up and it looked like a combination of acne and a combination of rosacea so at that time I was pretty sure that I had rosacea but I wasn't sure why the rosacea products were not clearing up my skin so it just continuously like it's just like every month a new pitbull showed up every month a new flare-up came and every month I had a new scar a new start spot on my face and so it just started to accumulate and it just started to look very not taken care of I felt like I looked older like I just I just really noticed it just did not it just my skin just was not healthy and there was something that he needed to change so actually I had come to Amsterdam to start looking for work when my boyfriend decided to move from Berlin and I was like I can't do this on my own anymore I need some help so I went to an aesthetician and she was very very helpful here in Amsterdam she said you know let's do some chemical peels let's get rid of this bacteria and she taught me some some things that I needed to know like don't touch your face like I had knew these I had known these things before but yeah I just I just did I kind of ignore them don't touch your face like don't use like a washcloth like cleanse well always wash your hands before you touch your face and change your pillowcases like all these things and also she said the heat is really really tough so just try and take like don't be in the Sun and try and just like keep your skin cool because that was another thing I just noticed like the heat was just making it worse and I had noticed that the previous summers wear as well like it just was not doing well and and you're up here they don't really have air conditioning so it just was like heat all the time so I think maybe that was also little bit of a contributing factor but anyway so yeah so I signed up for four chemical peels with her and it was really great because she was able to be gentle with my skin and it all cleaned out and then also we would clean it out and then she would do the peel to take like another layer skin off and then she would use um I don't know it's like Oh infrared light or something that killed the bacteria so I noticed that the actual like bacterial bacterial pimples went away like they totally went away and yes that was amazing and I was so happy about that and that was when I started to notice like even more so how many broken red blood red blood vessels I had on my on my cheeks so that was what I really was like I think I have rosacea but I think I just have incredibly sensitive skin to the point where like being out in the Sun at all is gonna cause a flare up drinking amounts of alcohol consecutive days in a row it's not good for my skin also I was in Berlin for a year and a half or so and everywhere that I went there was always like cigarette smoke everywhere and I'm also pretty sure that was a contributing factor so yes it just was like okay I just need to deal with this now because the acnes away I know I need to wash my hands every time I know that I need to use products that are very sensitive so I got some products that were just like super for super simple sensitive skin like super simple and that's just what I did I just left it at that I just had a cleanser and an AM and Apia moisturizer and the am had sunscreen in it and then the PM oyster Iser and that was all and that was when I started to notice my skin was clearing up and yes so now I have some more products that I use but for the most part I rarely ever get any pimples I did go to the doctor and get a prescription for rosacea so they did diagnosed me with rosacea and they did me that rosacea it can look like acne so I think I just had a combination of the two but yeah my skin is now almost totally clear I think I have like one here because I went exercising with makeup on yesterday so that was really not a good idea but now it's like I it's more in control whereas before it just it just couldn't yeah I don't know I just couldn't get ahold of it it just was it was really not nice and I don't I also don't know maybe it was also the water in Berlin because I'm in Amsterdam so I I moved from Berlin to Amsterdam and now Amsterdam like I don't notice any problems like nothing's really coming back like occasionally I'll get like a little spot on my cheek and then it goes away so yeah I don't know maybe maybe that's part of it like yeah and I did hear that water is a bit harder and like there's more minerals and in Berlin in the water so I don't know it could be that so again if you guys are struggling with any skincare just know that like you're not alone and also it doesn't mean them it's gonna last forever I think just learning about your skin learning what your triggers are and also you know I I didn't take any medication but if that's something that you hear from your doctor or a doctor or multiple doctors then maybe it's it is time to take some medication I did hear from Mike because I I went to two doctors and the esthetician and they did tell me like the doctor previously did tell me to go on accutane and then this doctor now she said that accutane wouldn't have helped so I think it's really also important to make sure you get a proper diagnosis of what is going on with your skin looking back I for sure have rosacea like I'm actually a bit sad that it wasn't caught earlier but now we know and now everything's been working out really well and I feel like you know I can wake up and I so scars and everything like that so if you are suffering with any skin issues just know you're not alone and I think you're beautiful in your own way and who cares if anybody is saying anything about it because I had people commenting on my skin and I and I know how hurtful it is so I can completely relate so let me know in the comments if you guys have any questions I'm going to be filming another video all about my products so I'm very excited to share that with you guys and yeah if you have any questions please leave in the comments below I am always here for you so if you even need to talk about any skin issues or anything else as well like I'm always happy to to talk so anyways I love you guys so much don't forget to subscribe and give me a thumbs up and I

        "transcript": "I'm someone who has experienced rosacea all my life but I also make up a lot of people with rosacea in my experience it's been so bad sometimes that it's really affected my self-esteem other times I can it's absolutely fine and my Skin's great I think as a GP I see firsthand just how distressing it can be to have facial flushing and the spots and so on that are so obvious and often at a time of life when people are expecting to have gone past spots I've done the makeup so that it is really realistic and this is kind of the rosacea that I would get at its very very worst from dermatologist point of view I think one of the main challenges that this condition is underrecognized so people suffer but don't see medical attention or they suffer and when we come to GP and GP sometimes don't know what's happening I think this campaign for me is really important because what it's really saying is you're not on your own uh you don't have to put up with it often it can be really easily treated but you do need to come and tell us about it so your GP wants to know that's what really resonated uh with me about today is the fact that rosace is one of those conditions that's so um misunderstood but it impacts people's confidence in such a negative way you don't know how people perceive you but what we do know is that are all judged on our appearance in a really short period of time yeah it's it's that quick snap decision what we make about people isn't it and I think if you're red you look like you're not in control you're not calm do you know what rosacea is no I don't okay any idea no okay never heard of it no I never heard of it have you ever heard of a skin condition called rosacea no have you ever seen anybody walking down the street with a very red flushed face uh yes yeah and what might you think that was if you saw something like that would you look would eczema the strangest thing about the process today I think was probably going into a bar because when you go out in the evening to have a drink it's part of the process that you put on make up you want to look your best you have a great outfit um I think that going into bar with a really really red face and knowing that everybody was looking at me even if they weren't looking at me thinking that they were looking at me made me feel a little bit more embarrassed I don't know if I judg them but I think I would I would definitely look at them and wonder what it was uh but I think I judge them though with rosacea you do presume that they've been drinking so it took off the makeup I did my makeup as I nor normally would and I definitely feel better I definitely feel more like me I think today was a really great experience what interested me most was that the majority of people who looked at my face their reaction was you've had a reaction to some sort of chemical you've had a reaction to some sort of skin care or to makeup um or maybe your sunburnt not one single person said oh you look like you've got Ros so that tells me that we need to know more about rosacea I would say that the majority of people who have rosacea don't know that they have rosacea and they could be treating it and they could they may not have to live with it anymore I don't really know an awful lot about it but I have heard of it as a skin complaint okay any ideas what it might be um I really wouldn't be able to guess I mean sometimes NE disease can come from someone who's discovered it or someone who first had it so I don't know but educate [Music] me",

        "transcript": "are you struggling with facial redness postural spots or just irritated skin keep watching to learn a holistic approach to rosacea on its treatment in today's video if you're new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret known may be considered it's a powerful retinoid medication that's often used to treat severe acne but it can also be effective in treating rosacea it's only prescribed in specialist centers if you have difficulty accessing and appropriately qualified medical professional there are online Dermatology Services who can assess your skin where you upload photographs and describe your symptoms a dermatologist then assesses your individual case and prepares a personalized blend of topical treatments suitable for your condition and your skin type I use dermatica for my own personalized night

Healthcare professional don't let rosacea hold you back you deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your skin now if you found this video helpful watch this short video on how we can start start

        "transcript": "April is rosacea awareness a month and for those of you who know me in the channel you know that I've posted a lot about my struggles with rosacea some of the products that I've used to help overcome it and I say overcome it kind of loosely um I've come to terms with it I recognize what my triggers are I understand better how to maintain My Skin Barrier and most importantly focus on the treatments and medications that give me the best outcome for my skin I will say rosacea is definitely a marathon and not a Sprint as is most things with skin care there's rarely an overnight success or magic treatment that's gonna solve all your skin issues no matter what they are but certainly that's the case with rosacea at least that's been my experience while I have my rosacea pretty much under control I still have flare-ups I still have irritation I still kind of regress backwards so I just wanted to kind of sit back relax and do a little bit of an update video for you on how my rosacea my skin is doing now and what I attribute My Success to my skin in at its lowest point look like this but you can see now I specifically for today's video I'm not wearing any foundation BB cream CC cream I chose a tinted mineral sunscreen it's really new to me it was sent to me in PR it's naked Sunday's tinted mineral sunscreen I like the tinted mineral sunscreens of course because they offset the white cast overall my skin is just so much better than it was not to say that I don't still have flare-ups I do especially when I ignore my triggers which I know full well what they are red wine which sucks because I love red wine spicy foods also sucks I love spicy foods and my husband likes to cook spicy foods so yeah sometimes I have to suffer through the aftermath with my skin and the sun it's very hard to avoid the Sun but I do my best to mitigate that so I will wear a hat when I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time and I always always wear a daily sunscreen my view on sunscreen is honestly just find one you love and you use that speaking of setbacks recently I was traveling staying in a hotel room you know the air is different in the hotel room I was drinking red wine with dinner the climate was slightly different you can see on my face here how my rosacea flares and it's almost immediately so as much as I try to control my triggers and set the situation to be optimal for Success it still happens I'll tell you what I did in my story and hopefully you can just extrapolate from that something that may be useful for you of course you should be in consultation with a medical professional I'm not that I'm simply here to share with you my story and my experience so that hopefully it can arm you with some more information and help you along the way if nothing else to know you're not alone the Hallmarks on my rosacea is an impaired barrier Associated redness and flushing irritation inflammation and pimples back when it was at its worst this is what I did I stopped everything in my skincare routine basically put myself on a skincare diet I I went back to the very basics of cleansing and moisturizing my skin and when it comes to Cleansing just choose a cleanser that's very gentle and hydrating that's what worked for me I've used this Cetaphil Vana cream was one of my favorites uh this one by avino continues to be one of my favorites it's their common restore line and I wanted to call out this one this is the glucoside foaming cleanser and while this is a new launch from the ordinary I've been really enjoying this product for my skin my children have been using it too and they also have very sensitive skin it was tested on babies originally and it's just been a really lovely cleanser so back then when I was at my worst I wish I would have had something like this too I've also used cerave's hydrating cleanser it's really just about finding the one that works best for you within your price point I only cleanse my skin at night with a cleanser in the morning I use water only this is one of the ways I was able to keep my barrier intact the cleansing process just seemed to be too much for my skin if I was doing it morning and night so that was really a game changer for me for moisturizers I like to offer something that's rich in ceramides and that is a little bit occlusive to lock that moisture into the skin because one of the Hallmarks of rosacea is a damaged Skin Barrier it has trouble holding and retaining that moisture into the skin so if you can do that with your moisturizer you're ahead of the game so cerave's moisturizing lotion is a great one love regimen Labs cream this is their second iteration of this particular product they've actually improved the consistency and the applicability of this on the skin it's far less thick and more spreadable I'd say on the skin and this one's fabulous because it has ceramides as does the CeraVe one it's a higher price point for this but I just really love this brand for a gel type moisturizer going back to Aveeno this common restore line has just been really good for my skin I love this it's drugstore so it's readily accessible and great for my combination skin sometimes I don't want a thick Rich moisturizer this can be great in the morning and a thicker richer cream in the evening is sometimes what I opt for but another new launch from the ordinary they've improved or added to their natural moisturizing factors line and this one is their natural moisturizing factors plus phytoceramides so again just adding more ceramides into the formulation making this a really good moisturizer for rosacea in my opinion and also for those of you with dry skin when it comes to daily sunscreen my opinion just find one that works for you whether it's chemical mineral hybrid whatever it is tinted non-tinted cheap expensive if you're gonna put it on your face every day go with that one I'm being facetious because sometimes sunscreen can be irritating to some and you want to find the one that best suits your skin I've actually created a shop my which really lists the products that are my favorites by category those are affiliate links so you don't have to purchase through through those just look at what the products are and then you can Google and purchase on your own because otherwise I make a very small commission if you purchase from those links so if you want to great and thank you if you don't totally fine as well but the point is to be able to share with you what my favorites are by genre so I'll link my favorites below for my sunscreen category so you can take a look through there ask me specific questions in the comments if you have about any particular product all of the ones that are listed there are ones that have worked for my skin so I hope you find that helpful I did want to call it this product that came to me in PR this is by Dr jard it's your secret pair tiger grass Camp drops they're really neat and it's green looks kind of gross but if you know the color wheel green offsets or neutralizes red now this is an SPF 35 but I actually use this kind of more like makeup and then it's just giving me that additional sun protection so I apply whatever sunscreen I'm wearing wearing for the day and then I put a few drops of this over top and it really neutralizes the red so I'm kind of almost using it like makeup as opposed to sunscreen but definitely impressed with this product for me Beyond getting a basic skincare routine in place and focusing on restoring and repairing My Skin Barrier without adding in any active ingredients like retinoids and vitamin Cs and acids and all that stuff just keeping it to the basics I also needed medical intervention so at the time I was prescribed this which is metrogel this is an antibiotic gel often used for people who struggle with rosacea I can say that this was definitely responsible for getting my rosacea under control in that kind of acute flare-up phase that I was in once My Skin Barrier was intact and things were calmed down settled down that's when I could reintroduce the active ingredients into my skincare routine such as my vitamin C retinoids Etc so just because I have rosacea doesn't mean that I can't capitalize on those things it's just sometimes I have to opt for versions that are more sensitive skin friendly and when I have a flare-up I kind of revert back to the basics again just to be sure my Skin's under control before I reintroduce those active ingredients in my skincare routines the next thing and it's no surprise for those of you who have watched my channel for a while it's the thing that I actually attribute my kind of ongoing success with my rosacea is azelic acid I feel like it is really responsible for keeping my rosacea obey and maintaining My Skin Barrier overall I have used over-the-counter acelaic acid serums for years and I can say some of my favorites are Paula's Choice 10 azoleic acid booster and this one by theramid it's their acid or azid I'm not sure how it's pronounced but this one's at 15 azaleaic acid I was impressed with this one because it's actually the same percentage of azelic acid as my prescription and strength osoletic acid and I fairly recently started this prescription phenacea finessia tomato tomato I'm not sure but it's a 15 prescription only here in Canada as oleic acid now the different approach I've had with this one versus the other ones is that I was normally using those once a day generally in my morning skincare routine paired with my vitamin C but I've been using this one now for about six weeks twice a day morning and evening skincare routine it's another reason I love this as a product azelic acid it pairs well with so many other things it really doesn't have conflicts you don't have to worry about it I use it in my evening skincare routine paired with my retinoid in my morning skincare routine pair with my vitamin C the only thing I don't do is I don't put it in the same routine as my acid day when I use my aha or Alpha hydroxy acid it's once a week and I just focus on the acid and hydrating skin care products to surround that routine I'm only six weeks into this sort of regime so I will definitely do an update for you later on but already I am reaping the benefits of this overall I can feel that my skin is just more calm and healthy azelic acid has so many health benefits for the skin especially for rosacea it works to decrease the swelling the associated redness but is really effective at targeting the bacteria that's in the pores that can also contribute to the pimples associated with rosacea making this also a great product or great ingredient for those of you with acne prone skin of course there can be Associated side effects I think primarily those are tingling stinging and even drawing of the skin I personally haven't had that experience so I'd love to hear from those of you who perhaps have had that experience you can share that in the comments section below but certainly if you're using a prescription nasolic acid you'd be in consultation with a medical professional and of course they'd be able to talk to you more about that but if you're using OTC or over-the-counter azoleic acids just be aware you're experiencing that as well I will continue to monitor my rosacea with you and I'll do more updates as we go along and just see how my journey goes because I'm hoping it's helping you to understand more about the disease and spreading awareness which is what the April rosacea awareness month is all about I'll drop some information on that in particular below I would really really love it if you would share your thoughts experiences comments in the comments section below if you haven't watched them already be sure to watch these videos up on screen and I hope you have a fabulous day",

        "transcript": "hi there guys and welcome back to naturally Rossum today I want to tell you my rosacea story how I got it and how I heal it finally so let's get started so first of all what is rosacea rosacea is kind of a skin rash like eczema or acne but you only get it in the face and only around your eyebrows and under knows that it's that's where it hit me the most and I always looked like a clown because everything was red like when you're sweating and your face turns red and puffy this is how it looked even if I didn't sweat so but yeah rosacea is a skin rash and it actually stems from a strep infection and that totally makes sense to me because strep also causes other symptoms which I pretty much all of them had first of all I got sighs this is how I how it started for me and every I had him in the upper lid in the tower lid and yeah frequently once they started they kind of spread out like a wildfire and then after one month or so the skin were started and what I also had before and which is also scrap related is Candida vaginosis well which is yeah what I got even way back before I started eating raw foods and since I started eating raw foods it got better and I did not get it that frequently even though I'd still got it from time to time but that's another story so back to the strap it also effects the intestinal tract and can cause things like SIBO and irritable bowel syndrome and yeah my digestion was never very good and only got better once I switched to raw foods and yeah so how did it start it for me as I mentioned before first of all I did not have rosacea but I had just eyes and yeah they got pretty bad in the beginning it was just a small sigh and then it went away and then another one popped up and another one and they took really really long to get away and even though I was eating a raw vegan diet it took field I think one two weeks until they went away and every morning I woke up I was swollen in my eyes and I couldn't really see that clearly and then I went to the eye doctor and he said well you should also go to a skin doctor because you have a rash around your eyes and Roger knows and that might be rosacea I've never heard of rosacea before and I didn't know what it was so I looked it up and I also went to the doctor and yeah the doctor said he could prescribe me cortisol or antibiotics cream lotion and I said well no thanks and online I also read that rosacea is incurable and there is not really any medicine to get rid of it but I never believed in it because I believe that we can heal our body if we give it the time and space that it needs and was the right diet so well I kept on eating raw foods and also went to a naturopath to take care of this and that was back in 2006 in August November and in 2007 my rosacea really kind of hit me hard and my face was super red and after what a while it also started spreading on my arms and upper body and was itching like hell and I already made a video about that before and I'll link you that down below so you can check it out well yeah and my naturopath um did some energy work for it but she also helped me out with results then I took daily and I'm still taking daily to get things better and another thing I did was I started taking silver hydrosol and that's what I also got from a naturopath um and I took three tablespoons per day and whenever I feel like I caught something like a cold or virus infection I'm still doing this I'm getting silver hydrosol and I'm taking three tablespoons per day throughout the day for about two or three weeks and that helps to kill off some of the viruses and bacteria and to strengthen the immune system but in the beginning I felt like this was making things even worse and yeah my face got even more red and I thought it was because of the silver hydrosol and allergic to react reaction to it but now I know that it was just my body trying to get rid of that virus yeah rosacea also has to do with the liver because if the liver is overburdened and can't detox properly then your body is trying to get rid two toxins in another way and in that case your face and yeah and I when I when I got this I really doubted the raw vegan diet because when I ate papayas when I ate pineapples my face got even worse I couldn't even eat dates or dried fruits because my face would really bloom up and things will get worse so I started eating more greens and that went really well and yeah after a while I don't know I think it took a year at least until my face was back to normal again but still I had some pimples and stuff but it looked way much better than before and after that year I came across I don't know how I came to it actually but yeah I came to it Oh regular oil and I started taking it because oregano is killing off viruses and it's actually a natural antibiotic just like garlic and the difference to antibiotics is that oregano oil actually kills the membrane of the virus that is in you and gets tipped to the virus to kill it what antibiotics can dissolve this biofilm or membrane that is around the virus or bacteria to actually kill it and get rid of it but I'm not recommending you anything is just my experience that I had and have with oregano and and another thing is that if you have virus bacteria over flow in your body meaning also in your gut then the that bacteria take up all of the space and leave less space for a good bacteria and this is what I experienced especially in my digestion because when I started taking the oregano oil after why my digestion got better and then I have time when I stopped it because I saw well everything is fine again and then it get up it kind of got a little bit worse again so I started taking it again and it's also good to have a break in between so your body doesn't get too used to it yeah and since I started taking the oregano oil my skin was totally fine and now two years after my rosacea began I actually got completely rid of it until and the beginning of this year I saw that it's coming back because I got the itchy skin around the nose but I started taking oregano oil and silver hydrosol right away and yeah within just a couple of days the symptoms went away and I was back to normal but nevertheless I want to support my body in killing off whatever is left so I keep on taking the oregano all in addition to lots of other things of course and lots of raw foods oh yeah and one thing that is important if there is strap in the body is to avoid certain foods because these foods would feed the virus and then it would only get worse and those would be things like eggs dairy gluten corn which is what I still had sometimes but well I think eggs and milk products are the worst and of course also a diet free or at least low in meat products would be beneficial but that's my opinion and my experience and I was super super happy that I can now eat as many dates as I want without breaking out in my face and that I can eat papayas again because that's what I couldn't without getting a rat face and if you know me you know that I love papayas that's my favorite fruit so so let's come to a conclusion of all of this the things that help me most to get rid of my rosacea was silver hydrosol and oregano oil but of course I also did two Schuster salts was a life plan to solve some things and some energy work and of course lots of raw foods and especially greens which are rich in minerals and also help to detoxify the body and yeah one more thing I want to say you can smear on as many creams and lotions as you want but most of the healing is done from the inside out and not from the outside in and sure these things help to ease the symptoms and make it yeah make it not feel as a worse but you also got to do the inner work too to finally get rid of all of this and some others things that are pretty orietta that are antiviral or work to kill off viruses and bacteria are of course verbs things like the oregano thyme sage rosemary those are all I've incorporated from time to time into my diet like throwing things into my salads or drinking tea with raw honey oh yeah and of course rosacea can also stem from a lot of mercury in the body and this is why I eat my heavy metal detox foods every day and that includes spirulina well cilantro I don't even eat every day but whenever I can find it because how to find then while blueberries dose of flakes and lattic dose of flakes and yeah I think that's it those are the four things that help to get rid of heavy metals and spirulina is something that I been eating since well many years now frequently you so well I think that's it pretty much those were my experiences and tips and please be aware that this is how I did it and that I'm not recommending you to do anything and I just want to inspire you with what I did and maybe it can help you too but of course you have some kind of issue always talk to your doctor first that's it for today I think if you have any questions or want to know more please leave me your thoughts and comments down below and I'll be happy if you leave me some likes for this video and I also link you my favorite products down below yeah that's it for today I hope you enjoyed this video and was helpful to you and until next time remember keep it light and simple and as always naturally awesome bye the important message of this video would be believe in yourself and your body because you can heal you just need the right diet and some natural tips and you can do it my example short shows that it's possible might take longer for some people but it's always possible keep the face",

        "transcript": "I first developed Rosacea when I was about sixteen I was aware of it because it runs in my family and that's when I first started noticing the redness and spots and I started to think, oh no! I tried some creams, I tried different make-ups, I \n tried gels, antihistamines, I've tried steroids as well which are quite bad for you to use. But, none of those have really made a difference. My face would look red across the cheeks, across \n my nose and under my chin here and I would have little spots, but they weren't spots in the conventional sense, they were \n just sore and red and there was nothing that you could do about them. Living with Rosacea, it knocks your confidence and it brings you to a point where you think why am I bursting into tears over this, \n but I think it is really embarrassing. People don't have to be nasty to you or they don't have \n to make rude comments, they just have to notice it and once they notice it you think, I failed again. I was in the pharmacy just picking up a normal prescription for the steroids that \n I had been using and I'd been quite keen to stop using them. I saw the range of Dermalex that was \n just sort of displayed in the pharmacy and I saw there was one for Rosacea and I thought oh well you've \n tried everything else so you might as well give it a go. I took it home, I waited until that \n night when I'd taken my make-up off just put it on and I woke up in the morning \n and I could see my skin was less angry looking it was a bit softer to touch and I thought well I'll keep up and see how \n it goes and since then it's been really good. Dermalex has just given me the ability to relax about my skincare and not have to use harsh things on my skin and manage it a lot easier. For people that are thinking about using Dermalex I would say just try it. Try it and see, because I wasn't that sure and \n the results that I have had have been brilliant and they continue to be brilliant, so give it a try.",

        "transcript": "hi everyone welcome back thank you so much for\u00a0\nwatching this video i hope you all are well and\u00a0\u00a0 staying safe today's video is going to be my\u00a0\nskincare journey i'm going to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 skin condition which i have been suffering from\u00a0\nlast 15 years which is called rojasia i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to divide this video into different categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there lastly\u00a0\nbefore i go i want to say please be kind to others\u00a0\u00a0 be considerate to people who are suffering from\u00a0\nskin condition before you ask someone about their\u00a0\u00a0 face please think how you would feel if you were\u00a0\nin their shoes i feel like social media is also\u00a0\u00a0 to blame so we are conditioned to think everybody\u00a0\nneeds to have a beautiful skin you always see\u00a0\u00a0 like edited pictures flawless skin clear skin\u00a0\nin real life we have pores we have breakouts\u00a0\u00a0 we have pigmentation nobody has that porcelain\u00a0\nskin or baby like skin still today even though\u00a0\u00a0 i have a clear skin i don't have like a perfect\u00a0\nskin i feel like it is so important to normalize\u00a0\u00a0 skin conditions we need to have open dialogue\u00a0\nand open conversation in social media that is\u00a0\u00a0 how i feel anybody suffering with skin\u00a0\ncondition acne pigmentation or any sort\u00a0\u00a0 of skin condition please be kind to yourself\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching this video once\u00a0\u00a0 again and i hope you found this video helpful\u00a0\nand i'll see you guys on my next video if you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't subscribed please do i love to have\u00a0\nyou on my channel till then take care bye guys",

        "transcript": "[Music] hey guys it's live welcome back to my channel today I am doing a video all about my experience with rosacea treatment so specifically the IPL laser treatments for rosacea and IPL is intense pulsed light and it's basically like the same thing that they do for laser hair removal but it's just a little bit different so I wanted to tell you guys all about it I have some before and after and some like video clips of what the treatments are actually like I live in Halifax Nova Scotia and so if you guys live here the place I go to is called a crest Haven laser and I go to generally she is absolutely amazing and I'm currently actually getting laser hair removal on my armpits and my legs because I have just been so happy with the results of the laser that I got in my face she is incredible she's so knowledgeable and it's just like such a beautiful spot I'll put like a little bit of footage here but yeah so that's where I go okay so starting from the beginning I went in for a consultation she looked at my skin and I answered a little questionnaire and then they tell you if they think that laser is like a good treatment option for you because it doesn't actually work on like all types of rosacea and all types of skin problems so you definitely want to go have a consultation before you like sign up to pay a bunch of money to get your face laser so the treatments themself so there was kind of like two types of treatments that I got the first one was a spot treatment and the second one was a photo rejuvenation facial so the photo rejuvenation facial is something you can just get kind of like as a one-off and it's not necessarily a treatment for rosacea that's what the spot treatment is for but it is just like and overall it's kind of like a facial but with lasers so I got that in combination with the spot treatment spins over quite a while which is why I started it in April and I just had my last one in November and then I had the photo rejuvenation facial at the end to just kind of like improve my skin overall also I should mention I am wearing makeup in this video but I do have before and after pictures where I'm not wearing any makeup so I will show you guys those okay so I'm just about to go to my last laser appointment I will show you how my skin is looking right now lately I haven't had an appointment in about two months I think around that are like a month and a half and so I'm just going for one more so basically all you do is you go in they put on this like kind of like gel or like goo on your face it's kind of like ultrasound stuff that they put on before they do an ultrasound for pregnant women and then you put on your protective eyeglasses and then they don't take the laser and they it'll beep and then the light will flick and then it looks like a couple more times and she'll kind of like move it around and then it'll go maybe then she'll like move it around a couple more times and then they just do it so I had it like here and on my chin and here but they would do it wherever you have your rosacea [Music] okay so I just finished with my appointment and this is what my skin looks like after the laser so she did like a full face photo rejuvenation facial um which is like what they do for sun damage and just like overall appearance of skin and then the IPL she did after and that's just on my cheeks so you can see that's where it's like a little bit more red photo rejuvenation facial doesn't hurt at all I don't find like it's pretty mild but the IPL one they can't use the same cooling system as the photo rejuvenation so it definitely feels a lot hotter and there's more pain but as you can see it's totally manageable and it's yeah I've just kind of gotten used to it and it takes honestly like five minutes not even so it's really quick and it only really hurts at the time of like the pulse of light overall I am just so happy with the just quality of my skin now like when I before I started this my skin was really red the worst part like you can cover the redness with makeup but the worst part for me was just how hot my skin felt all the time like my face always just felt like there was a lot of blood rushing to it and a huge thing I noticed after doing the laser is even if my skin sometimes still looks a little bit red it doesn't feel super hot which I really like I really did notice a huge difference from start to finish and I honestly would recommend it to anyone who is a candidate for it if you have any questions about this or anything that I didn't answer leave them in the comments below and I will answer them for you guys but that is everything I have for today I hope this video was interesting or at least helpful to some of you and I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]",

        "published_at": "2021-06-23T13:00:10Z",
        "transcript": "so many of you have been requesting videos on rosacea especially since i talked about it being a skin condition that i personally struggle with so i thought a good place to start is to tell you a little bit about what rosacea is and some do's and don'ts to follow if you have rosacea i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and find skincare products that work for you first of all what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic but treatable skin condition that typically involves the face now i say treatable and not curable because sometimes patients will come see me in my office expect to get a treatment regimen for three to four months for their rosacea and then never deal with it again and the reality is that rosacea is a lifelong condition and there will be times when it's flaring and there will be times when it's under really good control but the goals of rosacea management aren't to get rid of it because there's no cure but to manage it in a way where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life and where you're happy with your skin it's a persistent inflammatory skin condition meaning that it often presents with redness and irritation and i'll talk a little bit more about the signs and symptoms of rosacea in a minute but it also affects men and women the women slightly more than men and it is really a disease of adults so the onset of rosacea is usually after the age of 30. more than 16 million americans have rosacea that's about 1 in 20 people and we think that globally about 5.5 percent of the world's population also has rosacea rosacea symptoms can include easily flushing or blushing persistent facial redness visible vessels on the skin surface easily irritated skin scaly skin dry skin itchy skin it also can affect the eyes so some people will get grittiness or irritation in their eyes and the last thing is that rosacea can have pimples and so it is often misdiagnosed as acne someone with rosacea might just have one or two of those symptoms and someone might have all of the things i just listed so it really can exist on a spectrum of severity but also the presentation can vary widely from person to person one question i get all the time is why do i have rosacea what is causing it is it something that i am doing and oftentimes it's not it we know that rosacea is caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors but a lot of times people don't have full control over those and so it's not about what's causing your rosacea at that point it's more about you have rosacea what are we going to do about it and it's great that we have awesome treatments to help get rosacea under control for people and manage those signs and symptoms so they're not suffering from their skin condition on a day-to-day basis prior to just a few years ago we used to categorize people with rosacea based on kind of the main signs or symptoms that they were presenting with i'm gonna go over those four categorizations even though we don't really use those clinically anymore because i do think it helps people understand the signs and symptoms that rosacea can present with but just know we don't use those categorizations anymore because we understand that people with rosacea can kind of have overlapping symptoms that span more than one category the first of sort of these four categories of rosacea is something called erythematolangictatic rosacea and really what this means is rosacea presenting with facial redness and typically this is redness in the center of the face so the chin the cheeks the nose and the forehead and this is redness that is often present at baseline but then gets worse with flushing or blushing based on exposure to certain triggers and then with that flushing or blushing you can also have altered sensations of the skin like sensitivity stinging burning or sort of this overwhelming heat sensation the other thing that can happen with this erythematologic rosacea is the presence of telangiectasias which are dilated blood vessels that are visible on the skin surface the second prior subtype of rosacea was something called papulopustular rosacea and really this was rosacea presenting with red bumps or red pustules which are red bumps filled with pus this is the type of rosacea or a feature of rosacea that is most commonly mistaken or mistreated as acne so it's something that's important for your doctor to be able to recognize the third prior categorization of rosacea was something called thymidus rosacea also called rhinophyma when it specifically involved the nose but really this is the development of sort of a thick bumpy texture to the skin and it's not a common feature of rosacea but it's certainly something to keep an eye out for the fourth category of rosacea was ocular rosacea or rosacea involving the eye this will often present as irritation light sensitivity watering eyes a gritty sensation in the eye but like i said before we are not using these four categorizations anymore we know that people can have redness and eye symptoms or feminist features and papules and pustules so it's more about what each unique person is presenting with when we're diagnosing and treating their rosacea so let's get into the do's and don'ts of rosacea i just want to put a caveat here though that these are guidelines they are not strict rules i know i'm a physician i'm a board certified dermatologist and i'm telling you these things about rosacea but just know that everyone's skin is different and if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is fine it's no big deal but these might be things that are worth thinking about if your rosacea is not under optimal control and you're trying to figure out ways for you to intervene and make a meaningful positive difference see a dermatologist we are able to accurately diagnose and give you a treatment plan for your rosacea i cannot tell you how many times i've seen rosacea misdiagnosed as acne lupus an allergic reaction eczema seborrheic dermatitis if your face is red or bumpy or sensitive and you don't know why get the help of an expert to make sure you're treating the right thing get to know your rosacea triggers and then avoid those triggers so although we don't know all of the causes of rosacea we do know certain environmental factors make rosacea worse and they can really vary from person to person so things like sun exposure hot or cold weather stress alcohol chocolate dairy spicy foods i mean the list goes on and it really is unique to each person what i recommend is that if you're not sure what your triggers are keep a rosacea diary any time your rosacea is flaring write down what you ate what you drink and what your surrounding environment is like being more aware of your triggers and avoiding them will absolutely help your rosacea stay under better control protect your skin from the sun so wide brim hats please and then sunscreen every single day now i used to tell my rosacea patients to use mineral-based sunscreens only so those with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as the uv filters because we thought they were maybe a little bit less irritating but what i found over time is that a lot of my rosacea patients can tolerate chemical uv filters in their sunscreen just fine so rather than limiting my patients sunscreen options i let them know that it might be a little bit of trial and error to find a sunscreen that they love but once they do use it every day keep your skin well moisturized people with rosacea often will have some skin barrier disruption and be more prone to barrier disruption even if they're using gentle skin care so using a nice moisturizer that feels good on your skin that doesn't cause stinging every single day and maybe sometimes twice a day if you're feeling particularly dry will help your skin feel better and look better too and my final do is have realistic expectations of what's achievable when treating rosacea typically the goals should be to have fewer flares and have your symptoms be well managed but if your goal is to have zero evidence that you've ever had rosacea you're really likely to be disappointed and i'm not saying that to be debbie downer dermatologist over here but if you focus on incremental improvement you're much more likely to find success in your treatment and be happier for it let's get into the don'ts i feel like i have to say this one more time before i get into the don'ts which is if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is totally fine that's okay keep doing it these are not rosacea laws these are just recommendations don't overheat your skin or expose it to extreme temperatures now this can be tricky to do all of the time but we do know that really cold weather and wind as well as really hot weather and indoor heating can all flare rosacea don't rub or scrub the face so any type of physical manipulation or physical exfoliation can cause increased redness and irritation so that goes for physical exfoliants like microbeads or scrubs as well as even like the rough fibers of a towel rubbed on the face they can all cause increased irritation so pat your face dry don't aggressively massage it just be nice to your skin don't use too many products a simple skincare regimen really is best especially if you're incorporating prescription topical medications to treat your rosacea you really don't want to be layering product after product after product you also might be sensitive to certain products so doing a little patch test in front of your ear or on your jawline for several days before kind of using it all over your entire face is not a bad idea don't use certain skin care ingredients that are known to trigger rosacea not every person with rosacea is going to be sensitive to the same types of skincare ingredients but in a survey conducted by the national rosacea society there were some ingredients that more people tended to be sensitive to and those are things like alcohol witch hazel fragrance menthol peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil there are other types of skin care ingredients like tretinoin and retinoids salicylic acid glycolic acid benzoyl peroxide antioxidants and topical vitamin c and people want to know i have rosacea those things can be irritating can i use them and really it's on a case-by-case basis one thing i recommend is never introducing more than one active to your regimen at once so if you're thinking okay i want to introduce a retinoid go low and slow and kind of see how it works out for you i use tretinoin in my routine even though i have rosacea but i could not do that initially i had to get my rosacea under really good control before i could incorporate that ingredient i never want to say anything is truly off limits for my rosacea patients but just know that you have to use things like acids or exfoliators with caution and understand that even if you can't tolerate them at this point in your rosacea journey you might be able to in the future don't be afraid to use prescription medication i find that sometimes in clinic i meet resistance from patients who just want to use over-the-counter options but this is a true skin disease and i don't find that most of my patients want over-the-counter options for their other types of diseases that they have skin disease should be no different don't be afraid of the prescriptions they are really developed for the treatment of rosacea they have been well studied give them a shot and my final don't is if you have rosacea and you have not been able to get it under control don't feel hopeless okay team up with a dermatologist maybe get a second opinion and also understand that rosacea is constantly being researched we are learning more about this condition day by day and as we move forward we are going to have even better treatments and interventions to offer what tips have helped you with your rosacea put them in the comments below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see

        "published_at": "2021-07-31T14:00:20Z",
        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "why hey guys happy of October day 26 welcome back to the Q&A today's Q&A is for all of those rosacea sufferers out there who have been requesting a Q&A on cilantro or topical ivermectin for rosacea if you're not familiar with rosacea it is a fairly common skin condition God is characterized by a tendency towards redness on the face and the central face with flushing and it's really a challenging skin disease for sufferers to navigate because anything they put on their face whether it be sunscreen or face wash moisturizer makeup and often can sting and burn and precipitate a flare of redness in addition to redness and kind of a flushed appearance people with rosacea also suffer from red bumps papules pustules most commonly overlying the central face around the nose as well and sometimes the skin can become thick swollen and over time develop a almost dilated pore type appearance that can really bother people people may describe this as a textural but really it's just the inflammation of the rosacea kind of distorting the architecture of the skin anatomy a little bit without swelling and redness the pathophysiology of rosacea appears to be multifactorial it largely is determined probably by our genetics which we have to thank for many things as well as environmental conditions it can flare we know with ultraviolet light exposure changes in the humidity and things that we put on our face can also precipitate a flare of rosacea certain foods in our diet can can precipitate a flare and then some people many people with rosacea it has been demonstrated have a high burden of something called demodex mites on theirs demodex mites sound really terrifying and they freak everyone out they are a component of normal skin flora everyone has demodex mites they don't cause rosacea per se it appears that people with rosacea because they are so sensitive to things on the skin they may have a sensitivity to demodex and for whatever reason they also have a high burden of demodex mites on their skin in comparison to people who do not have rosacea and it's thought that this kind of excess burden of demodex as well as the sensitivity to these little mites can contribute to the redness the flushing and the severity of an individual's rosacea so this is where the topical drug cilantro or ivermectin comes into play ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that has been around for about 20 years and it has a very wide safety margin and is used to treat many many many parasites both in human medicine as well as veterinary medicine I not only systemic parasites but different kinds of parasites and mites that may get on on your skin and cause rashes so this cream became of interest for people with rosacea given the fact that it had been demonstrated that people with rosacea have a higher burden of demodex on their skin the way cilantro or ivermectin works is it has very very very high affinity and selectivity for a non channel that is present in invertebrate muscle cells and nerve cells so it binds to that little channel and can affect the way signaling occurs across those cell membranes in the mite or the parasite the invertebrate and effectively paralyze it so it's a kind of a it's a paralytic agent essentially it's selective only for the might has really no no consequences to human health animal health it doesn't cross our blood-brain barrier so it can't affect the nerves in our central nervous system at all and it's very safe and even safer when applied topically in a cream form such as with cilantro repurposing an old drug for a new indication is nothing new in medicine and occurs frequently for a variety of conditions and other drugs as well topical cilantro or ivermectin was first examined and randomized controlled trials of people with populo pustular rosacea people with the type of rosacea that's comprised of that the red bumps applied topically to the entire face once a day for 12 weeks was shown to not only be effective at reducing the burden of inflammatory lesions but also is very very well tolerated and actually in comparison to the vehicle arm or the cream without the active drug in it they actually had fewer side-effects of stinging and irritation so it's safe it's effective and it's very well tolerated then later on cilantro was compared in 16 week trials to a standard of care treatment for rosacea which is topical metronidazole 0.75% and after 16 weeks and of treatment the group getting the cilantro actually had better overall improvement in their burden of rosacea papules and pustules in comparison to those receiving metronidazole topically so it appears that cilantro or ivermectin is is much more effective or a little bit more effective at least down than topical metronidazole and in other studies looking at it in Arsen azelaic acid it seems to be kind of comparable to azelaic acid or Phoenicia for rosacea i have a video on as a white acid so it's not something that you are interested in make sure you check that video out it like all of my q and a's are found in a playlist called skincare q and A's you'll find that there to be q and A's on rosacea and various topical drugs used to treat rosacea so go check in there if you have any any other questions I may have already addressed them but overall topical cilantro is pretty effective for popular pustular rosacea and is very safe and is very well tolerated it is pregnancy category C so it is not indicated during pregnancy unfortunately whereas azelaic acid is okay in pregnancy but otherwise it's very safe and when applied to the skin is absorbed systemically at a very very low amount and even even that which is absorbed we know to be safe because it is far less than what it's given in oral doses it's largely more effective for the papules or the bumps and pustules to those components of the rosacea that look like whiteheads it's largely effective at reducing the burden of those it can lessen some of the severity of persistent facial redness but it will not unfortunately wipe away that facial redness completely but it will it will help substantially for both the popular pustular lesions as well as at least in my experience with this drug some of that persistent redness although again it will not completely erase the redness but when coupled with something like pulsed dye laser however the outlook at improving persistent facial redness you can imagine improves even moreso than either treatment by itself so the combination of the two can really offer an individual great potential for substantial and cilantro will be effective in anywhere from 40 to 80% of people using it and as far as how well it is tolerated probably about one in 88 or so individuals will stop using it after a year due to side effects like stinging or burning or irritation if you have rosacea you know that can be the case with pretty much anything you put on your face so it's not surprising that cilantro is not an exception but in comparison to other topical treatments used for rosacea it actually seems to be much better as far as those side effects of stinging and irritation but invariably somebody's going to have problems with it it is not going to work for everybody with rosacea and there's you really know what good way to know for sure if it will be effective for you now the follow-up question that everybody will want to know is well do I have to use it forever what happens when I stop using it well following discontinuation unfortunately symptoms will return within about four months in roughly half of people so while it can offer sustained control after cessation that is not always the case in fact about 50% of people the symptoms will return when they stop when they stop the drug so something that has to be continued for many people for the long term that being said one thing to bear in mind is that it is not a cheap drug unfortunately it should be but it is not so a one month supply of topical cilantro roughly a month treatment that cost around three hundred and twenty dollars here in the United States in comparison to metronidazole which is about roughly a hundred and twenty dollars so quite a bit more expensive oral doxycycline a pill that you may have taken for rosacea is also quite a bit cheaper than a topical cilantro now your health and the way you feel about yourself the control of your rosacea should not be dictated by price but I'm telling you this because given that there are other effective treatments for rosacea don't be surprised unfortunately if your health insurance declines coverage of the cilantro sometimes they'll cover it with a prior authorization letter written by your dermatologist I find it to be very helpful for pata papules and pustules of rosacea and to impart modest improvement in persistent facial redness related to rosacea and it also enhances the outcomes of other treatments like I said like pulse dye laser but yeah that's really all there is to it for cilantro it's great that we've found and you used for an old drug I'm Remington I just wish there wasn't it wasn't quite so expensive it does offer quite a bit of hope for people with rosacea and improving their their burden of disease and so I hope that this video was helpful and kind of going over how effective it is that it's very well tolerated and hopefully gave you some information how it compares to some of the other standard of care treatments which you may have already tried and been frustrated with so again I hope this video was helpful to you guys and kind of answering your questions and if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe guys tomorrow [Music]

        "transcript": "I'm someone who has experienced rosacea all my life but I also make up a lot of people with rosacea in my experience it's been so bad sometimes that it's really affected my self-esteem other times I can it's absolutely fine and my skin is gray I think as a GP I see firsthand just how distressing it can be to have the facial flushing and the spots and so on that are so obvious and often at a time of life when people are expecting to compassed spots I've done the makeup so that it is really realistic and this is kind of the rosacea that I would get at it's very very worst from dermatologists point we are here on the main challenges well this condition is under recognized so people suffer for don't seek medical attention or we suffer and when they come to check injuries sometimes don't know what's happening I think this campaign for me is really important because what it's really saying is you're not on your own you don't have to put up with it often it can be really easily treated but you do need to come tell us about it so usually people wants to know that's what really resonated with me about today is the fact that rosacea is one of those conditions that's so misunderstood but it impacts people's confidence in such a negative way you don't know how people perceive you but what we do know is that we are all judged on our appearance in a really short period of time yeah it's that quick snap decision what we make about people isn't there and I think if your beds you look like you're not in control you're not calm do you know what rosacea is no I don't okay and you're there nope okay never heard of it no I never heard of it have you ever heard the skin condition called rosacea no have you ever seen anybody walking down the street with a very red rush to pay yes and what might you think that was would you look the strangest thing about the process today I think was probably going into a bar because when you go out in the evening to have a drink it's part of the process that you put on makeup you want to look your best you have a great outfit I think that going into the bar with a really really red face and knowing that everybody was looking at me even if they weren't looking at me thinking that they were looking at me made me feel a little bit more embarrassed I don't know if I judge them I think I would I would definitely look at them and wonder what he was but any judge with rosacea you do presume that they've been drink I search off the makeup I did my makeup as I normally would and I definitely feel better I definitely feel more like me I think today was a really great experience what interested me most was that the majority of people who looked at my face their reaction was you've had a reaction to some sort of chemical you've had a reaction to some sort of skincare or to makeup or maybe you're sunburned not one single person said oh you look like you've got rosacea so that tells me that we need to learn more about rosacea I would say that the majority of people who have rosacea don't know that they have rosacea and they could be treating it and they could they may not have to live with it anymore I don't really know but I've heard it's getting some playing I know it does what it might be I really wouldn't be able to guess I mean sometimes when they were disease could come from someone whose discover there or someone who first had it I don't know but educate me",

        "transcript": "hey what if I told you that rosacea is not a skin issue but rather just a symptom of a deeper problem within your body so if you wake up every morning dreading the thought of facing yet another day battling your rosacea and the sight of your inflamed skin despite all your efforts to control the flares makes you want to hide from the world and leaves you feeling utterly defeated then stick around because this video is just for you my friend it's time to stop treating rosacea like it's a skin issue and start addressing the underlying root causes of the problem today we're going to talk about how your rosacea symptoms are connected to your gut health and potentially to a situation called histamine intolerance I'm Tammy Anderson functional health expert and when it comes to the pain embarrassment and frustration of dealing with a stubborn skin issue I've been in your shoes for like 20 years and I know the pain and suffering all too well and I've had the privilege of working with numerous clients who came to me in that place of profound despair just wanting to hide themselves from the world much like how you might be feeling right now as well but the good news is just like myself and my clients who have healed their rosacea I want to assure you that there is hope that it is possible to put an end to the suffering from rosacea once and for all but like I said a minute ago you have to stop treating it like a skin issue and start addressing the root causes of the problem one of which is gut issues and very likely an underlying issue called histamine intolerance quick story many years ago when I saw a naturopathic doctor for the first time I was told that my skin troubles were rooted in a leaky gut but at the time this was a totally foreign concept to me and honestly she didn't do a very good job of explaining what having a leaky gut meant and for the life of me I simply couldn't wrap my head around how on Earth my gut could have anything to do with my problem skin now while this doctor really didn't do much for me in terms of offering the right guidance to heal my gut and I didn't really see any results in working with her it did open my eyes and my mind to the concept that my gut was somehow connected to at least my skin health and it wasn't until several years later actually when I started focusing on healing myself from the inside out and addressing my gut health when I was making a truly desperate attempt to get my life back because I was dealing with a life-threatening respiratory issue that's when I noticed that not only did my respiratory problem in the laundry list of other health issues that I had been dealing with all started to disappear at the same time and along with those issues my skin trouble started to disappear as well and and I had been dealing with awful skin for like 20 years at that point and that's when I had my big aha moment and it became clear to me that all of these symptoms which I had just attributed to bad luck or bad genetics were all intricately connected to an underlying problem and it wasn't until later that I actually discovered that histamine intolerance was at the root cause of this laundry list of symptoms that I had been struggling with and I also understood the crucial role of gut healing in reversing histamine intolerance and truly healing myself from the inside out so what I want you to understand is that your gut health is intimately linked to your overall well-being and that includes your skin your skin is the largest organ of your body and skin related symptoms are just your body telling you that something is wrong on the inside so think about this your gut is the one part of your body that is inside your body but is also exposed to the outside world it's like a long tube that stretches from your mouth including your nose all the way through your body through the exit at the other end so the lining of your gut acts as a protective barrier against external threats from the outside world like toxins pathogens inflammatory foods and other things however when this lining becomes compromised a condition called leaky gut occurs and what happens is the Once really tightly connected cells that line your gut loosen up and that allows toxins pathogens undigested food particles and other things to enter your bloodstream where they don't belong and this triggers a red alert from the immune system and that leads to widespread inflammation throughout the body and a host of chronic symptoms and other conditions can result from this so before I go further into how a damaged gut lining can lead to histamine and tolerance parents and your rosacea symptoms I want to invite you to grab access to the free histamine video training that I've created for you if you're ready to dive deeper into understanding and addressing the underlying causes of histamine intolerance and just truly transforming your skin and your life so the link for that is in the description below this video so make sure to go grab that alright so back to the gut when the gut is leaky and damaged another critical function of the gut is compromised and that is the production of an enzyme called diamine oxidase or Dao Dao is primarily produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine and its function is to break down and neutralize histamine preventing it from building up too much in the body and reducing the risk of histamine-related symptoms so when the gut lining becomes compromised it gets damaged and the Dao enzyme production or function becomes insufficient because of that gut lining damage histamine levels start to go up and up and up leading to a condition known as histamine intolerance now histamine plays many roles in the body a major one of which is immune responses and because of this we need the ability to get histamine anywhere in the body in an instant whenever there's a need for it has an immune response that's why we have histamine receptors on virtually every cell of the body and because of that histamine intolerance can manifest as a wide range of symptoms throughout the body and that includes your skin and yes that also includes rosacea so rosacea may be your most visible sign that you might be dealing with a histamine intolerance but there are other Telltale indicators that histamine intolerance could be an underlying issue for you so if you experience other unexplained symptoms in other parts of your body like headaches or migraines fatigue allergies or respiratory problems itching anxiety or panic attacks a rapid heartbeat fainting spells sleep issues urinary urgency food sensitivity digestive issues like bloating or diarrhea then these are some big clues that an underlying histamine intolerance is probably going on because there's usually a cluster of symptoms it's not just one thing and everybody by the way has kind of a different cluster of symptoms so no two people may have the exact same symptom profile when they have a histamine intolerance so like I said too much histamine built up in the body can create Havoc anywhere in the body so if you want to truly be free from the pain inflammation and embarrassment of rosacea once and for all and have clear skin and more confidence you need to shift your focus from the surface problem to the root causes and that starts with improving your gut health that is absolutely critical so if you're ready to start fixing your gut and want a strategic and effective no guessing no Rabbit Hole diving approach so that you can start feeling lighter and more confident in your skin I've created a gut repair tool kit for you and you can get started on that Journey right away you'll find a link to find more information and get started today in the description below this video so when it comes to your skin and your overall health it's critical to understand that it's never just one thing there's almost always a combination of factors involved that create What I Call The Perfect Storm and that's why it's so important to take a truly holistic approach when addressing the underlying issues and not just treat it as a skin issue so my self-guided program the histamine solution Academy guides you to implement a truly holistic approach to address the problem from the inside out it's structured around four important pillars that work together to allow you to get deep healing from within by addressing all the contributing factors so the pillars include nutritional support lifestyle and environment modifications

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

type symptoms uh and when you do some testing for that and you treat it that oftentimes will clear up their uh their rosacea [Music] [Applause] welcome to the doctor's pharmacy i'm dr mark hyman that's pharmacy with an f-f-a-r-m-a-c-y a place for conversations that matter and if you've got skin problems you should listen up because this conversation is going to matter to you particularly something called rosacea acne rosacea it's a terrible skin condition we'll talk about what it is but if you have it you know what i'm talking about and it is miserable and today we have with us none other than dr todd lepin who's my colleague a frequent guest here on the special episode of the doctor's pharmacy the house call episode he's a graduate of dartmouth medical school he's board certified internal medicine we've worked together for decades now it's almost 10 non three decades it's kind of scary holy cow you don't look any different than the day i met you so functional must be working uh he is an incredible guy and his teachers all over the world well not so much anymore but you know virtually now actually and and has been uh as part of the faculty in the institute for functional medicine uh american college of advancement of medicine age management medicine and many many other great great organizations so todd welcome back to the doctor's pharmacy thank you mark okay so first of all we're talking about this weird condition that some people never heard of called acne rosacea we're going to talk about what it is how traditional medicine deals with it why that's all wrong and how we approach it using functional medicine so what is acne rosacea okay well that's acne rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition that adults get it's also another name for it is adult acne and patients who have it will get redness to the face usually over the the cheeks and the nose sometimes the chin and you can also be pretty severe you can get uh telangiectasias which are like little uh blood vessels there's like little like blood lines in your face vasodilation of the blood vessels papules pustules so it looks like adult acne is really what it is and interestingly it's fairly common about ten percent of the population has it uh it tends to be more common in people who have celtic origin so irish scottish uh english which is interesting i'll talk about that later i'm jewish from the middle east i'm safe yeah it might be absolutely it might be it might be yeah um and uh a lot of famous people have actually had this uh bill clinton yeah has won uh wc fields uh and bulbus yeah so one of the complications of rosacea is chronic inflammatory changes to the skin so you can get what's called rhinophyma which is basically when you see a clown with the red nose that's rhinophyma yeah that's what right red nose and it can be actually quite debilitating i mean when it gets really really bad you can uh get this distortion of the facial features especially over the nose yeah yeah so it's this really nasty kind of acne and it's what's what triggers it do we know from a traditional medicine point of view well there are a variety of different triggers when people have rosacea uh things that can trigger it are spicy foods uh alcohol can do it yeah i mean alcoholics tend to get this a lot right if you're an alcoholic and wc feels clearly was yeah yeah if those of you who don't know he has google it yeah that's probably before your time but it's it it is often driven by alcohol yeah and i i i my own theory on alcohol as it ties in with that is that alcohol does vasodilate blood vessels but also alcohol in excess is also a big contributor to leaky gut and i always you know i get my patients to understand this uh concept that alcohol can promote leaky gut so i took a shot of tequila and i threw it in your eye what would happen it would burn your eye would water right you're able to get leaky you have leaky eye leaky gut so chronic alcohol ingestion is probably one of the biggest things for low-grade endotoxin and leaky gut and that's also tied in as we'll talk about uh in terms of irritable bowel and yeah we're going to get into leaky gut because that is it's a very big issue general and particularly with things like skin disorders like acne rosacea yeah yeah exactly so so todd um you know in functional medicine we we take a very different view which is we treat things from the inside out not the outside in right dermatology is all about lotions potions and creams and slathering stone on your face to sort of get it good from the outside in but it's kind of it's kind of backwards yeah so what what are the traditional treatments for rosacea and why are they not the best idea you know when i went through my medical training there was an old uh saying that the dermatologist basically if it's if it's dry wet it if it's wet moisturize it and if you don't know what's going on give it a steroid that's that's essentially pretty much right that's pretty much dermatology i learned the same lesson yeah right that's that's that's it and you know dermatology and if if it's wet dry it if it's dry wet it and if you don't know give it a stir exactly that's that's that's the the mantra of the modern uh uh dermatologist um but again it's like you said it's it's it's an external manifestation of something going on internally uh so the question is is what's driving this and uh in in preparing for this talk i mean i've i've seen so many patients with rosacea it's not funny but what do they put on there they give antibiotics on the face yeah they'll give like give like uh uh you know metronidazole cream uh which is topical uh uh anti uh antibiotics it's like an antiparasite antibiotic yeah one of the newer one of the newer medications and this is sort of an interesting thing is a is a cream called ivermectin so this sort of blew me away because this is relatively new and i think we were talking about it it's a worm pill it's a it's a parasite uh they're using it for covet even really yeah yeah yeah so so it's really it was it so it said to my so i i i was reading and i had actually had a patient who came in and was on the ivermectin cream and was doing very very well on the ivermectin cream and then i said to myself well how is an anti-parasitic medication topically helping with uh words yeah well it's also that's also interesting because one of the things that uh is strongly tied in with uh uh rosacea now remember rosacea is just over the face it's it's it's this facial manifestation of an internal uh issue is that we have these little creepy crawlers on our face and they're called uh mites skin mites yeah uh uh uh dermadecks like dust mites we all have them we there everybody has these and the interesting thing is that patients who have rosacea have a much much higher density of skin mites on them for whatever reason and normally they they basically they're like little uh you call them like little parasites that they're ectoparasites and they sit on the skin and they they eat your dead tissues and they they uh eat off of the oils on the on the glands and normally you don't have a reaction to them they're sort of like a benign parasite but in some people who have high concentrations of these skin mites the body makes a very very high immune response to it so uh getting back to the ivermectin which is basically an anti-anti-parasitic it may be actually working as an anti-parasitic for some of these skin mites yeah so maybe there's an infectious cause to this yeah so yeah so yeah so the things they use are menocycline which is an antibiotic flagella or metronidazole which isn't any parasite an antibiotic every mechanin which is an anti-worm oh oral oral doxocycle is another one yeah oral antibiotics which probably is a really bad idea given yeah exactly you have a microbiome you don't want to be killing it to fix your skin exactly exactly yeah and why that why might that minicycline work why might antibiotics orally work well there's a there's a thought and there's actually it's actually in the literature is that uh small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also one of the triggers for rosacea a lot of patients that you see with rosacea will have irritable bowel type symptoms or bloating type symptoms and when you do some testing for that and you treat it that oftentimes will clear up their uh their rosacea yeah um yeah absolutely yeah so i think i think you know we're not averse to using topicals and topical medication when necessary but if you really focus on root causes which is what functional medicine does you come up with a very different set of approaches that actually works better is longer lasting and doesn't require to keep putting on lotions potions and creams for the rest of your life or taking oral antibiotics right exactly and then the way getting back to the ivermectin ivermectin and i uh in preparing for this talk i did some little a little bit of research and the patients who are more prone towards uh rosacea have a problem with too much of what's called uh the catholic side and antimicrobial peptides so these are these mouthful yeah they called camps camp uh catholicism and antimicrobial peptides and these peptides are part of the built-in innate part of the immune system to protect our skin against various types of infections and it turns out that ivermectin actually uh helps with these uh these antimicrobial peptides because people who have rosacea have too much of these peptides they have like an over uh uh robust response to uh antimicrobials so it's it's thought that the uh one of the it's actually a breakdown products called ll-37 and uh ivermectin actually works on dampening down these uh antimicrobial peptides to decrease inflammation in the skin okay so in terms of in terms of the cause it seems to be a combination of internal and external factors right something on the skin and then some things internally but from traditional medicine there really isn't an approach to helping heal the skin from the inside out no no no and whether you have acne or eczema or psoriasis or rosacea or any one of the myriad skin conditions that we get most of them have their root cause inside not on the topical level exactly and and often it's the gut yeah absolutely yeah so you mentioned a little bit earlier leaky gut so take us through from a functional medicine perspective are thinking about the root causes what are what are the things that you think about when someone comes in your office and their face is all red and they've got all this acne on there and they've got like little intel injectation these little red lines everywhere and you can see the blood vessels dilated and they're kind of looking like uh santa claus yeah exactly yeah and also they get they also get photosensitivity too which is the other the other thing and the interesting they can't go in the sun without getting it worse and and that that also ties in with these uh antimicrobial peptides because uh it's thought it's theorized that the the the celts the ones who live in the higher northern uh latitudes they don't get as much sun as we do so it's thought that from an evolutionary standpoint that they benefit by having this they have a more robust immune system when there's not enough sunshine and and sunshine will actually activate this this innate immune system and that's why sun exposure oftentimes makes it worse because they produce more of these antimicrobial peptides and then those antimicrobial peptides have to get processed and in the process of uh breaking them apart the immune system then starts responding to it so that's why there's a sort of a photosensitivity aspect to it and what are the other sort of things you think about when someone comes to your office with rosacea well uh one of the things i oftentimes look at is their vitamin d levels uh vitamin d is is is part of the uh immune system and it uh it's tied in with uh intimately with the antimicrobial peptides system in the body so oftentimes patients who have this have low vitamin d levels uh we'll look at the microbiome testing to see if there's any evidence of dysbiosis bacterial overgrowth testing the sibo testing checking for hydrogen and methane i mean probably the majority of patients who i see of rosacea have problems with with bacterial overgrowth other thing is low stomach acid which also promotes and contributes to bacterial overgrowth yeah so checking for the patients uh sometimes these patients are also on ppis uh acid blocking acid blocking medications absolutely yep yeah because we have acid in our stomach to help us to digest food it's also there to decrease uh the amount of bacteria higher up in the colon so uh it's good it's good to have stomach acid yeah it says if you don't have stomach acid then the ph of your small intestine changes becomes more alkaline and then bugs grow in there that wouldn't necessarily grow yeah and that's when you get this overgrowth of bad bugs in there and it it can be what we call sibo which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where bad bugs migrate up from the lower intestine into the small intestine and then when you eat foods you get bloating distension it causes leaky gut you end up causing damage to the lining of the gut and food particles and bacterial toxins leak in and create inflammation throughout the body and on the skin so you know leaky gut can cause hundreds of different manifestations one of which is rosacea and unless you think about that and learn how to treat it you may not be able to be successful with it there's also another condition that i've seen todd in a lot of my patients called sifo sifo small intestinal fungal overgrowth and a lot of people talk about it as candida but there's many many species of yeast and fungus and and so what i found often is that treating the gut through addressing the bacterial overgrowth the yeast overgrowth healing leaky gut dealing with the food sensitivities makes a profound impact yeah and a lot of times it is food sensitivities that can trigger i mean for example gluten we've talked about on the show that is one of the biggest drivers of leaky gut yeah and even even if you are not celiac and even if you don't think you have any symptoms or don't notice any symptoms when you eat gluten dr alessia fasano who's the world's expert at harvard on gluten he said everybody who eats gluten creates some level of leaky gut right now most people kind of handle it right transient leaky gut exactly so i don't know like it's probably not a good idea to eat that much gluten because of the potential to create leaky gut and how that is linked to so many chronic diseases including weight gain diabetes cancer heart disease alzheimer's autoimmune diseases allergies act i mean you just name it depression all this stuff is connected by by leaky gut so i really i think you know getting a very different thinking about this is key and you you did you talked about the stomach acid you talked about the acid blockers you talked about maybe other things that that you know are relevant in the gut and certain infections like h pylori which is a common bacteria that causes ulcers also has been linked to h pylori and food sensitivities hey everybody it's dr hyman thanks for tuning in to the doctor's pharmacy i hope you're loving this podcast it's one of my favorite things to do and introducing you all the experts that i know and i love and that i've learned so much from and i want to tell you about something else i'm doing which is called mark's picks it's my weekly newsletter and in it i share my favorite stuff from foods to supplements to gadgets to tools to enhance your health it's all the cool stuff that i use and that my team uses to optimize and enhance our health and i'd love you to sign up for the weekly newsletter i'll only send it to you once a week on fridays nothing else i promise and all you do is go to drhymen.com forward slash pics to sign up that's drhyman.com forward slash picks p-i-c-k-s and sign up for the newsletter and i'll share with you my favorite stuff that i use to enhance my health and get healthier and better and live younger longer now back to this week's episode so how do we approach these patients when they come in what are the kinds of things that we would do from a diagnostic point of view that you wouldn't get when you went to the dermatologist well from a diagnostic standpoint uh again i would do testing for um you know uh leaky gut that would do intestinal permeability testing checking for antibodies to zonulin with the cyrex testing that we do cyrex array number three so that's basically there's a test that we do at the center for uh at the ultra wellness center here in lenox massachusetts where we're recording live is uh cyrex testing it's a lab that looks at antibodies that you produce against these proteins that are in your gut that come from gluten or even from bacteria and so if you're creating a lot of antibodies to these proteins it's clear that they're getting across the lining of your gut leaking into your bloodstream and causing an immune response which is not only local but systemic right and and i and there are there are other ways you can actually measure zonulin in the blood and you can measure it also in the stool and that's only like a snapshot in time so you can develop leaky gut for you know a couple hours or a day or so but if it if it stops then you're all so fine the antibodies against zonulin is the one that tells you that there's this chronic leaky gut which is really more valuable because if i gave you a shot at tequila then you know an hour later measure your zone it's going to go up okay where's the tequila that sounds good right so so that's why i think that the uh the the testing for the antibodies against uh zonulin is even more valuable in these patients with chronic conditions uh and what other kinds of tests besides the the uh the zonulin and the lipopolysaccharide test that we do to look at the antibodies against these proteins in the gut that come from a leaky gut we'll do the uh the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where we'll measure the production of fermentation products so hydrogen and methane are gases that are normally produced in the body when people have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth those will be produced at higher levels so we can check that and over time i think the test that we do is a three hour test so you measure baseline hydrogen methane check it at uh intervals of about every half hour and you do that over three hour time period that can tell you definitively do or do you not have uh bacterial overgrowth and how bad is it and is it predominantly hydrogen or is it methyl so what you're saying is that is that when we eat foods you know humans don't produce gas it's the bacteria that are fermenting the foods we eat that produce the gas so absolutely bloated or distended or you're passing gas it's not you you can blame it on the bugs but but the problem is that we don't know how to regulate the bucks bugs and get a healthier ecosystem and that and that is what what most physicians never were trained to do yeah and it's the foundation of functional medicine it's the foundation of our practice here at the ultra chobano center where we really dig into these issues and we look at bacterial overgrowth we look at fungal overgrowth we look at a leaky gut we look at food sensitivities we'll do other testing look at whether you're reacting to gluten or dairy or eggs or other foods and it's really helpful in drilling down on what's really going on with people absolutely yeah and that you know we're talking basically producing gases that's basically a fermentation process and normally fermentation happens lower in the colon that's in the in the colonic area the ant when they it's more of an uh uh what's an anaerobic environment or a lack of oxygen and that's normal for that to be happening but when that process is taking place higher up in a different neighborhood it's not a good thing yeah and i mean you want your upper intestine to be sterile and they're mostly sterile mostly sterile and when and all that bacteria migrates up there it's just a bad situation and when we take acid blockers when we you know are low in magnesium which half of us are when we're under stress and our gut motility is slow when we uh you know taking lots of antibiotics and screws up our whole system in there you know all these are reasons why we get these bacterial overgrowth issues and they're super common and they're easy relatively easy to treat with functional medicine now the other thing we do is look at stool testing right so we look at not just the the proteins from leaky gut or we look at the food sensitivities or bacterial overgrowth gas production but we actually look at the poop yeah so what do we what are we looking for in the poop that helps us figure out what's going on well there's a lot of things uh you know there's gold in there uh there yeah it really is it's uh golden them there hills yeah so a lot of uh information can be uh determined by doing a microbial analysis so you can look at the overall balance of bacteria so there are you know everybody's got hundreds of different kinds of bacteria in the in the gi tract and we can measure those using dna pcr analysis and do we can do quantitative we can measure how many uh there are of each different species look at ones that are normally found look at ones that are found in the gut but normally they want to be at low levels look at bacteria that are associated with autoimmunity so things like citrobacter klebsiella salmonella yeah etc uh we can look at now analyze uh for uh yeast overgrowth various forms of yeast um and then also microbial markers of inflammation things like calprotectin looking for fat so you can get a lot of time functioning enzyme function uh butyrate uh checking for beauty chain factors fatty acids indicators of healthy ecosystems so you know todd what you're what you're saying is that you know traditional sort of microbiome testing they just look at the the genetic material of the the microbiome and they can't really test everything although they can do some really extraordinary tests now but there are kits out there where you can look at your microbiome but it it's far more than just what bugs you have in there it's what they're doing yeah so we look at the the result the function on the ecosystem we look like you said the enzyme function you're absorbing your food is your inflammation are you having good bugs in there that are producing the the super fuel for the gut these short chain fatty acids that are so important oh you do have the right balance i've got are you missing some key bugs you have overgrowth of bad bugs you have yeast you have parasites and it's such a much more comprehensive stool test that we do here at the ultra wellness center we were talking earlier about delta sleep and the interesting thing is is that when you have good bugs in the in the digestive tract and you're eating in a fiber in your diet and you're producing higher levels of butyrate that has an effect on the brain and also improves uh uh sleep that's amazing yeah yeah so you have to have your get your poop together to sleep better i got it okay that's the same that's a good good strategy it's better than taking the ambien yeah um all right so we also look at uh you know other things like omega-3 fats and and other fats because a lot of uh inflammation can come from not having the right balance of fat absolutely in your body yep yeah um and and i think you know so so when you have a patient come in what are the what are the steps you would take initially to treat a patient with rosacea from a functional medicine perspective you know the again taking the history is the big one you know um i always will ask people what's your ethnic background a lot of people say you know i'm white you know it's like you know are you irish english german jewish russian whatever because the rosacea is typically found in in light-skinned fair-skinned people and from a genetic standpoint they are the ones who are more likely to have that it's just an interesting part to know to have in terms of the history and then i'll just ask them you know what is it you're eating are you eating a standard american diet uh how much alcohol are you drinking um how much stress do you have stress also caffeine yeah caffeine can play right yeah those are those are all things which can sort of you know it's like adding gasoline to the fire uh because literally rosacea is the skin on fire in the in the in the uh in the facial area but um doing the testing for essential fatty acids making sure that um uh they have the right balance of the essential fats in their diet a lot of people uh are have too much omega-6 which tends to be more pro-inflammatory yeah lack of the omega 3s one of the oils i don't know if you've used it that i found it very helpful with um patients who have rosacea is uh porridge oil and even criminals oil yeah they tend to be very they help to dampen down that inflammatory resistance that's a very key omega-6 that people don't think about much but it's called gamma linolenic acid which is a very powerful anti-inflammatory it's not like the omega-3s but it's sort of like the omega-3s but on the omega-6 side exactly and it and it's something we really have a hard time getting in our diet it's like borage oil and you know a few other things but evening primrose oil so yeah that's very powerful i agree and i also think that you know um when i see these patients i also think about looking for other clues like do they have yeast issues have they been in lots of antibiotics are they on acid blockers which cause yeast overgrowth yeah do they have other fungal issues dandruff do they have anal itching do they have thrush or a white coating in their tongue uh you know do they have vaginal yeast infections do they have other skin markers of use like little tinea or other kinds of things so you'll see often a pattern of other issues around fungal stuff i'll check for h pylori i'll check again all the tests we did talk about and and see what's really going on and then and then you know from the treatment point of view um you know you start with an elimination diet with an anti-inflammatory diet right exactly yeah put it putting patients on an anti-inflammatory elimination diet you know eighty percent of the time doesn't matter what they come in with they're gonna actually they'll actually get better they you know getting them off of the pro-inflammatory foods uh and then putting in foods which are uh anti-inflammatory uh cold water fish sardines wild salmon um uh the essential oils like uh evening primrose oil helped to sort of dampen down that inflammatory response yeah i agree i think you know we don't understand most of us how powerful food is as medicine and how it can drive tremendous amounts of inflammation throughout the body and you know obviously if it's on your skin it's visible but there's also invisible inflammation that you're not seeing that's driving all the chronic diseases yeah and is that you actually just you just you triggered a thought because there's actually a paper that says if you have rosacea you have a higher instance of alzheimer's disease oh wow so it's not just it's not just a you know a cosmetic issue it's actually systemic it's a rich face and a red brain that's on fire exactly yeah is that yeah that's i i was sort of blown away by that that's fascinating yeah especially in women it's actually more more common in women so so you you know you advise people the obvious things cut out the alcohol the caffeine stay away from the sun it's away from spicy foods but we also sell them stereo from gluten which triggers leaky gut often dairy you you you actually add in all the anti-inflammatory foods that are important though all the phytochemicals from plant foods and turmeric and ginger and garlic and rosemary and all these powerful foods that can really help to reduce inflammation and and then we often directly treat the issues that are going on it could be leaky gut so we give them a gut repair program this could be fungal or bacterial overgrowth so we'll we'll take care of those with either herbs or antibiotics or any fungals and you'll see these patients really dramatically improve when they change their diet and they resort their gut and incentives will use like things like even primrose oil i found the digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid absolutely often are really helpful too yeah i've been so i've been surprised at how many people have a what i would call a relative lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach i i was a venture to say that you know the majority of people don't have too much acid that have not enough acid in the stomach yeah well that's interesting because the third leading category of drugs are the acid blockers like prolossic and prevacid and pepsi pepsi and all these other drugs these uh nexium mass effects i mean they're just like out there everywhere and now they're now they're over the counter and everybody exactly yeah i mean i i just i we've talked about this before in the podcast but when i was in medical school the drug reps came in because it's drugs that just come out and they're like listen guys these guys these drugs work they're they're great uh they will help people with ulcers if they're really bad you don't want to keep anybody on it for more than six weeks right those are huge stomach acid it's really bad long term these are the drug reps telling us this and now it's like people are on it for decades and it causes b12 deficiency magnesium deficiency zinc deficiency osteoporosis osteoporosis pneumonia bacterial overgrowth irritable bowel syndrome when you get rid of your heartburn but you get all the other problems yeah it's yeah that's that's amazing and then it's one of those drugs it's so it's so sneaky because it's addictive once you get on it it's hard to get off it because it it causes this rebound so absolutely when you suppress the stomach acid and you stop the drug the acid production goes crazy exactly which makes you feel horrible and then you go i need the drug but you can actually taper it down and use other strategies to help people get off it and you bring it you bring up a really good point because a lot of the the pharmaceutical medications especially some of the psychotropic so the antidepressants are like that too uh the the ppis and the antidepressants when you try to get off of them you get this rebound process the body tries to get back into balance and it's it can be very difficult so you've got to go low and slow when you're trying to taper off the ppis or taper off uh antidepressant psychotropic meds absolutely amazing so so what what cases have you recalled about rosacea that you want to share that can give you a sense yeah well i i had a patient who came in and um she was a undiagnosed celiac not just a gluten sensitivity she was undiagnosed uh celiac um she was irish and she was having a standard american diet and she was self-medicating for her heartburn with over-the-counter uh acid blocking medications it had a lot of bloating type symptoms and came in uh and you know her her major complaint was her skin but you know she had all these other things but her big thing was you know it's how i look right so you know it's it's you know people are vain and people get people's attention exactly right and and then when i uh did a dive into uh her testing you know it turned out that she was deficient in her essential fatty acids especially the gamma linoleic acid um she she had lack of stomach acid because of the ppis you can actually measure a test blood test is a commercially available test called gastrin and gastrin levels will go up when you block acid um so and that's actually one of the tests that i actually like to use when i have patients when i'm trying to get them off of a ppi because the higher the gastrin level the more difficult it will be to get off the ppi uh and that's sort of like it'll tell you how easy uh you can use blockers exactly and then uh she also had uh low vitamin d levels i mean you know we spend a lot of our time clothed and indoors so we don't get enough way enough enough sunshine uh that's that's one of the big things and low vitamin d you don't just fix low vitamin d this is one of my i get up on my soapbox all the time with here is you don't just fix low vitamin d by taking vitamin d now vitamin d deficiency is basically a sunshine deficiency there are certain times when there can be other causes like you might have fat malabsorption that can cause low vitamin d or you may have problems with the synthesis because of uh lack of skin oils which when you get exposed to the sun but by and large low vitamin d levels is related to sunshine deficiency and it's it's that you know low vitamin d is not the problem it's a symptom of another problem yeah and the immune system is also benefited by sunshine exposure healthy sunshine uh i think you said you're gonna be you enjoy going to the uh the tropics now and then caribbean hawaii whatever and we we also feel good it's also i this is another thing that i find fascinating is that there is a uh uh a condition which is called sunshine addiction you know these people who are like suntan addicts well it turns out that our bodies actually produce um uh endorphins when we are exposed to the sun so there's a feedback mechanism that's incredible yeah yeah it's it's there's a it's a there's a compound it's called pro-opio melanocorticotropin hormone and what it means is that our bodies give a reward when we're in the sun so we feel good we have these feel-good molecules these endorphins uh that make us want to get the sun oh that's interesting that's why i love going in the sun exactly no and then there are these people who i always feel so good when i go to the beach in the summer it just makes me so happy exactly and and the interesting thing is it actually you can get addicted to the sun and that's like it's like you get addicted to food i mean your body needs food to survive and your body actually needs sunshine to survive so our nature has built in these feedback mechanisms so that it we encourages us to do it that's incredible yeah i don't know why so what happened with this patient uh what did you do for her well i did a lot i mean i had her work with our nutritionist and got her off of her standard american diet i treated her bacterial overgrowth she had a significant sibo test so i treated that primarily with herbs a lot of people will use antibiotics things like rifaximin or xifaxim for sibo i actually find that i do just as well using antimicrobial herb preparations i supported her stomach acid using betaine hcl uh some patients don't respond to that they they don't tolerate as well so sometimes i'll use things like apple cider vinegar and then uh got her fatty acids up gave her a little bit of borage oil and you know a combination of that and then also just told her to get some healthy sunshine uh it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to go out and sunbathe or go to a sun tanning booth but just getting healthy sunshine can help with down regulating the immune system yeah um and interestingly you know just off topic but with covid there are some really interesting studies that giving high-dose vitamin d helps with uh covet infections absolutely and and so covet actually or vitamin d uh when it's at high enough levels actually helps to keep the immune system in balance it keeps it from getting yeah it controls hundreds of genes it regulates immunity and inflammation it's pretty amazing it's not really a vitamin it's more like a hormone exactly exactly it's like a hormone and it's also it actually likes this acts like a steroid too it's it's a it's a cholesterol molecule moiety and uh um i often times when if i'm getting coming down with a cold or flu i'll up my dosage especially in the winter absolutely it's true and i when i feel like something's coming on and i take like fifty thousand units for three or four days and yeah i never i never get sick yeah it goes away by the next morning it is it's pretty powerful so so todd we've just covered a lot here and i i recall a lot of cases of mine that have had rosacea it's always one of those things where i love seeing because it's so easy to treat and people suffer so much from it and just by following the functional medicine approach looking at the root causes treating the skin from the inside out addressing the gut addressing food sensitivities addressing nutritional deficiencies which is really the foundations of functional medicine these people get better and we we don't just take it at face value but we we actually go under the hood and look at what's going on exactly you know i think there was one great quote i heard somewhere that traditional medicine is like uh trying to diagnose uh what's wrong with your car by listening to the noises it makes instead of looking under the hood exactly and functional medicine is about looking under the hood absolutely and here at the ultra wellness center in lenox massachusetts we've been doing this for decades we have the most incredible team here who collectively have probably 70 years of clinical experience in functional medicine and we're doing most of our care virtually now so wherever you live in the world we can take care of it using virtual zoom consults and uh it's pretty gratifying to see how many people are taking advantage of that and getting better uh and and uh i think that uh you know this is a this is a challenging moment for everybody and i think we we often neglect our own health and our own health care uh nobody wants to go to the doctor nobody wants to go to the hospital anymore but but i think you know people can get virtual care now which is super awesome and uh and we invite you to check it out you go to ultrawellnesscenter.com uh if you're suffering from any skin disorder whether it's acne or acne rosacea or eczema or psoriasis we've had some podcasts on that go listen to them but this is really uh an approach that works for skin disorders i love skin problems because they are so easy to treat whether like i said it's eczema acne rosacea whatever it is it's pretty striking and and it's just heartbreaking to see how many patients struggle with these conditions because they're often so embarrassing that's one thing if you have you know bacterial overgrowth and bloating you're the only one who knows your stomach exploded right but if you've got this nasty looking face or skin issues you don't want to be seen like that and i think this is it affects people's uh sense of well-being and their self-worth and absolutely and i just want to know there is really clear approaches that help this yeah and the exciting thing is is is it's a lot of the conferences that i go to there are now functional medicine dermatologists who get it you know because most dermatologists do not realize or remember that the skin and the gut are contiguous they are connected so when you have a skin problem it's oftentimes an internal problem yeah and the functional medicine dermatologists which are um you know growing um are getting that and they're really helpful yeah i agree it is one of the most exciting parts of functional medicine is dermatology because it's like it's like oh it's such a slam dunk yeah and and uh there are a number of really great functional medicine doctors out there who are dermatologists and and you know the stories are amazing i just i just uh you know see so many people suffer on this unnecessary unnecessarily exactly yeah so if you've been loving this podcast and you know someone with a skin problem or you've got a skin problem come see us here share with your friends and family on social media leave a comment we'd love to hear how you've addressed your skin issues what's worked what hasn't worked subscribe

        "transcript": "[Music] hey guys so if you have watched my story then you know about like all of my skin issues and things like that i recently just did a post on my instagram about rosacea please read the caption and then there's another bit in the comments because it was a long caption um but please read that before this video because that's the background of figuring out what kind of rosacea you have and how it's triggered to how we're gonna treat it and this video is how i've been treating it myself to the point that it's literally ninety percent better i get a flare up like maybe once a week and i can pinpoint it down to what food it was that gave it to me but something that really kills me that i just want to quickly touch on is the fact that the diagnosis is incurable it is just the worst feeling when someone tells you that something that's wrong with you that not only is painful but is also just controls your life because it's emotionally exhausting feeling like your cheeks are on fire and burning at random times of the day and just can't figure out why but being told it's incurable is so daunting so upsetting and also when you're 23 you don't want to be told you have an incurable disease so for everyone that's watching this i don't know your situation i don't know what kind of rosacea you have but i know the way that that diagnosis made me feel and i just want to be here to tell you that there are ways to treat it i don't believe it's incurable i believe anything that can get into the body can get out and i just want to tell you that i am here with you on this journey i got told i had rosacea acne which basically is a type of rosacea that goes really really red and burny and then comes out in these little posturals that are usually white filled kind of like acne that was two years ago the acne is so much better like so much better but i still do get malaysia every now and then when i first started with rosacea i had it every day if you watch my first ever video on youtube you'll see this but i couldn't leave the house it was summer in l.a and i was there with my boyfriend and i would sit and i would cry because literally my cheeks felt like they were burning off and anyone that has rosacea knows this feeling and it's exhausting and it's not just blushing like it's red and it hurts like it's inflammation it's heat literally ruined my self-confidence because whenever i'd go to work any makeup that i put on oh my gosh the red would just start coming through i swear my face would start melting not even kidding so that was when i went on my mission with my health and i started with the herbs for my skin and my acne but the rosacea was still always under lying and i just couldn't figure out why and it just didn't make any sense to me the way that i treated my rosacea first things first please figure out what kind of rosacea you have because there's lots of different ones and not everyone's treatment is going to be the same number one i figured out the trigger so my trigger is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so that is basically where bacteria has crawled up into the small intestine where it's definitely not meant to be it's meant to be in our large intestine when our gut gets all trashed from me taking a bazillion antibiotics and all different medications that's what happens they go looking for a new home that is more habitable that is like hawaii in the summertime they're like i'm gonna live in the small intestine so that's what they do and they're not meant to be there so that means when you eat certain foods which is a lot of foods you get bloating you get gas you get constipation sometimes diarrhea swapping routine all too sorry for the information you look like you're six months pregnant and that's kind of that and it's painful again and then after the bloating you get the rosacea and mine usually starts just here on this cheek and it goes to my chin and then if it's really bad it goes on my whole face and my chest i'm always a little bit red here if you can see which i think it's actually stress i need to go and meditate basically i figured out that mine was linked to sibo now if you look at dr amy myers she's awesome and a lot of other doctors that i've actually personally worked with they talk about the sibo rosacea connection and what that basically means is when your small intestine is aggravated all the different foods that like you're eating that is interacting with the sibo it creates heat and heat travels upwards it also creates damp and we don't want heat and damp which is what a lot of us have in our bodies that lead to a lot of different skin conditions traveling up and coming out of our skin also have to remember that our skin is a detox organ your body is in this constant state of like this isn't how it's meant to be so i want to push it out and if it can't push it out through acne if it's not bacteria if it's just heat it's literally just going to travel up and it's going to push it out any way that they can and unfortunately that's usually out of our face so my biggest tips for rosacea number one cut all fragrance preservatives out of your skincare you guys have noticed recently that i have been trying different skincare that was because i wanted to try a skincare with no preservatives the reason i haven't posted about it is because i want to see if it genuinely works for my skin and what is best for me before i start recommending things the second thing is what are you eating 45 more likely to have sibo if you have rosacea so if i was you i'd probably go get a test and you know they do breath tests and super helpful and then with sibo they always suggest low fodmap they are foods that are basically super super easy on your digestion that are going to cause less irritation specifically for the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth the next thing that i find super super super important is i get triggered if i'm in a really stale room where there's smoke if i'm cooking just make sure you have a window open smoke is such a massive irritant for me it's so frustrating the next thing is stress when we get stressed and we produce cortisol which is the bug bear of most of our health problems all that does is create more internal heat mess with our other hormones and create more rosacea stress is such a massive trigger which is hard because we are in a society that most of time is quite stressful so i find meditation has literally saved the game for me and the last thing is rosacea when i work with my kinesiologists and love other spiritual beautiful beings in my life rosacea has a direct connection to holding onto emotions so it is not a coincidence that when i got my rosacea yes it's it's gut related but it's also fueled by emotion it is not a coincidence that i went through a breakup that just like shook me had family stuff going on was sick and was also just traveling like not figuring out what i was doing and i was holding in so much hurt from friendships from ex-partners from family stuff everything going on it is not a coincidence and people are like i don't know i didn't have rosacea and now i do it's like what has happened in your life and not just physically mentally like what has happened to you recently like we all go through things everyone has a story everybody has their [\u00a0__\u00a0] like what are you actually holding on to in here like right in this little spot where i feel like all my anxiety is rosacea can often manifest as anger that's the most common one with holding anger feeling like you can't express your anger withholding your anger just bottling it up another one can be resentment if you are resenting someone that's why when people say like forgiveness is the best medicine you don't have to forget but to forgive not for them because they did you wrong but for yourself forgive for yourself let that go because all it's going to do is eat you up inside and give you more resection the next one is self-loathing so i genuinely ever since this got brought to my attention i genuinely can see when i'm having a bad body image day or just a bad day or a day where like i just want to have a meltdown which like we all have those days health stuff can be really overwhelming but like when i'm having a really bad day about like self-worth or body image i'm fine but whenever i'm having days like that i can let you feel the hate coming up now it's insane and let's see how red i am now um yeah so self-loathing and low self-worth is a direct connection to your rosacea and it could be from like when you're a child it could be from when you're a teenager it could be things that have bottled up and it triggers hit like you took a bazillion pills that you shouldn't have or you got sick or you got run down or you went through something you went through a trauma and it could just trigger that rosacea is so connected to the way that we feel it's insane and acne yes as well i truly believe acne is like trying to teach us about our barriers our skin is a physical barrier to our body and trying to teach us to implement our own emotional physical mental barriers and the same with rosacea it's trying to teach us something and that's why i know it sucks but everything in this life is here to teach you something and the only way you can really heal rosacea is if you start healing your mental health i'm gonna go back on it again but like really think into it or go and see someone don't be afraid to go and see someone like just to go in and be like okay i'm ready to release this built up anger or resentment or you know self-loathing i'm ready to feel good about myself i'm really ready to release this heat and this these demons that are sitting inside me so those are my biggest tips for rosacea like no fragrance no preservatives in your skincare or your makeup that's a big one with diet looking into sibo looking into low fodmap eating and healing your gut lining healing your leaky gut is definitely massive i can give you a list of foods if you want but if you just google low fodmap it will all be there dr amy myers is super helpful anything inflammatory it's an inflammatory condition so gluten dairy processed foods sugars all of those things are not going to make it any better interesting for me the correlation between the temperature of my food and rosacea actually isn't that significant yes i can feel if i'm in a hot room and i have a hot soup i get hot but that's kind of normal that's kind of what happens to all of us for me it's actually the food that i'm eating i can eat something cold like be a yogurt that has probiotics in it and i'll get rosacea that's another thing if you have sibo probiotics for me any kind of probiotic currently still makes me worse you have to kind of clear out the old before you can go in with the new or they all start having a fight so that's the other thing be really careful with probiotics but yeah those are my biggest tips emotions and rosacea are so related i can't express it enough there's a reason that i cleared my acne because i put barriers in my life and i don't allow myself to be mistreated anymore but there's a reason why i still am clearing my rosacea it's like 90 better reason still there is because i'm still clearing these emotions but well where i've come from like the personal growth that i have been through is incredible so pat on the back so those are my biggest tips for rosacea i have almost healed myself if i can you can as well i know people that live with it for 30 years and they've healed their gut they've healed their sibo they've implemented the low inflammatory foods they've changed their skin care change their makeup and they are living a normal life and you can too if i can clear my acne i can clear my rosacea i did it all naturally and you can as well i love you guys you guys are amazing i really hope that i have helped in any way that i can i will do an updated makeup video because why not and i know you guys are always so interested to see my hair's growing back we love that but yeah just don't let it beat you and please please please if you take anything from this video it's just to work on you and work on your mental health because that is where this is all bestering from i guarantee when i clear that last little bit of resentment and pain and anger out of my little solar plexus i generally don't think i'll have rosacea ever again no matter what food i eat and my guts so much better so love you guys you are amazing never forget that your skin doesn't define you but i also know how frustrating it can be and how much it runs your life so have a beautiful day check in again on here soon",

        "transcript": "would you believe me if i tell you that the mites on your face are causing these red angry looking bums also known as rosacea hi friends i'm chris and i'm a dermatology trainee working in the west of scotland in the uk and in this video i'm going to dive straight into the topic rosacea specifically we're going to cover what it is how it looks like as well as the various steps and treatments we can do to help prevent and manage this common skin condition we are also going to touch on the things that you can do to help with your skin as well as the various treatment options we have in dermatology in the uk so what on earth is rosacea well this is a very common skin condition predominantly affecting the middle age groups as well as people with fair skin we don't exactly know what causes this but it is thought to be due to a combination of genes environmental factors as well as an overabundance of a type of mite also known as the demodex mites now these are small little creatures that love growing and crawling around the hair follicles and it's actually present in every single one of us however in people with rosacea it is thought that they are more sensitive to these mites and thereby causing inflammation of the skin leading to flushing and redness rosacea can also be triggered by a variety of things which i've listed in this video and the most common trigger that we see in our clinics is actually direct sunlight and this is why we always advise our patients to wear sunscreen at all times to help prevent rosacea there are of course other known triggers such as caffeine in your tea coffee alcohol spicy food and even exercise and it's actually really anything that makes your blood vessels beneath the skin dilate causing the flushing and redness you see in rosacea now i think it's important for us to classify the rosacea into various subtypes as they can look quite different and also the treatments for each subtype can be different as well one of the commonest subtype of rosacea is the erythematolangitic rosacea also known as the vascular rosacea this can be quite a mouthful to pronounce but essentially patients presents with flushing redness of the face and telangiectasia which also means dilated blood vessels now the flushing is usually temporary at the start but as the rosacea worsens it can become permanent the other very common subtype of rosacea is the papillopascillar rosacea also known as the inflammatory rosacea and in this subtype patients get this angry looking red bumps also known as papules and pasteurs which are essentially papules containing parts inside now i think it is important for us to identify papillopascular variant of rosacea as they can look quite similar to acne vulgaris and so you may ask how do i actually tell the difference well essentially the triggers for rosacea don't necessarily exacerbate acne the other important thing to note is that the lesions for rosacea typically affect the central face so this would include the forehead both cheeks the nose and the chin and they typically spare the temples and the sides of the jawline of the face lastly in rosacea we don't normally get the white or blackheads that you see in acne and these are also known as comedomes which are basically clogged up hair follicles now the other two subtypes are not as common but we do still see them in our practice one of them is called the ocular rosacea and as the name suggests ocular meaning eye patients with this type of rosacea typically get eye symptoms such as burning itching and grittiness of the eyes and if this is left unchecked and untreated it can cause permanent scarring and so it is important for you to seek help quite early on so that you can get the appropriate management the last subtype is the phymatus rosacea also known as rhinophyma now this subtype is particularly difficult to treat and essentially means thickening and deformity of the skin particularly affecting the nose so your usual creams gels lotion and potions that you use to treat rosacea probably wouldn't work for this subtype of rosacea and you may need more aggressive treatments like laser therapies and even surgery so now you may ask how do we treat rosacea the important thing for any subtype of rosacea is to identify and potentially avoid or limit any triggers triggering rosacea what i'll recommend is to keep a diary for anything that can exacerbate your rosacea and try to limit or cut down one trigger at a time you don't have to be prescriptive about this because ultimately it is your quality of life we are talking about and it's all about weighing the pros and cons when it comes to avoiding things you may like so for example if your rosacea is triggered by eating spicy food and you just so happen to love spicy food and you eat spicy food every single time it is probably quite difficult and even impossible for you to limit eating spicy food because it will just make you very miserable so instead of avoiding things completely you may wish to perhaps limit the amount of exposure and be more rigorous when it comes to your skin care regime another important thing you can do is to treat your skin as though it is super sensitive always always remember to wear a good sunscreen as we know sunlight is the number one trigger for rosacea wearing sunscreen not only prevents rosacea it also helps reduce the risk of skin cancer and slows down aging another tip is to use non-fragrance and non-comedogenic facial cleansers and moisturizers which help protect the skin berry function try to find cleansers that are more acidic with a ph similar to the skin so between four to five rather than harsh soaps which are more alkaline and can be quite irritating and traumatic to the skin an example you can try is the serraphy hydrating facial cleanser another important tip is to keep your skin care as simple as possible now for patients who have sensitive skin who are more prone to getting acne and rosacea i would advise against using toner because toner can actually strip off the essential oils and moisture in your skin making it more inflamed so for specific subtypes like for example the erythematologic rosacea other than the advice that i've given before and doctors in the uk can also prescribe a topical gel called movaso gel which contains bromonidin 0.03 now this is licensed and indicated for facial redness and flushing and we typically advise patients to use once a day the only issue with this gel is that it can cause rebound redness when it's stopped and so it's often quite difficult when patients try to come off it another treatment that we can offer in the uk is an oral medication called propranolol which helps to shrink down any dilated blood vessels now as you can imagine this is an oral tablet so it can cause systemic side effects such as slowing your heart rate down and so this is something that we don't normally prescribe in the uk for rosacea unless it is absolutely crucial also if your facial redness is permanent causing discomfort and psychological distress sometimes we can think of laser treatments for example ipl and housed dye laser the only thing is that i'm not exactly sure if these treatments are still available under the nhs which is the national health service for those people living in the uk as such and you may wish to consider going for these treatments privately but make sure that you seek out a reputable and recognized healthcare professional who knows what they are doing you may also wish to consider camouflage makeup with a green tinted base to help correct the redness and help even out the skin tone now in the uk there is a camouflage service provided by a charity called changing faces and this is something that you can register either yourself or get your gp to refer you onwards to this service and in this service what they do is that they would look at your skin tone show you the products that they use the different shades that would match your skin tone as well as how to apply the products now for people who are suffering from the papillopascular type of rosacea we do have a variety of treatments available for people who are suffering from mild to moderate symptoms we can offer topical treatments in the first instance and in the uk there are three mainstay topical treatments we offer the first one is ivamatin cream also known as cilantra which you can apply once a day to the affected areas for up to four months the other treatment is metronidazole gel also known as rosex gel which you can apply twice daily for up to four months and lastly we have the acelic acid 15 cream with the brand name being called phoenicia and we often ask patients to apply to their face twice a day for up to six months these treatments are typically prescribed by your healthcare professional in the uk but i think you can get the acelic acid treatments over the counter through brands like the ordinary products choice as well as natural once the rosacea is more well controlled you can then reduce the frequency down to once or twice a week as a form of maintenance therapy if your symptoms are more severe then we may consider a combination of oral antibiotic and the topical treatments and the oral antibiotics include things like lemon cycline and doxycycline now bear in mind this is a prescription only medication and so you may wish to speak to your healthcare professional like your gp or local dermatologist in your area to find out more the aim of using antibiotics is more for the anti-inflammatory properties rather than antibacterial and typically patients stay on the antibiotics for at least three months for it to actually work now if the symptoms continue to be persistent despite topical and oral antibiotics sometimes in dermatology we offer low-dose isotretinoin also known as roaccotin now this is a treatment similar to that for acne severe acne in fact but actually the dose used for rosacea is much lower than that used for acne now as for people suffering from the phymatis variant of rosacea and the topical treatments and as well as the or antibiotics they won't work because of the deformity and soft tissue swelling in this case sometimes we can refer you onwards to laser treatments as well as surgical interventions to help remove the excess soft tissue and as far as i know these services are still available in some health boards across the uk so you may wish to speak to your local dermatologist to find out more now for people who are suffering from eye symptoms or ocular rosacea other than minimizing the aggravating factors like for example excessive central heating excessive air conditioning and even smoky environments i think it is important for you to make sure that you keep your eyelids as clean as possible this means cleaning them with a cotton wool soaked in warm water and if you get sticky bits underneath your eyelids you can wash them with using baby shampoo also if your eyes get dry you can buy over the counter lubricating eye drops and try to go for the ones without preservatives to keep your eyes moisturized throughout the day one thing that people don't realize is that sometimes medications can exacerbate eye dryness so have a look at your regular medications particularly if you are on a lot of regular medications such as certain antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications as they can sometimes exacerbate eye dryness in dermatology we sometimes use all antibiotics to help dampen down inflammation but if your eye symptoms are very bad and severe we can refer to our ophthalmology colleagues in the eye clinic for their review as well now before i close off this video i just want to say that oftentimes we underestimate how distressing skin conditions can be for people i know that it is not the same as say if someone suffers a stroke or a heart attack rosacea is not life-threatening but they can cause a huge impact on our daily activities and social life skin conditions can make you look and feel different from the people around you and this ultimately can cause you to lose confidence in yourself and cause self-esteem issues i just want to say that for anyone who is watching this video suffering from any skin condition no matter how severe or mild it may be and if you are suffering from this and please don't suffer this alone speak to someone about it and get help as soon as possible there are tons of support groups online and that can help support you through this journey i myself suffered from really bad severe acne and this had caused significant long-term scarring which i still have to this day and so i hope by doing these videos i would empower you guys including healthcare professionals and with the necessary tools and knowledge in tackling of these skin conditions at an early stage i will also provide several links down in the description box below which you may want to check out if you want to read out more about rosacea and if you're interested to know more about skin conditions in general do check out my video on keratosis polaris where i talk about another very common skin condition that pretty much almost everyone suffers from thank you for watching see you later bye",

        "transcript": "hi everyone thanks for watching today's video I am going to share with you all my personal experience with rosacea kind of what it is exactly causes and treatments and how to just keep it under control so if you're interested in learning more please continue to watch so as you can see I have no makeup on my face right now and I have rosacea on my cheeks it started off on my right cheek about three years ago and it just kind of started spreading and getting worse and now I'm starting to feel it on my left cheek it's very minimal on this side but I do see it starting to expand now please keep in mind I am NOT a medical professional this information is all based off my personal experience in research that I've done myself and information that my dermatologist has provided for me I am NOT diagnosing anybody I am not advising you to try my specific routine as it works for me but I am trying to just let you know that this is a thing and it's super common and normal there are different types of rosacea um but it's different for everybody some people have acne prone rosacea some people just have really red flared skin like myself there's severe cases there's not so severe cases it's just really depends on the person we all have imperfections and all that matters is that you're healthy at the end of the day there are things and procedures that one can do to perfect their skin but it just it is what it is we're human beings and not everything is gonna be perfect my skin I'm totally comfortable with it it was definitely something that I had to adjust to in terms of what I'm paying attention to now more as far as moisturizers cleansers what I'm eating things that I'm putting on my face especially as a makeup artist so I'm always trying new things so I had to adjust in that aspect but accepting the fact that I had it and after I learned about what it really was I'm just grateful that it's not a severe case and you know it just it is what it is to give you just a general overview of what it is it's basically just a skin condition it's an inflammatory skin condition that mostly comes and appears on one's face on their cheeks if you can't tell where I have it around their nose or even on their eyes so there are four types of rosacea the first type of rosacea I'm going to attempt to say this word I'm not a doctor there is an acronym and we will stick to those but it's called our thematic LAN Jie ACK tactic rosacea also known as ETR let's stick to that this type of rosacea is really just the flushing of the face where you really see those popped blood vessels appear on the cheeks it's just some people think it's like it looks good because it look that you have blush on others may not think so this is the one that I have there is no acne really on my skin it's just flared up and flamed redness and blood vessels all over the second type of rosacea is PAP EULA stealer rosacea acne rosacea also known as inflammatory rosacea this one is more acne prone so those individuals who have more acne as well as redness this is really bad category that you're in the third type is rhinophyma rosacea this specific kind it really results to like thickening and redness around the skin mainly so you built that build up around the skin as well as blood vessels really airs around the nose area finally the fourth one is ocular rosacea and this one is mainly focused around the eye area and hangs out around there if you have like a lot more swollen red eyes if you see people who have like if it looks like that they're irritated or super sensitive or like watery a lot of the times that's ocular rosacea so how do you know you have ETR rosacea which is what I have first things first flushing and redness that's really what's gonna drive all of it I notice the spots and it just kind of grew from there if you use those mirrors I like to zoom into your face and like they're just like it shows all your imperfections you can see like broken blood vessels inside your skin and that also is a red flag as far as maybe having rosacea something else that it does it swells your skin so when it's irritated my cheek gets really really swollen and I can definitely tell because I just I'm like it blows up and it's bothered burning stinging just sensitive skin as a whole really flares it my skin used to be very very oily and after I started experiencing this condition it is dry so dry on my cheek it feels like snake skin it's flaky it feels tough and like it's just rough and the texture is so different compared to my other cheek because it's just it feels like it's broken I developed this condition about three years ago and I first started noticing it when I was doing laser hair removal on my face so if you're familiar with laser hair removal you normally have to shave the area prior to the treatment so I was doing my face and I had to shave I hated that but because it kind of makes your skin rough so I started to exfoliate after as you're told to do so but I think that started to really irritate my skin so it wasn't until like the third or fourth session that I realized I was developing a lot of red blood vessels on my right cheek and it was very minimal like this picture it started to develop and grow more and three years later it's all over my cheek and now I'm starting to feel it on the left cheek as well and I see a few spots and I'm not sure eventually it'll start to move around in the area it never used to bother me up until maybe like my second year when it started to spread I started to feel a lot of burning sensations on my cheek every now and then it comes in waves but I started to feel like my face was just on fire and it started to really get inflamed and I then seeked guidance from a dermatologist at that point I learned that the cause of rosacea is pretty much unknown there are things I can trigger it but the overall core reason is still unknown and it just kind of develops and it's so common because over 3 billion people have it it's really also not a specific cure to rosacea there are workarounds as to how you can control it which is what I'm learning but there is no common cure when I met my my dermatologist she mentioned that luckily and gratefully I was a very very I was at a very early stage where it was not severe or critical or needed to even be treated they do have antibiotics and topical creams for folks that are like more in the acne stage to kind of comment down but in this case and in the case that I was they mentioned that antibiotics are not necessary topical creams are not necessary and really I just should be paying attention as to what triggers it and how to comment down now there are things that you can do as far as the appearance of rosacea that are cosmetic like you can get skin laser like acne scar removal and things like that I believe I've never done that maybe down the line depending on like the stage as I'm in with it or if it does get worse I may look into it but because my skin is already so sensitive I just the less is more as far as causes now there are a lot of different things that can cause rosacea the biggest thing we always want to pay attention to is what we're putting inside of our body that's always gonna reflect our external appearance because what we're putting in internally it has a huge effect on what's showing out here I realized that I was drinking a lot of coffee at a very hot temperature caffeine triggers rosacea you definitely want to avoid it it's something that I can't live without so I try I have to cut down a lot of it I switched to iced coffee because I learned that the temperature and if I was drinking hot tea or coffee or even hot soup my skin would start to flare up so about and I would feel like it was on fire there are also certain foods that you want to start paying attention to as far as what you are eating just like they say greens are good for us internally well they're just as good for us externally vegetables is key anything green will really help balance your skin as well as hydration you need to make sure you're hydrated I can't stress this enough I am a person who had the law the hardest time drinking water and like I have to get into like habit but after I started drinking lots of water my skin start to feel a lot more normal as well as internally I felt great you have to make sure you're hydrated you will see your skin break out you will see a lot of different things happen to your body if you're not hydrated there are other types of foods that we eat that can cause rosacea such as spicy foods drinking alcohol Dairy citrus even sweets like chocolate the best thing to do in this case if you're unfamiliar with what's causing it is keep a skin diary and just jot down what you ate that day that may be triggered your skin or inflamed it and started feeling irritated that's how you can start to get familiar with what to eat and what not to eat and that's what really helped me I would just keep it on my notes on my phone and I started to realize like oh god I can't eat spicy food I can't drink coffee this is what's bothering me and there's also other reasons why one can develop rosacea and that is stress stress is something that we can't avoid as a human being you know sometimes we're stressing and we don't even know we're stressing now while learning about rosacea and doing research I realized that there were a lot of things that we have to avoid if we have the skin issue for example you don't want to exfoliate I was exfoliating using Murad and it made my skin really soft especially when I was beginning to feel like the flaky toughness I like the way the exfoliator made my skin feel like that next hour but when I would wake up in the morning my skin would be very very irritated so you do not want to exfoliate also I used to use witch hazel toner for the longest time after I would do my cleanser in the morning and at night I realized that you don't want to use toner it basically scrapes your skin off and it's it's harsh to the skin so as a rosacea candidate you want to avoid toner all the time I spoke to my dermatologist and she told me to stick to just cleansing and moisturizing as far as my day-to-day skincare routine and that's it now let's jump into my current skincare routine as a rosacea candidate I have a different process now in my skincare that I'll share with you but it's very easy if you have rosacea especially ETR like I do that condition you want to just look forwards when you're buying skincare products such as gentle hydrating skin balance moisture first things first I wipe off my makeup with any micellar water this is from Garnier and it works really really well it's just drugstore brand and I also use Bioderma that brand if you don't want to use garni air I highly recommend that one it never irritates my skin and it feels really hydrating I wipe my face off with this to kind of get as much makeup off as possible and then I'll dive in with my cleanser for cleanser I use CeraVe this is the best also these are all drugstore brands which is crazy because I used to buy like top-notch all these expensive things and they ended up just screwing me over because my skin was just like nah but anyway CeraVe is from Target and you can honestly find anywhere but this is hydrating as you can see the word hydrating this has hyaluronic acid in it so it helps balance out the moisture in your skin as well as it's free it's free so it doesn't have any extra chemicals in there that'll bother your skin and it doesn't clog your pores so that's really really helpful I washed my face with this day and night you want to make sure you're cleansing at least twice even three times a day your face carries so much bacteria even if you walk outside which I know right now we're not walking outside cuz we're sheltered at home by the way I hope everyone's safe and healthy but yeah this you want to company you want to cleanse your face as much as possible because no bacteria should be on here I moisturize and I also use CeraVe therapy I don't know this is just the daily moisturizer and I put it on day and and it has SPF in it but if you want to in addition add your own SPF sunblock definitely do so you should be wearing SPF if you have rosacea particular any heat attraction to your skin is going to affect it and inflame it so obviously it's like a burn on your face wear sunblock or try to find moisturizer that has a built in in it I used to use the Mario Badescu rose water the pink one and I started using the facial spray that is cucumber and green anything aloe cucumber green tea is gonna sit well with your rosacea issues love this stuff it's just you can put it on anytime and it just feels so good this is my skin care procedure day and night but throughout the week there are some things that I do here and there like a face mask that's hydrating because my face is very dry I just keep it simple I don't do too much remember less is more as a rosacea candidate and I just buy these Sephora face masks this blue one is aloe vera and this green one is green tea so anything aloe vera green tea is gonna be your best friend these feel good and so far I have not had any reactions to my film about once a week I've been doing them for a few weeks now and I wake up and my skin feels really refreshed helps really soothe and calm down your face - after a long day especially if it's irritated so these masks are simple but if you are gonna use this face mask stay away from my charcoal stay away from anything that is like exfoliating stick to hydrating and calm and nourishing face masks that are potentially green tea or aloe vera or cucumber as far as makeup goes you want to stick to clean type products things that don't contain like wykel acid menthol witch hazel alcohol those things are really gonna trigger your skin so anything clean organic vegan those types of foundations and concealers tend to sit better with your skin I know it cosmetics has a lot Clinique definitely dedicates a lot towards rosacea they have a lot of products that help anything with redness you can also want to stick to oil-free because those contain a lot of those acids in it that will overall just I know it helps the appearance of the look but it overall really triggers your skin so pay attention to your skin pay attention to what you're eating pay attention to what you are putting on your skin there is a lot of information out there but you need to know what works best for you it's not the end of the world it is not contagious it is not an illness it's just it is what it is the truth of the matter is that the condition is unknown and over three billion people in the world have it so if you think you're the only one you are not and take care of it before it gets worse oh I hope this helps and let me if you do have rosacea and there are things that you do that help you I'd love to learn more I'm constantly researching this as my skin changes and I'm growing and it's developing um but share your your secrets and insights as far as what you do that helps oh yeah that's it I hope you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up like share and subscribe and until next time I'll see you later",

        "transcript": "hey guys I'm dr. Mona GU Hara and welcome back to another episode of dear derm today we're going to talk all about rosacea [Music] so rest assured that I see rosacea patients every single day it is super super common so you are not alone but sometimes you may not think it's rosacea and patients come in and they say doctor Kihara I really sensitive skin when actually that's not what's going on but that doesn't mean we're not going to talk about it today I'm deer derm we're gonna dig in a little bit deeper and talk about the different kinds of rosacea and what skincare routine would be optimal for you if you think you have it [Music] rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that a lot of people associate with redness on the face but it can actually present itself in many different ways so let's get into that a little bit more so there's four different things that I kind of talk about my patience with and people can have any variation of that first trigger-based flushing so hotter spicy food red wine changes of emotion changes of temperature I hate to use the word both hormonal flushing and the face gets a little bit pink in the cheeks and then the flushing goes back down second is textural changes on the skin so acne bumps enlarged pores dryness easily irritated any of those things where the texture of your skin is noticeably different may actually be a component of rosacea and what's interesting is you actually may see these textural changes which kind of look like pimples around your chin nose and eyes third you may see broken capillaries little tiny broken blood vessels in the skin that actually leave the skin looking a little bit pink and red and somebody may think for example you've been sunburned or have a little blush on when actually you don't and then lastly ocular rosacea or rosacea around the eye that leaves the eye watery feeling a little bit gritty like you want to dig something out of there each one of these components of rosacea has a nuance treatment that your dermatologist may talk to you about that being said anyone with rosacea really should consider using a very gentle skin care routine on a daily basis [Music] when I talk to patients about what they should be using on their face in the context of rosacea the first would start with a very gentle hydrating cleanser no harsh soaps nothing that's foaming nothing that's drying because what that's gonna do is it's just gonna stoke the fire creating more redness second when it comes to exfoliation I recommend using a beta hydroxy acid like salicylic acid instead of an alpha hydroxy acid like glycolic acid why because it's a little less irritating and also it can help minimize the enlarged pores which often come along with the textural changes of rosacea moisturization is essential because patients with rosacea may note that they have particularly dry skin so I recommend looking for creams and lotions that have components like ceramides glycerin and hyaluronic acid lastly and probably most importantly is sun protection and ultraviolet protection because we know that UV light and heat can be a very big trigger for rosacea flares so I recommend to my patients that they never leave the house before applying a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher if you're interested in collagen building or fading down fine lines here are some of the ingredients that I like the Cuchillo is a plant-based ingredient that's been used in many other parts of the world to bring out radiance and glow and increase collagen production and it's extremely gentle on the skin also I really like a vitamin a derivative called ret and aldehyde which helps to build collagen but is a lot less inflammatory than other retinoids [Music] so here are some of the things that I recommend avoiding when you're applying makeup I wouldn't use the harsh bristly brushes this is a great place for the makeup sponge to blend in your foundation or to put on your concealer because they're a lot less irritating to the skin and may not bring out that redness that can be triggered by irritation on the skin I also recommend avoiding mechanical cleansing brushes and mechanical exfoliants because they can actually make you have more broken capillaries on the skin so I would just steer clear of those altogether and then the last thing I would say is just be overall very careful of what you're putting on the skin it kind of takes some examination before you buy a product just because it says natural or organic or plant-based doesn't mean it's great for the skin and it actually may be pro-inflammatory [Music] so here are some specific product lines that I like for rosacea for sunscreen I like the elta MD line they have a wonderful product called Alta clear that you can put on each morning before you leave the house and as the clear and the name connotes it blends in easily with any skin routine but it also has this little magic gem of niacinamide in it that helps to reduce inflammation so that's one of my fan favorites when it comes to rosacea products I also like this line called a vent which is in general which is very gentle on the skin for those of you interested in collagen production and decreasing fine line this product here which is active ingredient is retinaldehyde is a gem just use a pea-sized amount over the entire face to get your desired result now one of the tips and tricks I tell my patients is actually just to apply it to the periphery of the face not the central face because the outside of your face is where you'll have the least amount of inflammation from rosacea but most of those pesky little lines another product line I love which is from Spain is called isdon't you can find it locally here in the US and this in particular this line in particular called mell atonic is infused with the coochie all that plant-based derivative that we talked about and it's very gentle I really love this because it's a serum base and I can and I like that it's clear as you can see and I like that I could use it in the morning or at night giving me a little bit more flexibility in my routine so I actually use this on a regular basis because I myself had of a smidge of rosacea that's trigger based for my feet so when I get out of the shower my face is a little flushed and I just put on my mellow tonic [Music] now that you have the general skincare routine for rosacea let's talk about the specific treatments that I may recommend to my patients so first for trigger-based flushing and I know this is SuperDuper annoying what I usually recommend to avoid the triggers the second component of rosacea that we talked about which is the textural changes or the acne bumps that may occur around the mouth the nose or the eyes eye there are a lot of options for this there could be topical or oral antibiotics that can come in the form of creams or pills and those can significantly help to reduce those irritated inflamed papules that occur and many times that is what causes the most anxiety in cases of patients who have rosacea third for the broken capillaries on the face thank God for lasers because they really help to reduce and get rid of those little teeny-weeny capillaries that are creating the red and pink hue to the cheeks and lastly ocular rosacea which actually can be the trickiest one to treat and can come on and off for years your dermatologist may give you an oral antibiotic to subside some of the inflammation or even recommend gentle cleansers to place along the eyelid to get rid of some aback grit so I hope from this episode that you learned that there are different components to rosacea but also a lot of different treatment options so definitely get in to your dermatologist and definitely check out some of the products we recommended today thank you so much for watching this episode of dear derm don't forget to subscribe to well and good and leave any comments below you",

        "transcript": "hey guys it's fear and today i'm going to talk to you about rosacea and my ipl experience i want to disclose first and foremost i was not paid to make this video i am not going to even name the place that i want to have my treatment done even though i would recommend them because i had a positive experience i just want to share my experience with you with my rosacea and ipl because so many of you have asked for this video just background on me i don't have a medical degree my degree is in anthropology i have a bachelor's in anthropology and i have a minor in english so really this you know i am not a medical expert so everything i'm telling you is my own personal experience um in 2012 i was diagnosed with rosacea and i started seeing a dermatologist and the dermatologist put me on metro gel and axone to treat my rosacea and really both of those products dried my skin out and made me miserable before i made this video i was back looking at some of my old journal entries from 2012 and after i start my rosacea medication i am so miserable because yes it's helping to control the breakouts but it's drying my skin out and i just feel like crap and so before i jump right in i'm gonna tell you i have absolutely no makeup on my face except for my lips i'm wearing occ color pencil and anime my skin is completely bare so you can see all of the flaws in my skin i only have one light on because i wanted to make sure that there's no way at all that this light is possibly you know over saturating my skin so you can really see what i look like um and not that i normally have on lots of extra lights but i do often turn on a second light for photography so that i can make sure i don't have any shadow anyway what forced me to go and seek ipl as a treatment option is that i felt like my skin was really dry in that it had aged i don't know like 10 years and two years from the rosacea medication and even worse than that after i worked out every time like i would have a flare up and for me a flower flare-up is where my skin would get all red and you know it didn't just look horrible it was very uncomfortable it was a burning sensation and it was like this for hours so it was miserable and i was like i can't keep doing this i can't keep working out and experiencing this horrible flare-up i've got to do something so i researched different places in tampa and i ended up you're going to probably think this is crazy but after researching them finding a couple that had good reviews i went and looked on groupon to see if there were any that had any groupons and i found a couple that had groupons i went back through the reviews on yelp and tried to determine which places which place i should go and then i finally just um i think i actually ended up on living social too to look around but i looked at reviews in all different kinds of places before i decided on a place and i went there and i wasn't sure you know if the treatment was working and the reason i waited so long to make this video is because i've now had five treatments and i'm not gonna go for another treatment for six months but i was just at my dermatologist office because my dermatology office does not offer this treatment at all and they don't recommend places for ipl even though they recommend the treatment so like i said i had to do a lot of my own research to find a place to go but i had them look at my skin and they said that my skin does look better than when i first started seeing them two years ago it has better uh like i guess elasticity and it's obviously less angry it's less sensitive i'm not having the flare-ups that i was having after i worked out and which is really good because i've been going to the gym four times a week this month so if i was having those back to back to back i would be completely miserable i haven't really had a flare-up for like the past six maybe seven weeks the worst i've had is i do have a couple little zits but i'm taking oratia which is an oral antibiotic that is used to treat rosacea and it's basically a very very low dose so i take it every other day unless i'm having like a breakout like i am right now where i take it every day rosacea as you may or may not know is caused by a lot of different potential triggers my triggers were working out um too much time in like the hot tub from too much hot like basically extreme temperatures really bother my skin like extreme hot extreme cold uh stress stress is a trigger alcohol can be a trigger for some people i haven't really noticed it doing more than like making my cheeks a little flush but i think that might be sort of normal that everyone's cheeks kind of flush a little bit i'm kind of babbling um i guess let me move close so you can see my face and i'm going to just look around so you can see my face is actually slightly darker than my neck which is why i like to match my foundation to my neck and my chest so that i'm a uniform color as opposed to really dark and pale so i'm gonna get up here so you can see i bet that's probably you know closer than you ever wanted to look at my face um i do still have some like even after five ipl treatments i do still have some discoloration along the sides of my nose that are red that really need to be hit again with the laser i have a spot here on my cheek and this used to have like a sort of weird raised texture to it but after having five treatments it's more smoothed out and a lot of like the i guess you would call them sun damage spots that are like around my eyes over here they've sort of gotten lighter in color from not only doing the five ipl treatments but also using vitamin c products religiously you have to keep using vitamin c products like for months and months months and months and months religiously if you ever expect to get any results from them so even without makeup right now i don't feel like i'm so hideous that if i walk down the street people be like what's wrong with you and what used to happen to me with my rosacea if i didn't wear makeup is people would say is something wrong you know your face is all red and blotchy um and then if i was having like a full-on flare-up people be like did you get sunburned when were you out in the sun i mean why is the rest of you not burnt and just you know uncomfortable questions that i really don't want to answer for me personally i wish that as soon as i was diagnosed with rosacea my doctor had told me that ipl existed and i could get it to treat my rosacea because honestly i hate the medications all of them i i just i am not a fan because at least personally for me like the metro gel dried me out the axon which is supposed to be for treating acne dried me out really horribly too so the only medication that i'm a fan of which isn't really a medication so much as it is a band-aid is my vaso and my vaso does not treat rosacea it does not prevent the breakouts or flare-ups or anything like that but what it does is hide it so instead of having like the redness across your face if you put it on you put on a very thin layer of it it will like make all of the redness go away and so that's really great but the problem is it's sporadic if you don't put on a thick enough coat it may not last more than four hours and if you put on too thick of a coat you know it still may not last the right amount of time and if you miss a spot it's very very obvious but it's one of those medications that sometimes work for me for six hours sometimes it'll work for eight hours sometimes i work on work only for four hours and it was very you know and ultimately it didn't treat like the breakouts that i have or the flare-ups for me i 100 feel like getting the ipl treatments was the best way for me to treat my rosacea from my understanding basically the ipl laser which they put on your face actually let me go through since i wanted to be able to film one of my my treatments but the doctor's office would not allow me to do it so let me explain to you what happens when you go in for a rosacea treatment they cleanse your face they put this conductive gel on your face they put little like um either goggles like little metal goggles or like protective stickers that are the same thing over your eyes and then they go over every inch of your face systematically like they do a pulse so it's like pulse pulse pulse pulls pulls like all over your face for me you would take 20 to 30 minutes um people describe this as being snapped with a rubber band let me tell you it is not fun to get snapped with a rubber band in the face repeatedly over and over again for 20 to 30 minutes however i actually feel like it's almost like being electrocuted it's not really a fun feeling still something i could sit through for the results because the results at least for me have been absolutely 100 worth it basically the ipl what it does is i guess it kills off the blood vessels under the skin that are like right at the surface that cause all the flushing and like the pain and that's awesome obviously results are going to vary some people only need three sessions i had five sessions and like i said i'm going back in six months for a touch-up because it's one of those things that you still have to keep up with like every six months to a year to touch up my friend corey she had it done and she had it done like two or three years ago and she hasn't had to have a touch-up since but it's all in how your skin reacts so really from my perspective if you're considering it talk to your dermatologist first to see if they think that you're a good candidate for it and go from there for me like i said i wish my doctor had told me about it sooner i wouldn't have even with all the medications i just would have gotten the treatment and been done with it you know cost can be an issue like i said check living livingsocial check groupon and then check reviews on whatever doctors fall under those two to see if maybe you can find a deal for yourself or also you can always call a doctor's office and offer to pay in cash rather than through your insurance because if you pay in cash they're likely to give you a discount so anyway yeah my feelings on rosacea rosacea sucks um for me the best way to treat rosacea is to do ipl the intense pulsed light that basically kills off all of the horrible blood vessels that cause all the pain and the flare-ups whatever so that i can't have those flare-ups i still get zits which is another side effect of rosacea and i'm controlling the zits with oracia i'm really happy that i'm basically down to taking two like two medicate one medication for my skin um one medication for my anxiety and my allergy medication and this is what i have to tell you about ipl and rosacea in my skin we know what else you want to know about rosacea ipl please let me know if you have any questions and if i can answer them i absolutely will make sure that you go ahead and subscribe to my channel i make new videos on tuesdays and fridays and sometimes in between thanks so much for watching",

        "transcript": "hi guys April is rosacea awareness month and if you have the skin condition you are in good company because Millions suffer from rosacea myself included I'll let you in on a little secret I did not film any videos last week because I was actually getting my treatment for rosacea which is something I do a few times a year it's a laser treatment called pulse Dye Laser also known as PDL and it can help with that flushing and redness that you get with rosacea I particularly get it on my nose and on my cheeks so it's not a particularly painful procedure but it's not comfortable either it's kind of like somebody sitting there snapping a rubber band in your face um for about you know three to five minutes here's a photo of me right after walking back to my car here's a pic at day one whoa swelling here's day two and here's day three here I am a week later most of the swelling has gone down there's some really slight erythema that mostly can be covered with makeup now usually it takes several weeks to actually notice a difference it takes a little bit for this to work oftentimes multiple treatments are necessary spaced at least a month apart and the results are not permanent so oftentimes you'll still need to get regular treatments every year in order to maintain the results so these type of lasers and other light treatments like IPL work relatively well for this particular type of rosacea called erythamato telangic tatic rosacea and that generally means you just have flushing maybe some enlarged blood vessels primarily nose cheeks maybe chin upper lip sometimes forehead in this video I'm going to discuss the different types of rosacea and different treatment options if you're just tuning in I'm Dr Abby Waldman I'm a dermatologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston so the exact cause of rosacea is unknown but is thought to be some component of environmental factors plus genetic factors there are several triggers that are known to cause flare-ups of rosacea those can include sunlight spicy food lots of caffeine intake stress exercise hot cold weather I know for me exercise and cold and hot weather are definitely triggers for my rosacea there are some recent studies that show a correlation between gastrointestinal diseases and rosacea so those who have common GI problems like Crohn's disease celiac disease ulcerative colitis IBS small intestinal bacterial overgrowth suggesting that there's some link between skin health and gut health but I definitely think more research is needed in this Arena identifying and avoiding the triggers can help reduce flares of your rosacea so I mentioned that I suffer from erythematodectatic rosacea which is just a tendency to flush and have enlarged blood vessels another type of rosacea is popular pustular type which tends to have pimples and pustules on the the nose and cheeks primarily and it can even mimic acne vulgaris the typical acne that you think of you could have a type of rosacea called ocular rosacea which involves drying of the eyes redness itching and even forming lots of little styes little bumps on the lower eyelid 5 minutes rosacea is a form where there's a body part that actually gets big and swollen especially as you get older and older the primary form is rhinophyma where your nose becomes enlarged and the tissue kind of becomes spongy granulomatous rosacea is a really severe form of rosacea there's no cure for rosacea but there are lots of medications available that can help with symptoms in addition to the laser and light treatments I mentioned for the flushing there are several topical medications that can help with flushing including brimonidine and oxymetozoline those are temporary measures they reduce redness by vasoconstricting the blood vessels and so they're a good way like before going to an event to reduce redness but they're not going to be a long-term solution other topical medications that can be prescribed or metronidazole azelaic acid and Ivermectin oral antibiotics can be prescribed to reduce inflammation oftentimes these are prescribed at low doses for really long periods of time in addition to medication you want to be super diligent about Sun Sun is a common trigger and really makes this worse if you're sensitive to sunscreen which sometimes can be the case if you have rosacea then you want to find something really gentle oftentimes you will tolerate a mineral based sunscreen more than chemical based sunscreens but really just finding one that works for you and being able to use it consistently is going to help quite a bit and then when you're really out in the sun you want to wear big broad rimmed hat you want to stay out of the direct sunlight with a cover and you want to wear protective clothing you want to avoid using harsh irritating ingredients in your skin care that being said I do know that oftentimes people really can tolerate a retinoid or a retinol but you just might have to go Go real real slow to introduce that and you want to wait until after any flare is gone and then start it once your skin is all clear and then really really slowly introduce a retinoid it actually has been shown that it could help um minimize the flares of the rosacea but if you use it while you're having a flare oftentimes it can just be a little bit too much a little bit too irritating going through it myself I know that it can be really frustrating managing rosacea there are several treatment options available and you want to seek advice from your dermatologist if

        "transcript": "this is me before when i had rosacea this is me now when i don't have resistance you're now gonna tell me that rosacea is not curable this is total bs because i did it i am the powerful person that i can cure anything anything and yes i did the same thing with rosacea i had rosacea for a year and i was doing a lot of research guys when you get something going on with your health you know something is wrong and i know that there is an answer to get rid of that crap that i had in my life now i am not a doctor telling you straight away i am aesthetician i have my skincare brand and i was like what the heck is going on with my skin so i took my power it took my time i took my brain and researched and i have done a lot of research now this is what worked for me it does not mean that the same thing is going to work for you i highly highly recommend to do your own research rosacea is a chronic skin issue that is not true even though every single doctor in the world gonna tell you that this is true this is absolutely not true rosacea is not a skin issue rosacea is inflammation in your gut issue and it might be in the entire body inflammation so what happened when i started having rosacea and it came gradually not like right away one day i woke up and my skin is red it came like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly but with that i had other issues as well in my body and i'm very very good to listen to my body because i only had in the past diabetes hashimoto's surgeon i have obviously got all this crap going on with my health i overcame that everything is in remission i'm super happy or super healthy and i realized that rosacea is one of those outwomen disorders when i went to my tyra doctor i go to endocrinologist once a year because i have a history of hashimoto's i have to go keep checking my thyroid levels all the time and the rust last time when i talked to her she's like do you know rosacea is actually autoimmune disorder which nobody is actually talking about but i'm happy that my um doctor endocrinologist she's a little bit more towards on the holistic side so i started digging in um you know in all the articles research done about rosacea and there's a lot of confusing information a lot of contradictory contradiction you know against one another and this is like i was like lost and you know what when you're lost when there is information this is bad this is good this is good basically you can find the same information one article where you're gonna say this actually works and another article gonna say this is not working so what happens when you have this going on one saying one another saying another thing you actually test it and try on your body and this is what actually worked for me by the way all the medical articles everything i'm gonna put down below do your own research i highly highly recommend do your own research before you start doing what i did and so long story short rosacea is basically inflammatory disease condition that you can actually heal it or at least you can put it in remission you can become friends with that and don't be afraid it's actually curable i have situations where i cried and i thought what the heck is going on with my skin i cried i didn't want to film youtube videos i am youtuber i am influencer i am aesthetician and i own skincare brand can you believe can you imagine how much pressure i have on my shoulders i almost got depressed because i had rotation where i am representation of my brand i'm always presenting my skincare brand with my skin right i am obsessed about micro needlings their broilers and everything and i was like one day i can't do anything because main point of me is promoting my products right with having a nice skin and then i realized you know that rosacea is not the skin issue rosacea is the issue over there probiotics probiotics are good bacteria for your gut i use at this moment two different probiotics i always rotate i never use the same one i highly highly recommend to rotate any kind of supplements um probiotics or detox supplements that you taking taking at all times um again i'm telling you i am not a doctor this is what works for me don't take my recommendations seriously without doing your own research sakura might well already works very very well with candida i double this dose even you're supposed to take one pill i double i did two because when something happens rosacea is basically either some sort of pathogenic issue either you have parasites bacteria virus any kind of mold uh mercury whatever any kind of pathogens we don't know what we don't know right um studies also been uh showing that uh people with rosacea don't remember percentage but it's quite high above 70 percent people with rosacea have h pylori in gut that's mean that we have h pylori bacteria um and which is not good bacteria it can destroy our gut system and that affects our skin basically our skin is a mirror what's happening in the gut there is a correlation there is always relation your gut and the skin uh second some probiotics that i was taking this is ladybugs this is from walgreens just simply a lot of good lactobacillus different kind of bacteria i also double the dose of this so basically i was taking three to four pills of probiotics nothing is going to happen you're not going to overdose probiotics if you're taking double the dose uh this is what you want when you have a bacteria and of course this is not going to heal this is not going to cure but this has a huge impact another supplement that right now is bad on amazon and hopefully they're not going to ban my video this is not and acetylchycene nike is basically building antioxidants in your body short short version what is snack you can do your own research with a snack another product that helped me a lot i was listening to one really really great um a scientist that done a lot of research about rosacea he's like phd dermatologist he's some sort of like i had i don't remember the name i just listened to him and he mentioned this product nicotinamide riboside chloride or um this is from true niagara basically now which is strengthens our immunity basically they have fuel oxidation in the body we all have oxidative stress right we all have sort of like oxidation in the body with the age when we're aging we are not getting younger our cells is not getting younger we're getting only older and our cells age like when you look in the mirror you only see wrinkles right you you have a pain getting older 50 60 70 80 years old whatever even some people start getting sick much earlier like i started be sick at the age of 30. so i have a little bit of knowledge just to see guys i'm all about research i'm doing about research and reading book this is my favorite the health bible book the hands down this is what heal me what the hell means for those who are interested gotten psychology syndrome how god actually affects our psychological issues and any kind of issues in life oh my god guys i will go for hours and hours talking about the health how important is to actually start with him start with what you eat and stuff like this um so this one it is i think that helped me really really really a lot i started seeing differences right away and everything what i'm talking about more or less can apply not only rosacea sensitive skin acne skin any kind of other chronic skin issues and now let's go to um it's not a supplement it's actually um something that i did for myself it is colonics that helped me really really a lot and i'm not gonna go into diets you know guys i'm super super healthy i'm not eating any crap sugars dairy and gluten and stuff like this i am talking about right now about supplementations because i think that had a huge the biggest impact in my uh journey healing rosacea so colonics is a colon hydrotherapy where actually i cannot insert small footage when i did um it's basically cleaning your bowels doing like sort of like hey you can do enema at home but that's like professionally done by a colon hydrotherapist a procedure that you cleanse your bowels they put a little thing in your butthole and like basically filling up with the water and that water when it comes out it comes out all the bacteria basically this is a very natural way to detox your body i just did colonies at this amazing place thank you ladies the best the best massage and thank you for coming we appreciate you so much thank you some of you actually one person today or yesterday texted me hey jin i love your pager on instagram and stuff like this but i would like you not to post anything related with colonics i'm sorry but i'm standing for this i know it works it worked for me and if you don't like it if you never tried and you don't have any like serious health issues you can judge me as much as i want i'm standing for what worked for me and i know what for other people because i follow other people that heal themselves from chronic really chronic bad uh health issues and i'm doing myself the same thing and is helping me and if it's helping me i'm gonna stand for this stuff and i will promote this as soon as this is legal i have a right to speak up and i have a right to help people and i know some of you already thanking me and saying i i love when i receive messages hey jin thank you so much for this book remain recommendation i have at least 20 or 30 people that they say thank you jen for recommending this book they are healing i love when people can heal i love when people can feel better i just have this insane passion in my heart to help people because i know how bad feels when you're freaking sick when you're sick you don't want to do anything and when you heal you're just like you get your power back you can live it you can enjoy life i will always stand for what i believe and i believe in animal a lot something that i have not talked much and something that i was i'm gonna be honest i was kind of you know against it it's one sort of type of antibiotics that helped me with rotation i knew i had the research done the metro dinosaur i knew topically works with rosacea and i was always against any kind of antibiotic steroids something not natural to the human body but here is the thing um when you are actually loaded with a lot of oxidative stuff in your body when you have a lot of pathogens bacteria viruses and stuff like this and nothing really helps or maybe i didn't do enough then i was like you know what i'm gonna try antibiotics and funny story quick quick story actually i basically took those antibiotics not for rosacea reason i knew that metronidazole actually gel topical gel works for rosacea but i knew rosacea is actually internal so what happened actually one day i woke up and i had uh bacterial vaginosis bv and it was so bad that any kind of natural remedies didn't work for me so i went to my guy you know he's like you need metronidazole and stuff like this and you know i started taking this because when you have bacterial vaginosis you know the smell is not really pleasant and like i'm gonna do whatever it takes because i have to change my underwear five times a day and i cannot go in the public place because the smell is that bad and you know it's kind of weird sharing with you this but this is true this is what we women face every day you know in our lives and that's okay i'm no different than you right so this is what happened i started taking those antibiotics i did the research and the more i did research before i put something on my skin or on my body in my mouth i actually do research the more research i did the more i realized that metronidazole zoell at beauty is actually helping with rashes internally so it is funny story how i'm sharing actually how i got antibiotics for rosacea to cumulation heal rosacea but it wasn't kind of intentionally so sometimes you know things happen in life because it's supposed to happen and i think for example i believe that i don't know god or universe wherever you believe that sending me sometimes struggles so i can actually share with you i can overcome this the same was with hashimoto's and diabetes i can actually overcome this and i actually can share that information to you and can help some of you even if it's going to be just one person that i'm going to be helping that's a lot imagine if one person in the world and how many eight billion people if just one person helped to somebody else every day we all will make this planet a better place to live right so i hope this video helps let me know down in the comments below what helped you if you have any chronic health issue especially skin issues let me know because i'm learning so much i'm learning every day i'm learning from you and i'm so grateful to have you over here on my channel thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't

        "transcript": "[Music] hi everyone my name is katarina marie and today i'm going to be talking about my ipl photo facial review so my skin's always been pretty red um it can be caused from like being too hot too cold running up the stairs too fast basically anything my face just gets really red especially like around my cheek area so it's quarantine time it's time for self improvement and i'm just over it i want to have like clear skin without waking up and having to put foundation on it so it looks like a normal color um i can kind of like tell because if i like compare my neck skin to my face skin my neck skin looks totally normal same with like my arm if i put it next to it i can kind of see my cheeks are just like unnaturally red so i did some research in real self ipl has pretty good reviews so i found a local place it's willing to let me film my experience and i'm pretty excited i hope my skin ends up being like at least a relatively normal color after this i'm not expecting it to be like perfectly the same as the rest of my body but at least if it could be a little less red because the ipl laser is supposed to work by targeting the tiny little veins in your skin and just causing them to like die essentially with my understanding of it so basically the laser is just gonna shrink all those little veins and once the little veins are gone should be also less redness especially because my skin's really thin so i feel like any little vein any little anything underneath my skin it just shows through immediately so if i can just get rid of them entirely hopefully my skin will be clear and a normal color okay i'm gonna try and get really close so you can actually see how red it is so if i hold up my arm with like normal color skin to my face you can see in comparison it's actually really red um the same within comparison to my neck pretty much it's just pretty much all over like all back here so i don't have anything on right now other than a little bit of eyebrow filler mascara and moisturizer on my face but i don't have anything on my actual facial skin so you can see it's like really red and yeah i'm just over it i want to just go to wake up put on mascara do my brows and then call it a day i don't want to have to like always have on at the minimum a layer of sheer foundation or something to feel comfortable going out so that's the dream fingers crossed ipl works hey oh [Applause] hi everyone i'm back again i did my first ibl treatment and i actually really like it um it's been about three weeks since i did it so i feel like my skin's had enough time to heal and like close off the veins and i can actually see a difference which i'm pretty surprised because i know you're supposed to do like multiple treatments i think a minimum of three ipl treatments to actually see a really significant difference but even after one i can already see it and like again like comparing my face to my neck obviously it's still a bit more red like it's not perfect but it's a lot better and i by no means had like severe rosacea but definitely still enough to kind of like have a noticeable difference in my everyday life so i'm really happy i did it in the end it wasn't too painful it actually hurt less than i thought because i was like really nervous going into it and she was like no don't worry it's not gonna hurt you don't even need numbing creams i'm like okay so yeah after the first like little zap i was like oh this is like nothing to be scared of um when i checked the reviews some people said it was like super painful they had numbing cream and it still hurts i'm not really sure why it wasn't that bad for me but maybe it's just like a different strength setting or something like that that's my guess but yeah so i especially on this side of my face had like a lot of those teeny little veins just from like squeezing my blackheads too hard or like genetics i'm not sure why they are there but ipl is also supposed to be good for getting rid of that um i think they're called spider veins so i had like a teeny bit of those around my nose and like one in my cheek somewhere and actually those are reduced too which i was surprised it's like not even the reason i went in but they're like definitely reduced and i know some people they go to get ipl like only for the purpose of getting rid of spider veins so that's like another cool thing that you can go for um pretty much i'm really happy with it i'm going to get closer so you can see it better but you can already tell like the difference between my neck or my arm to my face it's so much less red so i'm so happy and yeah so it's it's been gradually getting less and less red since i first did it three weeks ago and maybe it'll continue to get even better i'm not sure my skin's like still healing or not but yeah i can see such a big difference and i'll probably end up doing like a second treatment maybe another two months from now or so so yeah another thing i wanted to say is along with like not really having much pain during it i also didn't have a lot of things that like some people report after like some people say that where they have like freckles or like hyperpigmentation turned really really dark after ipl and then like disappeared i never had any of that i think they call it coffee grounds like because it looks like coffee grounds are on your skin i never experienced that but i also don't really have freckles anymore um and i don't really have any hyperpigmentation because i think my skin's just not really prone to it it's more prone to redness instead of like darkness so that never happened to me um but it's probably for the best because um basically like immediately after my face was definitely pretty red but i didn't even have peeling like i didn't really have any issues um i basically kind of just looked like normal like maybe even just three hours afterwards so yeah it was um easy breezy i definitely i recommend it um i'm gonna probably do it another time to give my like full review but at least this is part one and you can see that i'm very happy with it so far so yes ipl definitely recommended [Music] you",

I'd cover it up with make-up and I didn't really think about it and it was only then that it started getting progressively worse, it went \n to my cheeks and then my chin and above my eyebrows. It was really stingy and I'd wake up in \n the morning with little white pimply spots. So once it started doing that, I thought right, I've got to \n get this seen to so I went to the doctors. At first they said oh no you know, try this cream, it's fine. But by the time I went back the third time and I said look i'm \n getting these little pimply spots and he said oh, ok well perhaps it's Rosacea? The doctor gave me a few different products to \n try, different medicines, which none really worked. I just felt at the end of my \n tether, I did't know where to turn I didn't go out with my friends as much as I used \n to so it was really a push if I went out. And If I felt that my face was a little \n bit bad that day then I wouldn't go. My sister in law was in quite a famous chemist,  she came across Derrmalex, was reading the back of \n the box and saw that it treated Rosacea and the phoned me and said check this out, \n you know, look it up, so I did. I found their website, I started using the product, I put \n it on morning and night time and it was fantastic. I was waking up in the morning, I still had the little pimples \n but they weren't hurting, my face wasn't sore, it wasn't as red and I actually get up in the morning now and I look straight \n in the mirror and think ok, it's not too bad today. Just one layer of makeup is fine! My confidence has just gone through the roof. I feel that my skin is great now, it's so so \n so much better and that's all thanks to Dermalex.",
