        "description": "Roseacea is a redness of the skin sometimes accompanied by acne, oiliness and enlargement of the pores and the nose.",
        "published_at": "2023-02-24T10:00:57Z",
        "transcript": "hello I'm Dr Marianne titlebum and today we're going to talk about rosacea rosacea is defined as a skin rash whose cause is unknown it's said that the small vessels in the face dilate creating reddening irritation sometimes acne grease on the face sometimes the skin pores get enlarged and even enlargening of the nose can occur it's recommended that you should avoid anything hot to prevent more heating of the skin like hot spices alcohol sunlight stress fragrances and heat in general now while these recommendations are correct what really needs to be done is to dig deeper into the underlying causes and with every patient I see I tell them that it's like putting pieces of a puzzle together in order to First identify all the underlying causes and once we find these underlying causes which are different in each person then we can begin building a treatment plan which includes specific targeted herbs dietary changes and detoxification procedures it's always difficult to describe how we treat any health problem because the real truth is that there is no protocol to treat anything so with any disease such as rosacea and any others you can think of there is no protocol for treatment because the underlying causes are different in each person and each person is unique in what herbs they can and cannot handle the diet for each person is different and each person will walk away with a totally different detox protocol than the next patient so as hard as it is to do I'll attempt to give a general rundown of the way we treat it now I always tell the patients that we have to start at The Superficial level and keep working our way backwards until we eventually reach all of the deep underlying causes and by now if you've been listening to any of my videos or the classes on my website you know that anything on the skin is showing you the health of the body on the inside the skin is the largest organ in the body doing just what it was designed to do all day every day and that is to dump toxins out onto the skin but you don't usually see or feel the toxins as they come through but when you start to see redness itching acne and other issues on the skin this lets you know that the toxins coming through are very hot and burning and they hurt the skin as they come through so now let's begin asking pertinent questions and working our way backwards so why would the toxins be hot well because the blood which is holding these toxins is hot and why would the blood be hot because the liver which makes the blood from the food you eat is hot from all the toxins that are being held in it we call these hot toxins coming through the skin amavisha and garavisha omnivisia forms in the gut if either something is wrong with your digestion and or the food is too heavy and it tends to remain stuck in the bowel instead of absorbing into the bloodstream once this residue known as Amma of partially digested food gets stuck it rots and ferments and forms the amavisia the word Bishop means poison so now this channel clogging and very cold armor has become very hot inflammatory and acidic and then when this type of toxin comes through the skin it forms all kinds of skin conditions like rosacea so the first step in treating rosacea is to identify and treat all the weaknesses in digestion which includes the gut microbiome the liver and the gallbladder to help prevent the formation of the omnivision in the first place and of course we have to look at the diet the second type of hot toxin is known as garvisha now these toxins are made outside the body like Pharmaceuticals skin care products air pollution pesticides perfumes fragrances and the toxins found in processed foods so in these cases we have to see all the mistakes that person's making with these types of chemicals and try to reduce them to as few as possible then cleansing has to be done to take them out of the body the skin is also showing you the health of the liver any toxin you take into the body whether orally through the skin or breathing it in Finds Its way ultimately into the liver most modern toxins nowadays are very hot in nature which is why we have global warming as the whole earth is heating up from the air pollution and Industry but on a smaller scale our liver is heating up from the non-stop chemical toxins going through it on a daily basis then again if the liver gets hot the liver makes the blood then the blood gets hot which heats up the toxin sitting in the blood as I just mentioned so with most cases of rosacea we have to be careful how we give the herbs and we have to give them an away that won't heat the liver which means that we will have to give many of the herbs either transdermally through the skin or through herbal nectar drops which are put in water which retain the intelligence of the herb without having to give the crude Herb in a tablet or tea form which will flare up the heat in the liver and the blood and thus flare up the rosacea so this is an important point we also have to take our patients off most of the nutraceuticals they take as these highly processed and synthetic versions of the vitamins also create quite a bit of heat and toxicity in the liver and many times we even have to take the patient off herbs even the ayurvedic ones that they're taking as they unwittingly are swallowing lots of herbal tablets tinctures and teas in their efforts to get well but they're actually heating the liver even more stoking the Flames for the skin condition we all know by now that we've surrounded ourselves with about 80 000 chemicals in the food air water on the skin and in the Pharmaceuticals most chemicals get stored in our body in our fat cells the sweat is the detox pathway of the fat cells therefore we have to use a wide variety of herbs to detox both the fat cells and the sweat and to make matters even more complicated whenever you look at any skin problem you're looking at toxins that were stuck in your bone marrow so this also means that we have to clean the bone marrow but you have to be very Artful in your approach to doing this because the skin can flare up even more when you begin pulling toxins out of the bone marrow and this is because when you pull toxins from any of the deep tissues like the bone marrow they will come out through channels into the bowel movement urine and the sweat now you might not see them in the bowel movement in urine but you can definitely see them coming through the skin especially when they're so hot and reactive which means that your wonderful detox of the bone marrow will now flare up your skin condition so you have to do very slow detox over the Long Haul rather than attempting to pull the toxins out very quickly which everyone wants to do and during the cleanses you have to lubricate the physical channels as they come through so they don't rupture the channels on their way out and you have to do all this cleaning of the liver The Blood The Sweat the fat cells and the bone marrow while at the same time keeping the liver cool fortunately my teacher and Mentor Dr r.k Mishra who I interned with for 20 years taught me all the details of how to do this correctly it took me many years to learn but his five thousand year old family lineage of ayurveda known as Chaka vancia ayurveda or SVA were all dermatologists so thanks to vaija Mishra I was able to learn the correct way to treat these very difficult skin conditions taking all the precautions every step of the way and guiding each patient very carefully down their own unique Narrow Path as they recover he made various skin creams skin Clays probiotic creams for the skin clays for the liver and many types of Avianca oils for daily oil massages and each patient gets their own unique tea recipe using remedies to direct the toxins away from the skin and into the urine remedies to calm down the reactivity of the toxins as they come through the skin remedies to clean the fat cells purify the sweat and cool the heat in the liver now there are many other avenues we could take depending on what's needed in each patient but in this video I hope to give you a general idea of the correct way to treat rosacea rather than just giving antibiotics which will make this problem worse in the long run as the antibiotics will destroy more of the gut microbiome and heat the liver even more I hope you can see the very deep way we address not only rosacea but all skin conditions this is a truly inspired way of tackling the problems from the source as opposed to giving each patient the same treatment designed only to keep the skin cool and free of infection thank you",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": "[Music] hi everybody it's Brad with the big family Homestead and in this video I am super excited to be showing you how I deal with my rosacea I just got a colloidal silver where the heck did I go a colloidal silver making machine and I've been using colloidal silver on my rosacea and it's been working now before we go any further I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on TV this is not medical advice this is just what happens for me so you figure out what you need to do with your doctor but it's working for me so here we [Music] go that's right I am in no way a medical doctor this is not medical advice I'm just telling you what has happened in my own experience and that is this uh if you've known the channel for any long amount of time you've known that my face gets really really nasty bright red and gross pimply and I went to the doctor finally and he said guess what brother you have rosacea so he sent me home with his two of goo and for about 2 weeks it worked really well and then the third week it started not to work and I thought to myself boy am I in for a long hard Haul on this well a friend suggested hey I know the benefits of colloidal silver for this this this and this and it seems to be the kind of thing that would treat that kind of an ailment why not try it so I I basically stopped using the medicine that the doctor gave me and I I started just basically taking a face wash just a small amount of face wash wash my face once or twice a day with the uh the colloidal silver and it pretty much is Gone Gone Gone Gone zero no issue as long as I remember to do it now I'm going to zoom in here and you're going to see I still got a little bit of ready red around and the reason I went ahead and left that and did this video now is because watch my videos 2 or 3 days from now and you'll see it won't be there I just I'm making a new batch of colloidal silver and so you'll see check it out the difference will be there that stuff will be gone and if you've known the channel from before it's it gets really bad in the past so unboxed all the stuff from the colloidal silver machine folks and well show you what's in it let's show you how we're going to make it and then I might even wash my face so here we go tons and tons of information manuals stuff on Cole silver advertisements of course business cards just in case you lost any one of these gazillion things and of course your silver bars and scrubby oh that's nice scrubby okay you also get in the Box this handy dandy timer they give you instructions on how to use the timer but it's pretty basic stuff a couple extra pins but you only use really one set of pins so there you have it and you actually have the generator generating machine uh plugs into the wall here I'm assuming you've got your inputs outputs however you want to Define it for your silver rods and the bubbler for the bubbly bubbliness so pretty basic stuff you also need a quart size container and some distilled water steam distilled water not purified water not mineral water steam distilled water now one quick word on some of the different products out there that they will uh generate the colloidal silver using salt uh this particular machine you do not need to do that as a matter of fact if you do it's going to keep your particle size of of generated silver larger you want them smaller smaller so no salt in this machine now one other quick tip is colloidal silver is extremely extremely adversely affected by light so anytime you can get either a Darkly colored bottle or something to keep the light away from your colloidal silver that is going to be all the better so keep it out of the light all right first things first let's fill up our quart jar with our distilled water says give about an inch of head space that looks just about right there that's a careful step there there now it's all happy in darkness next let's get our silver bars out cleaned up with our scrubby the scrubby scrubby here make sure there's no funkiness on the bars now we're just going to take these silver bars and insert them into the correct points here right there and right there and they should be ready to go now the machine goes on to our water like this [Music] down centered up okay now we're going to go ahead and plug in our timer and our generator and get this timer set so that it's working and bang Zoom we are off to the races and now it's just simply a waiting game you wait your 3 hours it it clocked in at 8: and it's out at 11:00 and you'll have your colloidal silver now this is is an amazing savings too because if you consider it's going to be like 14 bucks for a tiny little bottle like that at a health food store and this thing's making a quart for pennies literally pennies so I would recommend that if you're uh uh interested in self-reliance if you're the you know the kind of uh Homestead or prepper type that you look into some of these natural remedies you never know if you're going to not be able to go get a pill from a store and even if you could do you really want to go get a pill from a store for everything cuz I certainly know I do not not once again not a doctor do your own research colloidal Silver's absolutely been working for my rosacea uh and like I said check back in a few days and you'll see the change I I uh I stopped using it for about 3 days so that I could show you what the difference is going to be check back in about 3 or 4 days and you'll see or you'll say Brad you're full of hogwash and then you can take your shots anyway that's it for the day uh Brad with the big family Homestead you guys have an amazing day [Music]",

        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry a family physician and in this short video let's talk about the rosacea diet and how to reverse the redness associated with rosacea the redness the scaling the blood vessels are embarrassing over 400 million people on the planet suffer from rosacea and I have a secret to tell you later in this video that you might not believe what if I told you that the cause of your rosacea is not some of the triggers you've been told about but it's actually your diet it's what you've been eating and it's what you've not been eating that's what's causing your rosacea that's what this video is all about now if you know someone suffering from rosacea please take a second and share this video with them so that they will know there is hope and there is a solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at the end of this video watch that playlist and learn how to do Kido right Kido is cheap Kido is easy Kido is very safe very natural it's very nutritious and it's very delicious and it's going to help your rosacea get better than you ever dreamed it would be and then you can save your money that you've been wasting on co-pays with the pills and the gels and the creams and the lotions because you won't need those anymore now everyone who's already reversed their rosacea with a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet I need you to do me a favor in the comments below I need you to tell your story because there'll be people watching this video who will absolutely think I'm kooky and won't believe what I'm saying if you're a newbie to this if you're like there's no way you can reverse my rosacea

        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "hello my amber babies we are live and actually in my messy kitchen today i want to share very very important information actually about rosacea you probably know you're familiar that i had rosacea and i have a picture here with me i don't have makeup actually right now and take a look so as you see on the thumbnail this is me before and this is me after rosacea it's curable maybe many doctors gonna tell you that it is not curable it is actually curable on trying to find the right angle for you hi everyone who is joining me live over here talking about rosacea and hi everyone who is watching after a replay i want to share personally what helped me with rosacea because i'm getting a lot of a lot of questions hey jen what did you do your skin is looking so much better the way it was before and last night i was deleting my older pictures and i was like oh my oh my god it's like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] i had really really terrible skin so my skin is still not completely perfect not 100 perfect but right now for example i don't have makeup and i actually slept last night only five hours i want safari so anyway i want to share what i did what helped me with my journey with my rosacea with my skin issue rosacea makes you feel really really really freaking insecure when i had rosacea i was like oh my god i lost confidence i i felt like i lost my identity i felt like awareness and consciousness and anything like who i was and i didn't want to film youtube videos i didn't want to go in the street without makeup i felt really bad my skin was dry flaky red irritated inflamed and that affected me like emotionally spiritually physically i didn't i didn't want to do anything i didn't want to exercise i didn't want to like work i was in the mood i think i was at the point where i was depressed and i was like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] why this is happening people think skin is just a skin skin is your representation right when you see people when you meet person to person like face to face where you watch you look at the face right so rosacea made me feel really really insecure guys i remember i stopped filming youtube videos i i didn't i i wasn't consistent on youtube for like more than a year when i had rosacea and i want to share with you actually wrote down i took my time right now i wrote down a lot of steps what i personally did i did a research and actually what really helped me personally so this video is going to be long but really really information on what helped me and i recommend it to many of my followers many clients those tips and actually is working and am i gonna get where i'm gonna put all the information together in some like free i don't know book or something like that like um pdf file where you can download and we can actually follow these steps what i did i don't know you i don't know what is the cost uh there are many causes of authorization what was in my situation i actually had rosacea that was triggered by the h pylori bacteria and you can google actually yourself you can go and do your um own research but in my studies what i was researching uh most of the time h pylori bacteria overgrowth in your gut actually like triggering and have big big big impact i wouldn't say it's a complete 100 cause but it has a one of the biggest impacts um in developing rosacea and triggering rosacea so um rosacea is really really really topic that was one of the most painful topics that i want to share with all of you and i had the acne actually to get rid of acne which was much much easier rosacea is considered autoimmune disorder if you're going to go to an endocrinologist and they're going to tell you that rosacea it is actually autoimmune disorder so you know autoimmune disorder means you have low immune system and you need to strengthen that so i'm going to share and actually have all the supplements vitamins what i was taking what actually works for me hi everyone who are here right now welcome to my kitchen welcome to my messy uh kitchen i wanted to film actually in the kitchen and because i have all the supplements vitamins and it's a lot it's a lot uh you don't have to do what i did but what worked for me i really want to share with you guys so um love you so much simmer down day spa hey jen hey love beauty is from bangladesh hey tell me guys where are you from over here live i would love to know anyway so let's go to supplements so i have three kind of um options not options like um three niches what helped me supplements lifestyle and skin care so let's start with the supplements very the most probably important is probiotics because if you have h pylori bacteria that's mean that bacteria is a bad bacteria and it's destroying your gut most of the time like 90 percent of the any issues health issues skin issues are related with your gut if you have rosacea you most likely here and there notice that you have a bloating belly aches constipation maybe diarrhea maybe when you eat your tummy aches and you're not in the mood your gut is related to your brain neurotransmitters and actually affects your mood most likely people they have rosacea they're not in the mood they have a bipolar disorder or they have anxiety or they just feel down and it's just like like a like a cycle it's not something cause something is like it's all together so probiotics to me was the biggest like impact and i have um a couple of different um probiotics so one this is kind of pricey but i wanted to share this called uh hmf bifida powder actually with this one i do enemas and also um take internally it's really really great all the lists gonna be down below under this video so you you can check it out i highly highly highly recommend do not use the same probiotics all the time rotate because your gut is gonna get used to and you wanna you wanna use something that is always consistently like new to your gut you can come back once you're done you can come back to this again like in a year but the meanwhile so these are really really really important you can do your research then i have candidates i notice sometimes i have a yeast infections or uti which is also can be related with h pylori bacteria so this is a great candidate that it works actually for both for bad bacteria and for yeast infections if you have if you tend to have everything is related your damaged gut flora can affect absolutely any issue in your healthy heart then i have a premier probiotic caps these are incredible what probiotics do they basically are good bacteria that nourishes your damaged gut flora you have a damaged gut flora because you just simply don't have enough good bacteria to fight so when you send those good bacteria to your gut they are able to fight the bad bacteria and have this balance basically we all have bad and good bacterias but bad bacteria overgrowth diminishes kind of good bacteria and we are like this and the more damage gut flora you have the more um bad bacteria are gonna grow uh less good bacteria gonna have so basically probiotics are a good bacteria that we need you need to start with probiotics immediately tomorrow then neck neck is this guy it is amazing because neck actually replenishes glutathione levels in the body and glutathione is the most powerful the most water thing in our body that actually boosts immune system uh knack stands for an acetyl lc system so i'm using nap all the time i know amazon be discontinued for some reason but some stores they still have a knack get knack right now like for three years for two years in advance until um i kind of have feeling uh eventually these big people gonna discontinue an act because this actually works even for this big word i don't want to say i don't want to say but it starts with the c so knack is really really important to boost our immune system digestive enzymes if you notice that your poop is floating or you have diarrhea or especially if you're constipated and if you eat something and you see food chunks in your poo it is very very important that you need the digestive enzyme absolutely every uh i don't want to say patience because i'm not a doctor by the way this is not medical advice do your own research talk to your own doctor this is what work personally for me i am not a doctor i'm not a nurse i'm not a practitioner this is just what what worked for me what i tested what i did the research you do not have to take this advice at all and by the way if until now you haven't clicked this subscribe button please click subscribe that going to help my channel a lot and i want more people to know what helped with my rosacea so i can help more people all right so digestive enzymes and which one i'm using i have a lot of stuff here so um i also rotate digestive enzymes digestive enzymes that currently i'm using is from optimal looks like that as i mentioned again this all information and links to all the products that i'm mentioning is going to be down below in the description box so all right digestive enzyme then vitamin d and vitamin k strengthens immune system is actually not vitamin it is hormones i it's a hormone i don't know why people name it vitamin but d3 plus k you need that because absolutely every person that has a gut issues has a low stomach acid actually have a low vitamin d if you do the blood test if you have rosacea if you do the blood test i guarantee you will be low in this one so you want to supplement this um vitamin number five natural antibacterial herbal supplements so i do have a couple of to share i also rotate as i mentioned i do not use the same vitamins or supplements all the time i rotate so oregon grape this is number one supplement that you want to have if you have any skin issues so if you have rosacea especially eczema if you have eczema or if you know somebody has eczema this is what you or they need oregon grape helps with many skin conditions nobody's talking about i am talking about you need oregon grape because that helps to replenish gut flora and that affects your skin this is great for rosacea and eczema psoriasis any kind of dermatitis then golden seal you do not want to use um all the time this you can take for 10 days then take 10 days break the same this one use 10 days this 10 days this rotate don't use this all the time it does the same thing both are anti-bacterial antimicrobial herb supplements and then cat's claw this is tincture so i use um this dropper half of the dropper like every third or every fortnight i'm still using it i love it do your own research and then of course we do have january beauty signature um anti-viral antibacterial 12 beautiful herbs over here in this little capsule and um you can check this on my website it's just a few samples that i'm sending to some of you um check it out i do have this on my website okay so this is with antibacterial anti okay the next one is anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory i have those two i have never heard about that my friend who is a naturopathic nutritionist she told me about those two produce and holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] so basically if you have inflammation in your skin you do have inflammation in your gut and these two are anti-inflammatory come from the same company it's called boss med 500 advanced boswellia is a healthy inflammation response and this one is kuramed uh super absorption curcumin curcumin if you know guys it's very very anti-inflammatory this is great if you have any kind of inflammation in your body highly recommend i rotate all of those supplements i know it looks a lot but rotating and investing in your health to prevent actually you can get rid of rosacea this is what happened i'm going to tell you a little bit later by the way stick until the end because at the very very very very end i am going to share two tips that helped me the most what helped me the most that i noticed biggest difference and just stay until then i promise you you'll be like what yeah all right so then it is fish oils you need to have a good quality fish oil first of all if you have a dry skin if you have a sensitive skin if you have a flaky skin eczema rosacea psoriasis you need omegas in your body so fish oil omegas comes from these guys that i'm using and i'm always rotating i am just in love with mercola's products you don't have to like i love it works so much so many comments adhd and anxiety from lithuania currently living okay just i'm reading guys okay love you recommend okay so these are omegas right krill oil and this is herring caviar oil you need omegas in your diet your body is so dry especially if you're using some sort of like a dose antibacterials they most of the time dry out your body you need to notice you need to hydrate another things that i have if you're vegan omegas from flax seeds where is my chia seeds you can get those these are amazing you need to drink this like every day with the shake i just had a shake i put those like this amount of like flax seeds in one shake you need those every day plus they helps with the bowel movement your bowels move faster better for you right and the binders if you for example you using those antibacterial antimicrobial you kill those kind of bacteria microbes you know metals fungi parasites and stuff like this and if you're not pooping consistently if you're not sweating enough which we don't do every day you need to get binders this is my favorite biner gi detox uh bio botanical research incorporation basically it has activated charcoal aloe vera silica apple pectin humic acid it's bind it like basically binds all the bad crap that you have in your body and you sweat it out you shed it out from your body you need binders if you're using all those and you're not using binders don't use binders together with none of those you need to use binders away one and a half hours from anything of those if you're using those in the morning make sure you use those at least two hours after and better if you don't use this with the food so you really really have to be strict i know you're gonna say gin but i'm working nine to five it's kind of hard yes well working nine to five and b being busy and having rosacea is hard right but not having rosacea and taking all those supplements every day is also hard but i choose take those supplements carry it with me all the time no matter where i go if i fly i carry those supplements with me all the freaking time i look like a crazy grandma with a bunch of supplements and vitamins but i take those every day like clearly every day and once a day i have a day when i fast once a month i fast i don't take any of that and i do enema or colonics so think that we're jumping to lifestyle and as you see i see number one enemas so enema and colonics just let's clean this ass why we don't clean our ass i don't know but i was very skeptical before i was introduced into colonics and then i did the colonics one two three sessions and i was like what do you guys do colonics let me know here in the comments in the chat i would like to know if you do colonics and animus hello will be possible to integrate in your video this um i don't know about about subtitles you guys have to figure out i think you can do that going to the settings my grandma had rosation she had these issues with oculars h balar being the major culprit makes sense yeah so animus let me know in the chat if you guys do enemas regularly i do enemas at least at least right now when everything is okay at least once a month when i have a flare-ups when i used to have flare-ups i used to do like once a week enemas are amazing a little bit uncomfortable but they cleanse your ass you cleanse your bowels they cleanse your entire like colon that you can do this naturally when you poop in the restroom and it's funny to talk about that nobody's talking about that but i'm so passionate we need to cleanse the bowels we can't just naturally cleanse the bowel here is a tip that i have if you hate animals you have tried or colonics and you're really really broke you don't have money to do this and you don't have time in the morning one tablespoon of salt with the warm water on the empty stomach right away when you wake up do this three days in a row and on a fourth day you're gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] like crazy i promise to you make sure you don't go to work that day when you do that try on the weekend so um salt eps like not epsom salt is himalayan salt actually from the same i don't have it right now with me but from the same company premier research lab you can find on amazon they have it's called pink himalayan salt it's the best to cleanse your bowel it's gonna work the same when you're gonna drink internally taking your mouth drink it in the morning with the warm water one tablespoon it's gonna be a little bit nasty but it's gonna help you to cleanse everything and you're gonna have light diarrhea so that's gonna help if you don't wanna have enemas see yes i'm talking about [\u00a0__\u00a0] i just took that too okay okay so enemas are very very very very important it cleans your bowels it cleanse the bacteria cleanse h pylori cleanse all the crab that you have in your bowels and you need to cleanse that so uh and then ozone ib i love ozone iv i'm getting ozone iv every single month i'm getting even um i have little let me show you i shouldn't maybe show that but you know what i'm going to show you i have even sometimes when oh my camera is moving this is so cool right so i have a ozone suspiratorys over here when i feel kind of bloated where i feel my digestion is a little bit off i put those in my rectum and it helps me a lot it's funny how people don't understand that our gut it is a mirror and reflection on our face our face is just not the skin our face is a representation of what's happening in your gut where is this book right now i didn't bring this book but book gaps got on psychology syndrome talks about that how god is related to your skin next one from lifestyle acupuncture do acupuncture if you can afford just once a month just do once a month acupuncture it's not expensive and it's so beneficial in chinese medicine everything every organ has their special points on the body and for example when i went when i had rosacea i was doing acupuncture it helped me so much it just regulates balance yin and yang and you know we all have energies we all have this balance acupuncture balances you out this is what was helping to me meditations joe dispenza put in youtube joe dispenza meditation do meditations we need to without addressing nervous system nothing of those white vitamins supplements skin care is not going to work we need to address nervous system meditations help a lot with nervous system you know what helps with nervous system as well we hof breathing go to youtube enter wim hof breathing and do this 11 minute breathing i do this every day almost i've been doing wim hof for like a year right now and helped so much relaxes you you're so in peace you're floating and he did actually study when he was breathing and doing cold showers and he's like he's called iceman he helps with your nervous system to balance your nervous system to strengthen your immune system he was doing crazy experiment they injected the virus in his body and his body like immune system killed all those viruses just because he's not taking like any kind of like vitamins or supplements he's just a normal man but he does cold plunges like cold showers cold baths breathing like he's um he has so many world records for not breathing swimming under the ice like lake and stuff like this he's um incredible crazy man but i learned from him with home breathing and it helps strengthen my immune system my immune system happy my gut is happy and my skin is happy all right and probably the most important that i told you before jumping into skincare which is important but i will say it's funny to say from a me aesthetician and a skincare brand owner that skin care has the least impact in getting rid of rosacea we're gonna get to skincare very quickly but the most important tip that helped me and it is actually the hardest thing to do but i'm so so happy you guys excited to learn about this to know what helped the most in my rosacea journey it is when i quit alcohol nine months today and seven days as i don't drink alcohol and three months and 17 days as i quit coffee if you quit coffee where is the substitute that i wanted to show you guys uh where is that i just had somewhere i don't know where but it's called blend uh dandy blend it is coffee substitute i just i swear to god i had it here oh right here this one if you want to quit coffee then the blend it's something that you want to try tastes just like coffee tastes really really really really good no caffeine it's actually dandy dandelion tea that helps with immune system it helps to replenish your liver will deliver what i want to mention about the skin that any person that has skin issues they have to take oregon grape oregon grape cleanse your liver your liver clean you get better you feel better so coffee and alcohol when i noticed the biggest impact this is what i did experiment i did the experiment when i started like i came back when i got rosacea when i got rosacea i actually was like this is interesting what changed right now why i got rosacea the moment i remember like i came back when i started coffee i started drinking coffee two years ago this is when i started developing rosacea i'm like no that's not true then i quit coffee my rosacea was kind of disappearing then i came back to drinking coffee my rosacea came back so i don't know if that's coincidence i don't know if that's just happened but you know what no alcohol no coffee it's helping me a lot i have more energy right now than before so and quickly about skin care number one skipping morning face wash when you're disrupting all your skin like a protective lipid barrier that's not okay i don't want to go into detail because i have a like um probably like 50 videos on tech talk about skipping morning face wash why it's beneficial by the way if you're not subscribed to my tech talk june amber over there go subscribe i have right now almost 100 000 followers over there which is my biggest uh platform so if you are on tiktok come and subscribe and check out my tik tok account then face face morning face wash no in the morning at night double cleanse then you want to over hydrate instead of over exfoliating you want to over hydrate i brought my favorite hydration cream la roche posay la roche posay lippy car bomb really really great hydrates like crazy link is gonna be down below uh then exfoliating you want to exfoliate what i'm doing only once every three sometimes once every four days i just don't exfoliate my skin my skin when i'm not exfoliating not over washing yes it has some some oil but right now more normal than ever before as you see guys i don't have makeup right now here i might gonna look oily sometimes in some videos and some pictures but i rather be over hydrated and have more oil than super dry and that ages me faster and avoiding toxic irritating and produce that have just bad ingredients like parabens fragrance dyes and stuff like this so you guys know if you're not familiar with me i do have my own natural inorganic skin care brand it's called genomic beauty just wanted to show you my two favorite produce that i have it's a peptide serum it is vitamin c they both have um 98 natural 72 organic ingredients we do not use parabens no fragrance natural have a little bit weird smell but doesn't smell nice because we don't add any fragrance fragrance it's just full of heavy metals like mercury and stuff like this that irritates our skin so clean and natural skincare if you want to check out is gin under beauty and i do have also my favorite rose water spray i can spray on my hair everywhere it's really safe it's non-toxic you don't want you don't want to apply on your skin on your face something that is toxic that is irritating your skin and just wanna do everything all this together don't go like crazy don't be overwhelmed this is like a lot of stuff make sure that you actually just loving yourself first that you like okay this is going to work i'm ready i'm going to do it slow few supplements at the time start meditation with her breathing change like slowly switch all the skin care products start reading labels really when you're gonna start reading labels you're gonna pick just one brand or a couple of products that you like you don't need crazy a lot more amount of produce you just need literally like one or two antioxidants one exfoliating few cleansers like cleansing bomb and cleanser uh protection spf we are launching spf very soon i don't have it with me right now um so just start slowly believe it you can do it i did it i watched so many youtube videos like the people got rid of rosacea most of the time they all talk about how gut affects their skin all right i'm done with the rosacea and now i'm gonna go to the comments so ask me if you want something okay okay please do a video how you cure thyroid problems autoimmunities i do have like three videos how i got rid of hashimoto's thyroiditis you can guys go to my youtube channel and just enter jin amber hashimoto's thyroiditis and i do have a couple of videos how i got rid of that i have never gotten back so i'm amazing it's incredible actually this is one of the reasons why i got rid because i was consistent exercising loving myself meditating making sure i'm addressing my sleep my nervous system supplements vitamins addressing antioxidants glutathione everything you want to boost your immune system and there is many many ways how we can address but also what works for me it might not gonna work for you so you have to really test it test your foods when you eat what do you what do you what do you eat are you eating gluten and gluten is causing you really really bad you know flair up by the way when i was like sick with the hashimoto's with rosacea with all this stuff i was really really not eating gluten no dairy no sugar no sweets nothing at all i quit completely everything sometimes right now i'm eating a little bit yesterday i had gluten and i'm okay but i don't use this every single day but when i was healing this woman i cut everything especially gluten dairy and sugar these are the most inflammatory food that any person want to stop while healing so can i can't sleep naturally what natural medicine helps melatonin malaria root valerian root is really really great check out valerian roots actually they helpful for a sleep can i go to america to study with the english level b2 um i have their rest easy tincture

big big trigger you wanna avoid sugar and if you're really craving for the sweets get the banana get get grapefruit grapefruit is really really amazing what i'm doing lately actually great for grapefruit with garlic is anti-inflammatory and this actually mask the taste of the garlic i put them together i chop it off and then i drink juice on the top sometimes i add a little bit of vinegar which is helping also with stomach acid those are amazing if you're in the budget if you can buy anything like you can't do anything what i just told you at least get this and do daily at least every other day it's gonna help you at some point a little bit uh okay oh my gosh yes i love dandy blend so much so easy to taste yes how long does it take to get off old stretch marks with the body

        "transcript": "hello everybody so what you can do while you are so social distancing yourself self quarantine my Asylum just make a video so today is my first video I want to talk about rosacea or rosacea procedure how did get rid of rosacea naturally though I will be sharing some tips that I have been through that works for me because I was struggling with recession for about two years and as you can see now my face got a much clearer I don't want to remind everybody that rosacea is not something that you can cure you can only control it or keep it at bay not having it flare-up in your skin it's not something that you can cure unfortunately so number one you gotta find out what is your root cause of your rosacea so for me only happened once I've changed one of the item of my skincare routine and that was the product that triggered it but when I also go through the whole healing process I realized it was much more than just what I use in my face you know it's always it's also how I treat on my face or skincare the team before how was how I was just randomly picked something for my face without having to care about whether my face get tolerated and then the second thing which is the most important thing is you know stress what I do how did I find out I keep a very close monitor of what I was doing and eating or using every single day and until I nailed it down to stress that you know I found out it's stress that caused the pimples in my face so tips number two you gotta be patient with your own station with skin it takes time to heal so when I got diagnosed with rosacea before I had beautiful skin and I really had a struggle in dealing with or coming to the fact that you know I had no seizure before my skin was flawless and then now my skin got like bumps on the face and people saying something about my face it said something that I done and you know it was red it was bumpy the texture was rough so it was um it was a hit on my confidence you gotta really accept the fact that rosacea is not gonna go away like overnight it's not like a cold where you can take some medicine and then you'll be fine in five days it's not something like that unless it's a really mild but that's not the case for me you know I had been tackling Liat for the past two years and now you know I can find I've managed to control my rosacea I've managed to get rid of my rosacea okay number three so what kind of treatments you can get for rosacea so I've gone through a lot of treatments for me and it seems that nothing works for me now when you go to see a doctor you know they will get you diagnosed and what I was prescribed with some antibiotics for about two months two months antibiotics I think it won't really even subscribe to me he even gave me a few months of antibiotics so also the Chinese medicine the doctor would give me some cream to put on to calm down the skin the pimples I used all of them and I also did some laser treatment who make the redness go away you know I did all of them you know don't get me wrong I did all of them and it didn't work for me at all and at one point I was just so frustrated that I just stopped using everything so so how did I get rid of mobilization naturally again you know I'm gonna go back to point one once I found out what my root causes which is stress and also things that I use I really focus on it so what I did I did all things to de-stress and and I start looking into you know what cost distress in my life and it hoping like a pintar box a box of worm which I find out you know I was actually stressing myself quite a lot and at the same time when I was diagnosed with rosacea also got digestion problem so all of this is the sign of my body telling me that you know my body can't take it anymore I started stressing out every single day every time something comes up so that was my treatment really I know it sounds a bit not helpful but that was that path I got down to you know I was I was having having all these kind of treatments and at one point I've got some laser for the face to to calm down the redness on my face and after two weeks it all comes back you know my people starts to come back and everything so at the end I I really actually you know use how to de-stress meditation I was searching myself going inward to really get down to you know what where the stress is coming from and then the second thing in K so as I mentioned earlier I wasn't present - what kind of skincare was using not that was not taking care of my skin I was a skincare junkie you know I all kind of stuff because I was I was interested I was curious so when I realized I was using our system depicting stuff based on what I think would be good for my skin instead of what is that actually good for my skin so I towel down my skin community into something more natural something on my own and I still stick to it today because I see I see that you know it works for my skin so so you gotta find out you know what would be beneficial for your skin so hopefully you find this tips useful I really hope that everyone can get rid of the rosacea at the end without much effort and hassle again you know you gonna reflect what caused your rosacea so that you can get rid of it get rid of your rosacea and if you have any question for me you can ask me you know what did I use and all that so I'll be sharing what kind of skincare treatment or routine I use in my next video so if you like this video give this video a thumbs up if you want to can also subscribe to my channel this is my first video so stay safe in this situation this coronavirus and I'll speak to you again in the next video bye bye",

        "transcript": "today i'm going to share with you my rosacea story i'm going to tell you about the six stages i went through to totally eradicate my symptoms and if it worked for me then it could work for you too so keep watching because what have you got to lose except perhaps your rosacea [Music] doctors will tell you the cause of rosacea is unknown and that there's no cure they'll also tell you that your only option is to treat your symptoms with medications probably for the rest of your life and they'll also warn you the condition might worsen with age well i'm here to tell you that your doctor's rosacea diagnosis is no medical doctor ever cured rosacea the best they can hope for is to temporarily master symptoms using pharmaceuticals and in some persons these medical interventions can even worsen the condition over time but i'm going to take you down a very different path my journey with rosacea forced me to address all the potential causes of the condition and then to rectify those issues in a logical systematic manner first we need to jump back 15 years to a rather dark period in my life from rosetta first to hold now i'm sure that those of you who suffer from this adult skin condition will understand exactly what i'm about to say next because to put it bluntly rosacea truly is a curse it literally appears out of the blue generally taking hold within a very short period of time and it can absolutely dominate your life destroying your self-confidence in the process nowadays however i'm 100 rosacea free and i never suffer relapses to achieve this i made only a few simple changes in my life nothing difficult nothing expensive anyone can do it and i guarantee that anybody who follows my example will experience positive results so here's my story detailing exactly what i did to permanently eradicate my rosacea back in 2007 when i first noticed my initial rosacea symptoms i just assumed it was mild acne now that in itself was a little confusing because i hadn't had acne since i was a teenager and i was now 47 so i tried using various medicated face wash products and sport creams but they just seem to make things worse causing more redness and drying on my skin so at this point all i'm thinking is what the hell is this on my face and to make things worse at the time i was working as an anti-aging consultant being paid to give health advice to my clients so you can imagine how that must have looked would you take health advice from somebody with a red spotty complexion probably not and we would blame you so i stopped all acne treatments there and then and decided to focus my efforts on identifying the condition and hopefully getting the appropriate treatment well of course it didn't take long to figure out that rosacea was the most likely candidate so i thought great now i know what it is i'll simply get an appointment with my doctor and i'll have my lovely clear skin back in no time but oh how soon that feeling of confidence gets dashed i wonder how many of us have heard that we're following words uttered by our doctor or dermatologist there is no cure you're just going to have to live with it we have medications and creams that can help with your symptoms but you may need to use them for the rest of your life now i don't know about you but my first reaction was to hell with that scenario long-term antibiotics together with the regular use of chemical face creams these are not components that contribute to good health quite the opposite i thought but then reality sinks in and it dawns on you that perhaps you have no option because anything's better than walking around with this red spotty face right at this point in the diagnosis i was experiencing those unavoidable feelings of despair that hit you when you feel so utterly helpless so yes initially i followed the advice of the so-called skin specialist to the letter i took my daily antibiotics and i tried a selection of medicated rosacea face creams and the end result of six months on these meds little to no visible improvement the only thing that appeared to have any positive effect was azelaic acid cream but if i had to put a number on it then i'd say a 10 improvement in most and that dreams things like hell so ultimately all these useless meds were tossed in the bin there had to be a better solution and i was damn well going to find it so here's what i did first i put my work and social life on hold nothing was going to distract me from my goal of once again having clear skin now research was an integral part of my work in life extension so the process of finding and analyzing relevant data was second nature to me i trawl endlessly through research data documenting my findings as i went however it quickly became apparent that something vital was missing from these studies not a single one took a holistic approach to dealing with rosacea it was more a case of let's see what effect therapy a has compared to therapy b compared to placebo so irrespective of whether a study was blind double blind or whatever they were all pretty much focused on finding some magic bullet that would cure the condition that in my opinion is absolutely the wrong approach it certainly hasn't been successful so far so logic dictated that an entirely different way of treating the condition was necessary i deduced if i was going to have any chance of eradicating my rosacea then i was going to have to attack it holistically i decided to focus all my efforts in optimizing my immune system and overall health by systematically addressing every possible factor that might in some way be compromising it and worsening my symptoms now up until this point i consider myself to be extremely healthy and i assumed therefore that my immune function must be close to optimal well time to rethink that one i thought if my immune system was in such good shape then why had i been afflicted with rosacea something had to be amiss and i was going to find it and fix it whatever it took rosacea causes depression there can be no argument about that just ask anyone who's ever suffered from the condition the big problem with this though is that depression suppresses immune function therefore if i was to have any real chance of success it was paramount now i focus on being positive and upbeat this really is key so here's the mindset and attitude that i employed first i accepted that every medical condition has a cause therefore every medical condition must be treatable sure we may not always know what the cause is or the appropriate treatment but simply the fact that we both must exist was all the motivation i needed to see this thing through following a full analysis of my research data i decided that my rosacea treatment protocol was to include six separate interventions and i would only proceed to add the next intervention one science sufficient time to evaluate the results of the previous one that way i'd know exactly which treatment responsible for which benefits firstly i stopped using all skin cleansing products except for a liquid soap antenna for babies it contained no chemicals caused me zero skin irritation and it didn't dry out my skin it's actually still my product of choice to this day and for anyone that might want to try it i've left a link in the description below using only this one cleansing product resulted in a noticeable reduction in redness if i ever felt like my skin needed hydrating then i'd simply apply organic aloe vera gel which proved to be very cooling and caused me no irritation next i stopped all sun exposure now i have to admit this was a hard one for me water sports on the beach had always been an important part of my life but for now at least they were gonna have to be put on hold because anything longer than a couple of minutes in the sun was causing increased facial redness but i should mention that i did take a vitamin d3 supplement in order to compensate for the lack of sun exposure following that i was next forced to address my regular sauna use i'd always been a big fan of the sauna due to its many proven health benefits but i now find myself suffering increased facial redness for several hours following each session so the only option was to knock on the head for now but a little spoiler alert i'm very happy to tell you nowadays i can use a sauna without problems and i can even enjoy sensible sun exposure without skin issues of any kind but more on that later i'd estimate that the overall benefit of these three simple changes was around a 20 improvement although i'd attribute this mainly to less frequent flare-ups as opposed to any major reductions in the symptoms themselves obtaining quality sleep each and every night is quite simply an integral part of achieving optimal health however it's probably the most common factor that most people could improve on and i was no exception before rosacea struck my bedtime would vary between 11 pm to 2 a.m depending on my work schedule or my social plans but i'd always awaken by alarm clock each morning at 7 00 am now i knew from experience that a minimum of seven hours sleep and a maximum of eight seem to provide me with optimal energy levels and mental function throughout the day so here's what i did i immediately set a fixed bedtime of 11 pm but allowed myself to awaken naturally between 6 and 7 am each morning that way i was always sleeping for just as long as my body required sleep quality is without doubt one of the strongest factors influencing both our immune system health and our mental function so i saw this approach as vital it took me less than a week to properly adapt to my new sleep schedule and within the first month i was already feeling and seeing the benefits energy levels had increased and my positive attitude was boosted by a further reduction in symptoms if i had to put a number on it then i'd say another 10 improvement let me also mention that in order to benefit my sleep patterns i use the popular supplement melatonin and for a full explanation regarding how to properly use this supplement and how to optimize your sleep quality then please see my melatonin video elsewhere on this channel next it was time to deal with those nasty little demodex mites now for anyone who hasn't heard of them demodex mites also known as face mites are parasites that live in our face and hair follicles there's two types of dermadex mite and they're both invisible to the naked eye demidex brevis live on the skin and demodex follicularum on hair but here's where i got a shock a little bit of research confirmed that people with rosacea could have up to ten times as many demodex mice on their skin as those without the condition i also learned that the mites become most active in the dark and that they have several stages in their life cycle after meeting on the surface of the skin they apparently go back into it to lay eggs before dying within the skin's layers after death the demidex corpses become liquid and decompose inside the skin when each of these tiny mice dies they release bacteria into the skin and those bacteria trigger an immune response that causes redness and inflammation now one bacteria in particular carried by deminex has been shown to stimulate an immune response in those with rosacea so it seemed pretty obvious to me that deminex must surely be contributing to my symptoms thankfully getting rid of my demonics problem was fairly straightforward a quick search on google revealed that pretty much anyone who's heard of a demodex mite also knows that tea tree oil kills them effectively so i got straight to it i mixed tea tree oil with emu oil in a 50 50 mix for application to my eyebrows and eyelashes and for application to my face and scalp i used a 30 tea tree 70 emu oil mix this ratio caused me no skin sensitivity issues whatsoever now the reason why i chose emu oil as a carrier off for tea tree is because it's non-comedogenic so won't cause clogged pores it's also highly hypoallergenic possesses anti-inflammatory properties and can penetrate deep through the skin's layers allowing it to effectively target demodex brevis every night before bed for seven days straight i applied the appropriate mix of oil to my face scalp eyebrows and eyelashes then in the morning i just showered and washed it off i experienced visible improvements and by the end of the seven day treatment my skin looked noticeably smoother and clearer following that i added five percent tea tree oil to my liquid soap for daily use now this protocol resulted in a further 20 percent improvement in my rosacea symptoms i was definitely making good progress now with a 50 overall improvement so far reports of certain foods causing rosacea flare-ups are commonplace and a quick search on google will provide a list of the most commonly reported problematic foods now at the time i wasn't really aware of consuming anything in particular that exacerbated my own rosacea other than perhaps alcohol which i'd already cut out however i still decided to try as an experiment i selected one food group at a time and totally eliminated that food from my diet for a period of four weeks in order to gauge any improvements but nothing appeared to make any noticeable difference not until this happened i eliminated dairy within three weeks the difference was significant after two months of being dairy free i could finally see light at the end of the tunnel i'd estimate that i was now 80 free of all rosacea symptoms three months into my dairy free experiment i decided to try reintroducing cheese to see what might happen within only a few days mild symptoms were returning which only served to confirm the effect that dairy was having on my condition my dietary strategy of needing to cure rosacea was based on optimizing my nutritional intake in a way that would also optimize my gut microbiome as we now know our microbiome is often referred to as our second brain influencing everything from our thoughts to our immune system health so in addition to carrying out the food group elimination tests i also made sure to avoid all processed foods primarily selecting whole foods in as close to the original form as possible now during this past decade my diet has been leaning towards vegan but i do occasionally still eat meat fish and eggs especially eating out if i were looking to put a label in my dietary practices then i'd probably classify myself as a nutritarian eating to satisfy nutrient requirements above all else nutritional supplements had always been an important part of my personal health program and i always considered a high quality daily multivitamin to be a necessity in order to cover any dietary deficiencies however i was now being forced to look at supplements from a slightly different perspective which supplements in particular would most benefit the appearance of my skin two supplements stood out the first supplement i chose was a peripheral antioxidant called astaxanthin it's a darkly pigmented substance which is produced by a particular type of microbe microalgae and it's the reason why salmon weeds are pink astaxanthin's powerful anti-inflammatory effects can also help calm the inflammation in rosacea and it's been shown to provide a useful degree of uv protection with its natural carotenoid pigments even adding a healthy color to the skin several studies have also shown beneficial effects in relation to wrinkles and skin moisture levels now i noticed the benefits of taking the supplement within a very short period of time and it continues to take it to this day one daily four milligram capsule is all is required and if you'd like to know more about this amazing supplement then you can watch my detailed astaxanthin video elsewhere on this channel the second supplement i chose to take was iodine and here was my reasoning i learned that iodine deficiency in the developed world had increased considerably over the last 40 years and i also noted the apparent steady increase in the rate of rosacea during the same period with the condition now afflicting over 400 million adults worldwide now i knew that iodine was highly important for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland which in turn has a direct influence over the appearance of our skin but what i hadn't been aware of are two reasons why i might be iodine deficient firstly i simply might not be getting enough iodine from my diet and secondly what i was ingesting might be getting blocked by three other elements from the same mineral family those being fluoride bromide and chlorine fluoride is often added to the water supply and it's also a common additive for most toothpaste products bromide is present in pesticides it's often used as a food additive in flower and you can even find it lurking in many personal care products and chlorine well it's present in drinking water swimming pools and jacuzzis now the big problem is this chlorine bromide and fluoride all compete for the same receptors that are used in the thyroid gland to capture iodine ultimately this can inhibit thyroid hormone production with the resultant low thyroid state but here's where it gets really interesting there's actually several other tissues that absorb and utilize iodine and these tissues include the skin so if i did have an iodine deficiency it certainly wasn't going to be benefiting my rosacea condition my solution was to immediately begin supplementing with six milligrams of iodine daily which research indicated was sufficient to ensure that my thyroid and affected tissues had the necessary levels available to function correctly i also made efforts to eliminate exposure to fluoride bromide and chlorine one month into my skin supplement protocol and my condition had continued to improve i'd estimate i was now 90 rosacea free and to be honest if the texture of my skin had just been a little bit better then i've considered myself to have returned to as my pre-rosacea state however i did have one last stage to go and this final stage turned out to be exactly what i needed in order to achieve my goal the final part of my six days protocol was to eliminate any chemical toxins stored within my fat cells we're all exposed to these toxins on a daily basis through the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat even the personal care products we put on our hair and skin the problem is that over time excesses of these toxins can accumulate in our fat cells and they can include such things as endocrine disruptors carcinogens even skin irritants so i figured that irrespective of whether or not they might be affecting my rosacea condition getting rid of them could only be a good thing my research indicated that the one and only truly effective protocol for eliminating chemical toxins stored within human fat cells was a detox developed by dr george ew this protocol was used by rescue workers suffering from toxic chemical inhalation following in 9 11 attacks and it proved to be highly effective shortly after dr you tweaked the protocol for use by the general adult population and is now extremely popular with anti-aging and life extension enthusiasts now initially i was a bit apprehensive about trying this detox because it does require the use of the sauna and the last thing i wanted to experience at this point was a setback however i needn't have worried it now appeared at the extreme heat of the sauna was no longer having any negative effect whatsoever on my rosacea condition quite the opposite in fact with every sauna detox session my skin was becoming closer to 100 percent clear now i'm not going to spend time here describing doctor use detox rather i'll direct you to a detailed video i made in the subject elsewhere on this channel but what i will tell you right now is this the results of this detox with regard to your overall health and the appearance of your skin can be truly transformational to this day i still repeat doctor use sonnet detox once a month in order to prevent any further toxin build up and i still take regular saunas several times a week so that was my sixth stage rosacea protocol in a nutshell to the best of my knowledge those who have tried it have all had worthwhile results and some have even experienced a complete and permanent reversal of their symptoms fast forward to 2022 i'm still 100 rosacea free and have been for the past 12 years it appears that my skin together with those underlying factors that were causing my rosacea have now fully reverted to their pre-rosacea state but the most remarkable change for me is that sunshine saunas alcohol stress even berry appear to no longer pose any threat to my clear skin however i would point out that for health reasons i choose to rarely consume dairy or alcohol the bottom line is this if you want to effectively deal with your rosacea condition then it really does require a totally holistic approach in reality this applies not only to rosacea but to our health in general perhaps if our doctors were better educated in these facts then they wouldn't be so hasty in prescribing medications because there's generally far more effective routes to achieving good health than popping pills i really do wish you the very best of luck in dealing with your rosacea condition and i'd love to hear your comments regarding your progress in dealing with this dramatic affliction the sharing of such information can only serve to benefit us all i'm wrecker black many thanks for watching and if you enjoyed this presentation then please like subscribe and comment it really does help the channel grow and as always take care be healthy and see you again soon [Music]",

dive into this video i really really hope it\u00a0\nhelps you out because rosacea sucks all right so a\u00a0\u00a0 little background about me and rosacea and all of\u00a0\nthat i was like i said it was probably about like\u00a0\u00a0 six or seven years ago now that i noticed my skin\u00a0\nwas just really becoming like red and inflamed i\u00a0\u00a0 was getting all these little like red bumps and\u00a0\ni went to the dermatologist and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 was like yeah you have rosacea and i just remember\u00a0\nthem telling me that and i was like oh my gosh\u00a0\u00a0 like i've you know seen people with rosacea i've\u00a0\nheard all about it and i never thought it would\u00a0\u00a0 you know hit me and hit my skin but i was starting\u00a0\nto see all these things and i just remember being\u00a0\u00a0 like oh my gosh like no this cannot be happening\u00a0\nand i went to a couple different dermatologists\u00a0\u00a0 this was all the way back when i was in atlanta um\u00a0\nand they also the same thing they're like yes it's\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea there's nothing you can do about it it's\u00a0\nincurable you just have to manage it and they all\u00a0\u00a0 wanted to throw like medication and antibiotics\u00a0\nat me and at the time like i said i honestly had\u00a0\u00a0 no idea what to do so i started taking antibiotics\u00a0\nand yeah i mean it controlled it to somewhat and\u00a0\u00a0 it helped it clear my skin somewhat but you can't\u00a0\nstay on antibiotics long and i'm going to even\u00a0\u00a0 share with you why it's the worst idea to take\u00a0\nantibiotics if you have rosacea i'm going to share\u00a0\u00a0 that with you shortly but to make a long story\u00a0\nshort when you go to a dermatologist that's all\u00a0\u00a0 they want to do is they want to throw prescription\u00a0\nmedications at you prescription topical products\u00a0\u00a0 at you and prescription you know like antibiotics\u00a0\nand internal prescriptions which that so as i\u00a0\u00a0 continued on and you know my whole little journey\u00a0\nwith this i was just like no like something\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't doesn't seem right there's no way this is\u00a0\nyou know incurable you know i had dermatologists\u00a0\u00a0 tell me that it was like mites on my skin and just\u00a0\nlike dermatologists don't even know why people get\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea like i i went to so many different doctors\u00a0\nand they all said the same thing they're like yeah\u00a0\u00a0 we don't really know what causes rosacea but we do\u00a0\nknow that it's a skin condition that you just have\u00a0\u00a0 to live with and it's you there's no cure and\u00a0\ni was like no like i'm not gonna deal with this\u00a0\u00a0 like i'm not gonna be on medications for the rest\u00a0\nof my life for skin issues like no like there's\u00a0\u00a0 got to be something to this so i really really\u00a0\nstarted researching and i remember laying in bed\u00a0\u00a0 at all hours of the night and just researching\u00a0\nresearching what other people have done and\u00a0\u00a0 researching um just everything that i could figure\u00a0\nout about this skin condition which actually led\u00a0\u00a0 me to osmosis and this was like i said like six or\u00a0\nseven years ago osmosis was like a tiny company no\u00a0\u00a0 one heard of osmosis i reached out to the company\u00a0\nbecause i read a lot of good things about them\u00a0\u00a0 on just like little blogs here and there and i\u00a0\nread like little like rosacea blogs and people\u00a0\u00a0 were saying how it really you know this brand was\u00a0\nlike the one brand that really helped their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and they were like these tiny little blogs that i\u00a0\nhad to like dig through so much research to find\u00a0\u00a0 because i said i've never heard of osmosis no\u00a0\none did back then so i reached out to osmosis\u00a0\u00a0 and become became started to become you know\u00a0\nfriends with ben johnson ben johnson he's been\u00a0\u00a0 on my channel now for years he's a really good\u00a0\nfriend of mine now but i reached out to him and i\u00a0\u00a0 remember having conversations with him about like\u00a0\nmy skin in particular and all kinds of stuff again\u00a0\u00a0 long story short ben johnson the formulator of\u00a0\nosmosis skincare is very holistic and he's the one\u00a0\u00a0 that put into my mind he's like no brianna like\u00a0\nyou're going about things the wrong way rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is internal it's like an internal issue that you\u00a0\nhave to fix from the inside out and everything\u00a0\u00a0 clicked everything he said made so much sense\u00a0\nso i started taking his advice and everything\u00a0\u00a0 in my life just completely turned around what i\u00a0\nlearned is that rosacea is an internal imbalance\u00a0\u00a0 it's gut health it is all about gut health and\u00a0\ninflammation in your gut and all of that and\u00a0\u00a0 once you have that figured out you can clear your\u00a0\nskin and that is not even just with rosacea it is\u00a0\u00a0 with acne it's with so many other skin conditions\u00a0\nmy son is 14 and was getting really bad acne we\u00a0\u00a0 completely changed around his diet put him on the\u00a0\nright supplements and he has really clear skin now\u00a0\u00a0 you can clear a skin condition including rosacea\u00a0\nit is not an incurable skin condition you can cure\u00a0\u00a0 it with internal balance so basically what's going\u00a0\non is you know you don't just wake up with rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 one morning it's an ongoing thing that's happening\u00a0\nin your body and the funny thing is i've always\u00a0\u00a0 had like like gut issues and digestion issues and\u00a0\nall of that bloating i would get like really bad\u00a0\u00a0 stomach aches sometimes and you know we're so busy\u00a0\nin our daily lives you don't even like really stop\u00a0\u00a0 to listen to your body your body is always telling\u00a0\nyou something and your skin is a representation\u00a0\u00a0 of what's going on in your body your skin is\u00a0\na representation of the health that's going\u00a0\u00a0 on inside your body and once you really begin\u00a0\nto learn that and begin to listen to your body\u00a0\u00a0 it all makes sense so rosacea stems from your gut\u00a0\nand like i said it's not something you just wake\u00a0\u00a0 up with one day and you're like oh crap like\u00a0\ni have rosacea now it doesn't happen like that\u00a0\u00a0 it's something that you know takes a while to\u00a0\nreally start to come out in your skin it's you\u00a0\u00a0 know all these little digestion issues it's your\u00a0\ngut health it's like you know food intolerances\u00a0\u00a0 are a big thing i actually took myself off dairy\u00a0\nand gluten to begin my whole journey with and that\u00a0\u00a0 helped a lot because i did find out i had um\u00a0\nintolerances to both gluten and dairy i'll get\u00a0\u00a0 into all that as well but once you really start\u00a0\nto realize that rosacea stems from the inside\u00a0\u00a0 and it's the inflammation it's the toxins that are\u00a0\nbuilding up within your gut and your digestion and\u00a0\u00a0 you know all of that once you figure that\u00a0\nout you can clear your skin and that is so\u00a0\u00a0 key so let's talk about the three steps that you\u00a0\nneed to take to cure your rosacea like cure your\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea for good step number one is diet now i\u00a0\npersonally went to a functional medicine doctor\u00a0\u00a0 um there was a place in atlanta that i went to\u00a0\na functional medicine like a holistic doctor\u00a0\u00a0 and it completely changed my life like i got\u00a0\nlike blood work done i got all of these you\u00a0\u00a0 know food intolerances done but what i really\u00a0\nlearned and it's the exact same thing that i\u00a0\u00a0 learned from talking to dr ben johnson is that\u00a0\nyour body can heal itself like i said everything\u00a0\u00a0 that's like going on in your body it will come\u00a0\nout on your skin if you have toxins building up\u00a0\u00a0 if you have inflammation it's going to come out\u00a0\non your skin and honestly going to a functional\u00a0\u00a0 medicine doctor is just so like eye opening and\u00a0\ni love it like i still go to a functional doctor\u00a0\u00a0 today just to keep up with like my blood work and\u00a0\njust to see how things are going you know like\u00a0\u00a0 i go to a normal like physicals you know i go to\u00a0\nmy normal women's physical doctors and stuff but i\u00a0\u00a0 always go to my functional medicine doctor for\u00a0\nlike the blood work and they just dive into so\u00a0\u00a0 much and they just have such a different approach\u00a0\nto healing the body in a different approach to to\u00a0\u00a0 medicine because i think i think we as like humans\u00a0\nwe are bombarded with like prescriptions upon\u00a0\u00a0 prescriptions upon prescriptions when our bodies\u00a0\nare meant to heal themselves and our bodies are\u00a0\u00a0 showing signs of distress all the time but we just\u00a0\nhave to take the time to listen to what they are\u00a0\u00a0 and rosacea acne it's a sign that something is off\u00a0\nin your body and you have to take that as a sign\u00a0\u00a0 that something's going on you know it's not just\u00a0\na skin condition that pops up it's not something\u00a0\u00a0 that just happens that's you know mites on\u00a0\nyour skin that's incurable no it is a sign\u00a0\u00a0 from inside your body like hey something's going\u00a0\non here you guys like something's not you know in\u00a0\u00a0 balance something's going on like look internal\u00a0\nwhich i think is amazing i think it's so awesome\u00a0\u00a0 that our bodies do that so step number one like\u00a0\ni was saying is diet i really went hardcore into\u00a0\u00a0 diet at this time because i really really wanted\u00a0\nto take out everything that i could to balance out\u00a0\u00a0 issues you know that i was having so\u00a0\ni took out the gluten i took out dairy\u00a0\u00a0 which the functional medicine doctor and dr ben\u00a0\njohnson both said those two things are a huge\u00a0\u00a0 cause for so many people and skin conditions so i\u00a0\ntook those out of my diet completely and i i eat\u00a0\u00a0 clean like i still eat really clean and healthy\u00a0\nto this day but i made sure like back then i\u00a0\u00a0 just didn't cheat at all i just kept everything\u00a0\ngluten free dairy free and just ate very clean\u00a0\u00a0 and i can tell you that made a big difference\u00a0\nreally look at your diet take out you know\u00a0\u00a0 take out the dairy take out the gluten you can\u00a0\nlive without those two i promise you both of those\u00a0\u00a0 create such inflammation within our bodies that\u00a0\nit comes out in your skin and again it's something\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't see overnight you're not going to\u00a0\njust eat a piece of pizza and then tomorrow have\u00a0\u00a0 you know acne or rosacea it doesn't work like that\u00a0\nit takes a long time for your body to build up\u00a0\u00a0 all that inflammation and you know really throw\u00a0\noff your gut health it's not an overnight thing\u00a0\u00a0 but once you start to take those you know those\u00a0\nfactors out of your diet your body from the inside\u00a0\u00a0 will really start to heal and repair itself second\u00a0\nand this is a huge one for me is supplements\u00a0\u00a0 i really did not take any supplements back in\u00a0\nthe day and if you're familiar with me and my\u00a0\u00a0 channel now i talk about supplements all the time\u00a0\nbecause they changed my life they changed my skin\u00a0\u00a0 supplements are key so even with my son\u00a0\nlike i said he's 14 was dealing with acne\u00a0\u00a0 i put him on certain supplements and\u00a0\nit's what really really cleared his skin\u00a0\u00a0 so you can slap all the different skincare\u00a0\nproducts on that you want but if you're not\u00a0\u00a0 fixing internal issues you're never going to\u00a0\nhave the most beautiful perfect skin because\u00a0\u00a0 you're not you're always be playing catch up\u00a0\nwith what's going on internally you have to have\u00a0\u00a0 internal balance and then use your topical skin\u00a0\ncare products as like icing on the cake and\u00a0\u00a0 they both work together to create like amazing\u00a0\nbeautiful healthy skin so supplements to me are\u00a0\u00a0 like no joke i take my supplements every single\u00a0\nday i take a lot of supplements um but honestly\u00a0\u00a0 it's necessary because we are getting we're eating\u00a0\nfood that's you know grown in certain ways there's\u00a0\u00a0 all these like our food is not like real food\u00a0\nlike it was back in the long time ago days you\u00a0\u00a0 know like we're growing food and soils that have\u00a0\nall these like chemicals and just everything is so\u00a0\u00a0 different with our foods that our bodies aren't\u00a0\ngetting the nutrients that that they need it's\u00a0\u00a0 creating toxins and and you know imbalances within\u00a0\nour gut and that's what leads to a lot of people\u00a0\u00a0 having skin conditions skin conditions are on the\u00a0\nrise because of the foods we eat because we're not\u00a0\u00a0 really supplementing and taking care of our gut\u00a0\nand our health internally so supplements are key\u00a0\u00a0 and the key supplements that you really really\u00a0\nwant to look for i'm going to share with you\u00a0\u00a0 exactly what i recommend to take if you have\u00a0\nrosacea because these will change your life\u00a0\u00a0 the first one that i'm going to talk about is\u00a0\nthis because this is a must you guys it's the\u00a0\u00a0 osmosis skin clarifier 10 day blemish cleanse\u00a0\nso i always joke with ben i'm like it shouldn't\u00a0\u00a0 really be called blemish cleanse because it's\u00a0\nhonestly good for all skin types no matter even\u00a0\u00a0 if you have a skin condition or not it's so good\u00a0\nthough for acne and rosacea people like it really\u00a0\u00a0 clears your skin so it's a 10-day cleanse and what\u00a0\nthis does is it pulls every like toxin and gunk\u00a0\u00a0 out of your like track like your digestion and\u00a0\nyour gut which is that's where skin conditions\u00a0\u00a0 start from its digestion and its gut health so\u00a0\nthis cleanse i mean it doesn't make you like\u00a0\u00a0 run to the bathroom every five seconds or anything\u00a0\nthere's no like weird side effects like that\u00a0\u00a0 at all but you will notice it in your skin so\u00a0\nit's a 10 day cleanse now if you have rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 i highly suggest three back-to-back cleanses if\u00a0\nyou're just starting out with like you know curing\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea you need three of these back-to-back\u00a0\nso it's gonna be 30 days of taking eight pills in\u00a0\u00a0 the morning and eight pills at night but it\u00a0\nis worth it because this will save your skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is the first step to really really just\u00a0\ncleaning out all the gunk that has been built\u00a0\u00a0 up in your digestion and in your gut and there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market this is actually\u00a0\u00a0 like a mucus cleanse basically because again so\u00a0\nmany foods that we eat our bodies are creating you\u00a0\u00a0 know its own mucus all the time but so much like\u00a0\nyou know dairy and just foods that we eat actually\u00a0\u00a0 cause more mucus in our bodies and a lot of times\u00a0\nmucus built up in your body is a form of like\u00a0\u00a0 like inflammation too so um it you have like\u00a0\na build up of mucus and it's always lining our\u00a0\u00a0 digestion in our gut and this is cleans it out\u00a0\nlike this is like we'll clean out all of that\u00a0\u00a0 so it's a must it's the very very first step to\u00a0\ngetting clear skin if you have rosacea now for me\u00a0\u00a0 personally i do still take this a hundred percent\u00a0\ni take this like every other month but i usually\u00a0\u00a0 only do one to two back to back instead of the\u00a0\nthree but again if you're just starting out with\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea and you really wanna work to clear it\u00a0\nyou're gonna wanna start with the highest dose\u00a0\u00a0 which is three back-to-back cleanses then these\u00a0\nare the other ones that i highly suggest you guys\u00a0\u00a0 the truth treatments blemish repair complex\u00a0\namazing for rosacea amazing for acne my son\u00a0\u00a0 takes this every single day and it really\u00a0\nreally helps his skin as well i take this\u00a0\u00a0 every single day i will never be without this\u00a0\nthis is a supplement that i take every day\u00a0\u00a0 whereas this you know skin cleanse is more of like\u00a0\na cleanse and i take that cleanse like every other\u00a0\u00a0 month or so just to really clean out everything\u00a0\nand to keep all the gum buildup all of that\u00a0\u00a0 this is more along the lines of like the perfect\u00a0\ningredients that your skin needs to stay healthy\u00a0\u00a0 i mean this has your vitamin a it's got all your\u00a0\ndifferent vitamin b's vitamin d3 it has chromium\u00a0\u00a0 selenium copper zinc nack nac like truly\u00a0\ntruly everything that your skin needs to stay\u00a0\u00a0 balanced to have clear amazing skin so whether\u00a0\nyou have acne rather you have rosacea this is a\u00a0\u00a0 supplement that you have to take daily because it\u00a0\nwill 100 100 help your skin that's a must as well\u00a0\u00a0 as the truth treatments the fulvic cellular\u00a0\nrepair complex so this is literally all your\u00a0\u00a0 minerals your nutrients it's got fulvic acid but\u00a0\nit's got so much like necessary like amino acids\u00a0\u00a0 and nutrients that your body cannot get it can't\u00a0\nabsorb from the foods that we eat on a daily basis\u00a0\u00a0 and this makes a huge difference with like\u00a0\nbringing down the redness and the inflammation in\u00a0\u00a0 your skin it's amazing this is definitely one that\u00a0\nyou want to be taking every single day as well and\u00a0\u00a0 then these two are a must now i have been taking\u00a0\nprobiotics forever ever since i started my like\u00a0\u00a0 supplement journey probiotic daily is a must for\u00a0\ngut health you have to be a probiotic prebiotic\u00a0\u00a0 absolute must now i've gone through\u00a0\nso many in the past however many years\u00a0\u00a0 this is the one i'm using right now and i swear\u00a0\nthere is no probiotic slash prebiotic better\u00a0\u00a0 than this one i have felt such a difference\u00a0\nsince being on this i've been taking this for\u00a0\u00a0 maybe like three to four months now and it's\u00a0\ninsane i feel so good like i always have to\u00a0\u00a0 deal with like bloating and digestion issues\u00a0\nall of that and ever since i started taking this\u00a0\u00a0 there's none of that i take this before bed and\u00a0\ni literally like wake up i have like my stomach's\u00a0\u00a0 flat not bloated there's so many times like i will\u00a0\neat like crappy food that i know i shouldn't be\u00a0\u00a0 eating for dinner or something and i know like\u00a0\nhalf the time i would wake up and just be like\u00a0\u00a0 bloated and gross afterwards not with this like\u00a0\nthere's been none of that since i've been taking\u00a0\u00a0 this and it just i feel like light inside like\u00a0\ni feel good and it also really controls like\u00a0\u00a0 being regular if you know what i mean a lot of\u00a0\npeople who have digestion issues and gut issues\u00a0\u00a0 that is a big thing and that is a huge thing\u00a0\nfor skin issues you have to like keep everything\u00a0\u00a0 moving so that nothing's like building up\u00a0\nand not gonna be coming out on your skin\u00a0\u00a0 toxins are always going to find a way to come out\u00a0\non your skin a prebiotic probiotic is a must and\u00a0\u00a0 this is something i will never be without as well\u00a0\nand honestly the symbiotica probiotic this is the\u00a0\u00a0 best thing for gut health probiotic wise ever\u00a0\nso this is a must anyone everyone should be on a\u00a0\u00a0 probiotic but if you have acne if you have rosacea\u00a0\nthat means you are struggling with gut health\u00a0\u00a0 and this is needed daily and the other thing that\u00a0\ni want to mention is the osmosis digestive support\u00a0\u00a0 enzymes the digestive enzymes they actually come\u00a0\nin a different packaging now i have some backups\u00a0\u00a0 of the old packaging but the digestive enzymes\u00a0\nby osmosis are amazing the best digestive enzymes\u00a0\u00a0 i've ever used you can take one or two of these\u00a0\nbefore every meal and it just helps your body\u00a0\u00a0 to digest so you start losing like your natural\u00a0\nenzymes to break up food you lose them as you get\u00a0\u00a0 older so that's why you notice a lot more like\u00a0\ndigestion issues and gut issues and bloating as\u00a0\u00a0 you get older so a lot of times it's so necessary\u00a0\nto supplement with the right enzymes to really\u00a0\u00a0 help break down that food and to really help your\u00a0\nbody absorb the nutrients that it's that it's you\u00a0\u00a0 know taking in if you don't you're like losing\u00a0\nthem or it's building up in like toxin waste\u00a0\u00a0 in your body and stuff so digestive enzymes are\u00a0\ndefinitely you know i would say along the lines\u00a0\u00a0 of everything i take here it's a must as well i\u00a0\ndo think these core ones that i talked about first\u00a0\u00a0 are your most key components but if you have the\u00a0\nextra time or the extra want for digestive enzymes\u00a0\u00a0 they definitely do make a difference you will\u00a0\ndefinitely notice a difference and just taking\u00a0\u00a0 this before every meal really really helps so\u00a0\nthat is another key factor so we have number one\u00a0\u00a0 really look at your diet number two you have\u00a0\nto supplement you have to get your gut health\u00a0\u00a0 in check you have to be on the right supplements\u00a0\nit's going to make a huge difference for your skin\u00a0\u00a0 number one in my book at this point in my skin\u00a0\njourney supplements is the key for me if i get off\u00a0\u00a0 my supplements i notice a difference with my skin\u00a0\nto this day because stuff starts to not work and i\u00a0\u00a0 get you know off balance internally supplements\u00a0\nare that that important all right so step three\u00a0\u00a0 final step that you really need to take to cure\u00a0\nyour rosacea is again your topical skin care\u00a0\u00a0 so we start with the internal and then it does\u00a0\nmatter you know what skincare you use topically\u00a0\u00a0 and again that is how i discovered osmosis way\u00a0\nback in the day before anyone knew of osmosis um\u00a0\u00a0 i love this brand to this day i've been using this\u00a0\nbrand for honestly like six or seven years now\u00a0\u00a0 whenever i discover them which if you've been with\u00a0\nmy channel for a long time you remember that and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it was probably about seven years ago\u00a0\nthat is how long i've used this brand and it's\u00a0\u00a0 amazing not only do i love like the osmosis\u00a0\napproach because everything's more holistic\u00a0\u00a0 ben johnson is like ahead of his time he's\u00a0\nbeen using formulations and ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 that are only now like people are like oh yeah\u00a0\nlike retinaldehyde that's like a amazing form\u00a0\u00a0 of vitamin a like there's a lot of like his\u00a0\ningredients that are only now people are like\u00a0\u00a0 oh i'm starting to hear about this ingredient\u00a0\nthey've been in osmosis for years and their\u00a0\u00a0 products work so beyond amazing because of it um\u00a0\nbut the brand itself is very holistic and very\u00a0\u00a0 different than a lot of skincare brands\u00a0\nout there so osmosis is all about\u00a0\u00a0 you know no inflammation to your skin he does\u00a0\nnot believe in ripping apart the skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 there are so many brands out there that are harsh\u00a0\nthat are using harsh products or harsh ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 and they're ripping apart your skin barrier\u00a0\nthey're promoting inflammation to your skin and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation is something we don't want we don't\u00a0\nwant inflammation internally but we also don't\u00a0\u00a0 want to be you know inflaming our skin barrier all\u00a0\nthe time either which a lot of skin care brands do\u00a0\u00a0 so that is why um the osmosis products work\u00a0\namazing if you have rosacea because they\u00a0\u00a0 it completely changed my skin like this\u00a0\nline completely changed my skin once i\u00a0\u00a0 you know started balancing you know my internal\u00a0\nissues out with supplements and then using\u00a0\u00a0 the osmosis products topically that is where\u00a0\ni was like wow like i saw insane changes and\u00a0\u00a0 that is what's got me to my skin today so osmosis\u00a0\nproducts the ones that i will say are an absolute\u00a0\u00a0 must if you want to cure your rosacea are going\u00a0\nto be these rescue you guys heard me talk about\u00a0\u00a0 this so much if you are familiar with my\u00a0\nchannel this is all about epidermal repair\u00a0\u00a0 and knocking out inflammation there's nothing like\u00a0\nthis on the market either this truly truly knocks\u00a0\u00a0 out inflammation from deep within your skin\u00a0\nand you need to get rid of that if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea you have a lot of inflammation going\u00a0\non in your skin this is going to knock out the\u00a0\u00a0 redness this is going to help with like the\u00a0\npores and the bumps all of that you need to\u00a0\u00a0 get rid of that inflammation and knock it out\u00a0\nand this is a must this will save your skin\u00a0\u00a0 also the vitamin a's the osmosis vitamin a\u00a0\nproducts again retinaldehyde so much better than\u00a0\u00a0 retinol retinol is still inflaming your skin your\u00a0\nretinol is less potent than your retinaldehydes\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not even as powerful you know you know\u00a0\nin terms of getting that anti-aging effect\u00a0\u00a0 um but retinol is also like i said you're\u00a0\ngonna get peeling you're gonna get flaky\u00a0\u00a0 skin retinaldehyde has no peeling no flaking and\u00a0\nit's truly like one conversion away in the skin\u00a0\u00a0 to retinoic acid so it's amazing for anti-aging\u00a0\nit's been clinically studied again more and more\u00a0\u00a0 for formulators and dermatologists are like oh my\u00a0\ngosh retinaldehyde like that's an ingredient like\u00a0\u00a0 everybody should be talking about using it's like\u00a0\nthe future of vitamin a but osmosis again has been\u00a0\u00a0 using retinal to hide as their vitamin a forever\u00a0\nnow when i first started osmosis when i had\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea i was using calm so calm is your lowest\u00a0\nstrength right now to hide but it changed my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like it literally changed my skin it was so\u00a0\namazing because not only is it your vitamin a and\u00a0\u00a0 like anti-aging but there's so many calming and\u00a0\nlike anti-inflammatory ingredients and it's just\u00a0\u00a0 amazing like for your skin so i highly recommend\u00a0\nit and if you are you know dealing with rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 start with the calm again i'm using renu now which\u00a0\nis the highest strength but i did work my way\u00a0\u00a0 up to that so you basically just pump you\u00a0\nknow some out on your finger you do need the\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist this is part of the whole\u00a0\nliposomal delivery system which is amazing\u00a0\u00a0 it's the best form of delivery system for skin\u00a0\ncare that you can possibly find liposomal delivery\u00a0\u00a0 system if a skin care has that you know they're\u00a0\nlegit because that is the best form that really\u00a0\u00a0 takes the actives of every product and delivers\u00a0\nthem to the skin cell and it stays active the\u00a0\u00a0 liposomal delivery system will draw in that active\u00a0\nand keep it active the whole time it's traveling\u00a0\u00a0 through your skin whereas a lot of other products\u00a0\na lot of brands out there sephora to name a few\u00a0\u00a0 they don't even have delivery systems um\u00a0\nbut then there's other delivery systems that\u00a0\u00a0 will pull the product or the active through your\u00a0\nskin but the active ingredient loses its potency\u00a0\u00a0 you know as it's traveling through to the skin\u00a0\ncell so liposomal delivery system again another\u00a0\u00a0 key component to skin care and it makes another\u00a0\nreason you know it makes the osmosis products\u00a0\u00a0 so so effective but like i was saying when you're\u00a0\nusing their vitamin a serums again rosacea start\u00a0\u00a0 with calm but you will absolutely love it you take\u00a0\na pump of it and then you missed some of the boost\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist with it and then you massage it\u00a0\ninto your skin that's all you have to do but the\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist is needed with it because it is\u00a0\npart of the product and the whole delivery aspect\u00a0\u00a0 stop using your retin-a stop using your retinols\u00a0\nthey're ripping apart your skin and when you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea you are all about anti-inflammatory\u00a0\nproducts and you have to really take care of\u00a0\u00a0 your skin barrier this is one thing that i really\u00a0\nreally started focusing on was my skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 because a lot of times with people you know who\u00a0\nhave rosacea they have a broken down skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 it's you know irritated it's more inflamed and\u00a0\nyou have to build up your skin barrier it's a must\u00a0\u00a0 so many times you know rosacea acne patients\u00a0\nand people they have a broken down skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 one because those skin conditions cause kind of\u00a0\na breakdown in the skin barrier but two is like\u00a0\u00a0 you just don't know what you're using and you're\u00a0\nusing too harsh of ingredients and you really have\u00a0\u00a0 to baby your skin stop exfoliating stop the crazy\u00a0\nretinols and the retin-a and stuff like that and\u00a0\u00a0 just really baby your skin and really really focus\u00a0\non skin barrier health that's key to where you\u00a0\u00a0 you know really want to start as well and the two\u00a0\nproducts i would recommend for really building\u00a0\u00a0 up your skin barrier sente dermal repair ultra\u00a0\nnourish use this at night you can use it during\u00a0\u00a0 the day as well as your moisturizer but it's got\u00a0\neverything in it that your skin needs to create a\u00a0\u00a0 healthy skin bear it makes such a difference and\u00a0\ni promise you once you really start taking care\u00a0\u00a0 of your skin and using the correct products\u00a0\nand really focusing on skin barrier health\u00a0\u00a0 you will see a difference as well night and day\u00a0\nwith your rosacea this is a product that i used\u00a0\u00a0 way back when i had rosacea and it made such a\u00a0\ndifference you guys and i actually have not talked\u00a0\u00a0 about this recently it's the osmosis immerse and\u00a0\nit's a emu oil facial oil and i've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this years ago because it honestly made a huge\u00a0\ndifference with my skin so it's an emu oil based\u00a0\u00a0 facial product and it's very anti-inflammatory it\u00a0\nliterally knocks out inflammation but at the same\u00a0\u00a0 time hydrates your skin so amazing and the other\u00a0\ningredients that he has in here are just kind of\u00a0\u00a0 like more natural ingredients like more natural\u00a0\ntype of anti-inflammatory ingredients and it makes\u00a0\u00a0 a huge difference with your rosacea you will\u00a0\nnotice that your skin will start to clear\u00a0\u00a0 up and i swear by this product and then the\u00a0\nlast thing that i would definitely suggest is\u00a0\u00a0 a product like this which is your dna repair\u00a0\nso osmosis has the catalyst ac 11 dna repair\u00a0\u00a0 but then the photozyme md the dna repair brand\u00a0\nas well you need dna repair because it's again\u00a0\u00a0 helping to heal your skin from within dna repair\u00a0\nreally helps with like facial redness and also\u00a0\u00a0 broken capillaries all of that will actually help\u00a0\nto heal itself with dna repair so that is a must\u00a0\u00a0 as well again when you're thinking skincare\u00a0\nand you're really starting you know from the\u00a0\u00a0 very beginning of curing your rosacea stay away\u00a0\nfrom exfoliating for a while and then also stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from like harsh like ingredients stay away\u00a0\nfrom your retin-a's stay away from your retinols\u00a0\u00a0 work on your skin bearer and use skin barrier\u00a0\nlike anti-inflammatory products osmosis will be\u00a0\u00a0 your best friend i can promise you that um and\u00a0\nthat's where i am today that is everything i'm\u00a0\u00a0 doing that's everything i've done with my skin and\u00a0\nlike i said honestly now after all these years i\u00a0\u00a0 actually can eat some dairy and i can eat some\u00a0\ngluten because my body is balanced out i am\u00a0\u00a0 constantly like i said taking the skin the skin\u00a0\ncleanse skin clarifier cleanse i take that every\u00a0\u00a0 other month to make sure everything is cleaned out\u00a0\nin my track you know my digestion track and all of\u00a0\u00a0 that so it allows me to you know not be so strict\u00a0\nwith my diet but that's me now i can only get away\u00a0\u00a0 with doing that now because i've really you know\u00a0\ntook control and balanced everything out it is all\u00a0\u00a0 about balancing internal issues so step one diet\u00a0\nstep two key key issue is supplements get on those\u00a0\u00a0 supplements it will make a huge difference and\u00a0\nthen step three is your topical skin care and\u00a0\u00a0 you need to you know focus on everything that i\u00a0\njust talked about with the topical skincare and\u00a0\u00a0 the three of those steps combined i promise\u00a0\nyou you will see a difference with your skin\u00a0\u00a0 a hundred percent now again this is what worked\u00a0\nfor me it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 100 work the same for you i'm not a doctor this\u00a0\nis just my experience but i can promise you that\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea is not incurable it is not\u00a0\nsomething that you can't treat yourself\u00a0\u00a0 and it's something that you don't need to take\u00a0\nantibiotics for antibiotics actually ruin your gut\u00a0\u00a0 health and that's why so many times when you're on\u00a0\nan antibiotic for rosacea or for acne because they\u00a0\u00a0 throw those things at you like crazy when you go\u00a0\nto the doctor for those skin conditions you start\u00a0\u00a0 taking them and then you have to get off them and\u00a0\nyour acne comes back worse your rosacea comes back\u00a0\u00a0 worse because you actually just messed up\u00a0\nyour

Honey is also an antibacterial and moisturizes the skin well. Milk makes the skin brighter, velvety and supple. Apply evenly to clean skin, even under the eyes to reduce dark circles. Let it act for about 20 minutes, then rinse with cold water. If you have any mask left, keep it in the refrigerator for a few days, for the next use. This mask  reduces inflammation and redness, and helps the skin heal  At the same time, thanks to its antioxidant properties, it also contributes to skin rejuvenation. Thus, fine lines and wrinkles are reduced, giving the face a younger appearance. It is also effective for rosacea, a disease characterized by redness and pimples. Turmeric reduces redness and treats this disease.\nIt acts like a cream, exfoliates, reduces redness, gives the skin brightness and a fresh and clean look. You can redo this mask in a few days, every month, depending on the needs of the skin.  Thank you for watching!

        "published_at": "2023-09-05T11:00:35Z",
        "transcript": "hey what if I told you that rosacea is not a skin issue but rather just a symptom of a deeper problem within your body so if you wake up every morning dreading the thought of facing yet another day battling your rosacea and the sight of your inflamed skin despite all your efforts to control the flares makes you want to hide from the world and leaves you feeling utterly defeated then stick around because this video is just for you my friend it's time to stop treating rosacea like it's a skin issue and start addressing the underlying root causes of the problem today we're going to talk about how your rosacea symptoms are connected to your gut health and potentially to a situation called histamine intolerance I'm Tammy Anderson functional health expert and when it comes to the pain embarrassment and frustration of dealing with a stubborn skin issue I've been in your shoes for like 20 years and I know the pain and suffering all too well and I've had the privilege of working with numerous clients who came to me in that place of profound despair just wanting to hide themselves from the world much like how you might be feeling right now as well but the good news is just like myself and my clients who have healed their rosacea I want to assure you that there is hope that it is possible to put an end to the suffering from rosacea once and for all but like I said a minute ago you have to stop treating it like a skin issue and start addressing the root causes of the problem one of which is gut issues and very likely an underlying issue called histamine intolerance quick story many years ago when I saw a naturopathic doctor for the first time I was told that my skin troubles were rooted in a leaky gut but at the time this was a totally foreign concept to me and honestly she didn't do a very good job of explaining what having a leaky gut meant and for the life of me I simply couldn't wrap my head around how on Earth my gut could have anything to do with my problem skin now while this doctor really didn't do much for me in terms of offering the right guidance to heal my gut and I didn't really see any results in working with her it did open my eyes and my mind to the concept that my gut was somehow connected to at least my skin health and it wasn't until several years later actually when I started focusing on healing myself from the inside out and addressing my gut health when I was making a truly desperate attempt to get my life back because I was dealing with a life-threatening respiratory issue that's when I noticed that not only did my respiratory problem in the laundry list of other health issues that I had been dealing with all started to disappear at the same time and along with those issues my skin trouble started to disappear as well and and I had been dealing with awful skin for like 20 years at that point and that's when I had my big aha moment and it became clear to me that all of these symptoms which I had just attributed to bad luck or bad genetics were all intricately connected to an underlying problem and it wasn't until later that I actually discovered that histamine intolerance was at the root cause of this laundry list of symptoms that I had been struggling with and I also understood the crucial role of gut healing in reversing histamine intolerance and truly healing myself from the inside out so what I want you to understand is that your gut health is intimately linked to your overall well-being and that includes your skin your skin is the largest organ of your body and skin related symptoms are just your body telling you that something is wrong on the inside so think about this your gut is the one part of your body that is inside your body but is also exposed to the outside world it's like a long tube that stretches from your mouth including your nose all the way through your body through the exit at the other end so the lining of your gut acts as a protective barrier against external threats from the outside world like toxins pathogens inflammatory foods and other things however when this lining becomes compromised a condition called leaky gut occurs and what happens is the Once really tightly connected cells that line your gut loosen up and that allows toxins pathogens undigested food particles and other things to enter your bloodstream where they don't belong and this triggers a red alert from the immune system and that leads to widespread inflammation throughout the body and a host of chronic symptoms and other conditions can result from this so before I go further into how a damaged gut lining can lead to histamine and tolerance parents and your rosacea symptoms I want to invite you to grab access to the free histamine video training that I've created for you if you're ready to dive deeper into understanding and addressing the underlying causes of histamine intolerance and just truly transforming your skin and your life so the link for that is in the description below this video so make sure to go grab that alright so back to the gut when the gut is leaky and damaged another critical function of the gut is compromised and that is the production of an enzyme called diamine oxidase or Dao Dao is primarily produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine and its function is to break down and neutralize histamine preventing it from building up too much in the body and reducing the risk of histamine-related symptoms so when the gut lining becomes compromised it gets damaged and the Dao enzyme production or function becomes insufficient because of that gut lining damage histamine levels start to go up and up and up leading to a condition known as histamine intolerance now histamine plays many roles in the body a major one of which is immune responses and because of this we need the ability to get histamine anywhere in the body in an instant whenever there's a need for it has an immune response that's why we have histamine receptors on virtually every cell of the body and because of that histamine intolerance can manifest as a wide range of symptoms throughout the body and that includes your skin and yes that also includes rosacea so rosacea may be your most visible sign that you might be dealing with a histamine intolerance but there are other Telltale indicators that histamine intolerance could be an underlying issue for you so if you experience other unexplained symptoms in other parts of your body like headaches or migraines fatigue allergies or respiratory problems itching anxiety or panic attacks a rapid heartbeat fainting spells sleep issues urinary urgency food sensitivity digestive issues like bloating or diarrhea then these are some big clues that an underlying histamine intolerance is probably going on because there's usually a cluster of symptoms it's not just one thing and everybody by the way has kind of a different cluster of symptoms so no two people may have the exact same symptom profile when they have a histamine intolerance so like I said too much histamine built up in the body can create Havoc anywhere in the body so if you want to truly be free from the pain inflammation and embarrassment of rosacea once and for all and have clear skin and more confidence you need to shift your focus from the surface problem to the root causes and that starts with improving your gut health that is absolutely critical so if you're ready to start fixing your gut and want a strategic and effective no guessing no Rabbit Hole diving approach so that you can start feeling lighter and more confident in your skin I've created a gut repair tool kit for you and you can get started on that Journey right away you'll find a link to find more information and get started today in the description below this video so when it comes to your skin and your overall health it's critical to understand that it's never just one thing there's almost always a combination of factors involved that create What I Call The Perfect Storm and that's why it's so important to take a truly holistic approach when addressing the underlying issues and not just treat it as a skin issue so my self-guided program the histamine solution Academy guides you to implement a truly holistic approach to address the problem from the inside out it's structured around four important pillars that work together to allow you to get deep healing from within by addressing all the contributing factors so the pillars include nutritional support lifestyle and environment modifications

working on the root causes of rosacea rosacea symptoms are really just a powerful message from your body saying knock knock something's going on something needs your attention and by addressing histamine intolerance and your gut you're not only going to start that journey to clear radiant skin that you can feel more confident in but you'll also be improving your overall health and your your longevity and your quality of life moving forward all right if you haven't already watched my video titled why a low histamine diet is not the solution I highly recommend checking that out next it's

        "transcript": "hey everyone and welcome back to my channel I am finally filming this rosacea video for you guys so I am just gonna be talking about some of the causes of rosacea and some supplements and things you can do and some lifestyle changes you can make to help get rid of the rosacea before I get started if you are new to my channel thank you so much for stopping by my name is Marla and I am a registered holistic nutritionist and I definitely have had my fair share of skin issues in the past and was able to reverse them all and improve my skin dramatically through nutrition so I hope that some of these tips will help you just make sure you do contact or consult a doctor or practitioner before incorporating any of these tips so we're gonna just get started the cause of rosacea is not yet known um and a lot of the causes of it are not going to be covered in this video there are so many things that can trigger it like heat or cold I'm so many issues and things so I'm not going to touch on all of them this video is not going to be an all-inclusive or completely in-depth there's lots of research you can still do on this topic on your own but a couple of the main causes of rosacea number one one of the big ones is low stomach acid there are many things that can cause low stomach acid I don't want this video to be long so I'm not going to go into all of them but some of them being stress and said antibiotics excessive coffee consumption lots of junk food eating meals very large meals at one time I'm not chewing your food properly low thyroid so there's a lot of factors that can contribute to a low stomach acid levels but when you do have low stomach acid levels that's a big trigger for eczema and rosacea and acne so something you can do I'll kind of get into some supplements you can take but by boosting your stomach acid levels it usually helps to lower the inflammation of the skin which is what rosacea is because you're gonna be digesting your food a lot better which will help to lower inflammation in the body so definitely low stomach acid is it's a common trigger Candida or dis overgrowth or dysbiosis in general is also another trigger for rosacea but also acne and eczema as well kind of all together usually when you improve your dysbiosis and improve your digestive function usually people start to notice a lot of improvement in terms of their rosacea kind of connected to that would be liver toxicity as well that's always the underlying cause of so many things it when you have liver toxicity toxins are not able to leave the body and they kind of recirculate and they either exit through the skin causing the eczema acne or they bounce around the body causing inflammation which is kind of what I'm rosacea is it's inflammation of the skin so by opening up our elimination pathways and allowing toxins to drain effectively and efficiently will help to reduce the acidity of our body reduce the toxicity and inflammation in our body and improve our rosacea so there's a lot of factors as you can see and there's stuff of something you can do about it I'm the first thing before you even start any protocols or anything like that I do always recommend taking care of your skin so first of all if it's extremely cold out if you live in Canada and it starts to get really cold like where I live then consider putting like a scarf around your face on your outside so just protect yourself if you're in extreme heat don't get too much sun damage don't let your face get burnt by the Sun that's all gonna aggravate it some more so just be careful there kids in the background I'm sorry I do have I'm looking down I do have my notes here to keep me on on track so there's a few foods that are can be very common aggravators or triggers for rosacea but also eczema acne they're gonna be your gluten dairy corn and soy and then also um foods that are either high oxalate or high histamine so oranges chocolate caffeine yeast is huge people we usually find that just by getting off of yeast so fermented foods bread things like that that their their skin starts to clear so you can consider doing that definitely like your nightshades are huge for skin problems so you're at plant potato tomato pepper you can just Google food aggravators for rosacea on Google and I'm sure there'll be a list you can you can find but definitely avoiding the main common triggers which are gonna be your nightshades or gluten your dairy corn soy cane sugar and caffeine are gonna go a long way to helping reduce your rosacea things you want to eat are gonna be whole grains quality protein lots of healthy fats loads of green vegetables fruit so there's plenty you can eat but just try to limit your processed and refined foods which will also trigger the and contribute to candida overgrowth which will make the rosacea worse obviously your alcohol and your caffeine should be avoided as well so there's a lot of things you can do something you want to make sure you're doing as well when you have rosacea or any skin issues it's usually related to too much acidity in the body so we do want to alkalize so you can do lots of like greens in your diet lots of alkaline forming foods are gonna go a long way to helping improve your skin apple cider vinegar is fantastic it's one of the won one of the only foods that had that contains contains yeast sorry that I recommend when you have skin conditions because it helps to balance the pH of our intestines I'm really our whole body but it also contains the probiotics and B vitamins and very anti-inflammatory so something you can consider including in your diet I usually do a shot of apple cider vinegar either in the morning on an empty stomach or after dinner to help digest some foods so there's so many ways you can incorporate it and you can mix it with stevia some lemon juice things like that if you want to make it taste a little better so in terms of that kind of covers diet I don't want to go super super in-depth but I might do an article on my website I do have a website it's WWE holistic spring calm and I do share articles and health tips on there under the learn tab so you can definitely head over there I will hopefully post an article on it in the next in the near future the next couple of weeks kind of going in more in depth so you want to make sure you're drinking plenty of water we do not want our skin to be hot and dehydrated when you have any type of skin condition we really go to reduce inflammation and one of the ways is flushing out toxins and water is great for doing that so increase your water consumption really Alcala alkalinize the diet avoid pro-inflammatory inflammatory foods so your sugar your peanuts canola oil processed and refined foods these are very inflammatory you want anti inflammatory so wild-caught fish cod liver oil bone broths whole grains fruits and vegetables have parts flax and chia seeds the list goes on so there's a lot so you can definitely do for your for your diet to reduce inflammation in the body including herbs is a fantastic way to do that if you ever make a soup or rice or something throw in some ginger turmeric or dried basil dried oregano thyme fantastic herbs to reduce inflammation and make your food taste better too so in terms of supplements what can we do the first thing I say before you evers try to do a candida cleanse which I do recommend for rosacea but before trying to do a candida cleanse I always say begin with a liver cleanse you can do gentle liver cleanses which are going to be more like juices hot lemon water liquid chlorophyll like a celery cucumber juice things like that which is very gentle it doesn't do a deep cleanse so I always recommend contacting a practitioner to get really into a deep liver drainer but initially on your own those are some things you can do there are I did a whole liver video I'm - liver videos actually on my channel so you can check those out if you want a little bit more info but flushing the liver aloe vera gel is great for that um there are supplements you can take to help support your liver as well so kind of give your liver some support so it could start to detox effectively and efficiently before considering a candida cleanse so maybe do that for about a month on some liver drainage just to get your body prepped once you have done that move on to a candida cleanse and you can do some antifungals so I like doing some like black walnut caprylic acid some clove wormwood grapes grapefruit seed extract there's so many different supplements you can take there's ones that are all-inclusive and have everything in one supplement so you can do your own research if you do want a consultation to help clear your acne rosacea eczema anything like that you can definitely contact me and I would be happy to work with you but once you work on a candida cleanse you'll notice that your skin will start to improve so definitely consider a candida cleanse but some supplements you can start right now before doing anything to really help your skin the first thing is going to be probiotics you guys need to offer the probiotics you want to go for human strains here you're going to want to take anywhere from 50 billion to like a hundred billion the more better and you can start off slow and slowly increase your dose if you're not used to taking probiotics but definitely start and start you know maybe around the 10 billion mark work your way up but definitely try to hit 100 billion 150 billion we really need to flood our system with probiotics here to help reduce inflammation and digest our food the next thing you want to take is going to be hydrochloric acid obviously as long as you don't have ulcers and an under act and an overactive stomach you can take the supplement so take it with caution consult a practitioner before using but hydrochloric acid is going to help to boost your stomach acidity which I mentioned in the beginning is one of the main causes for rosacea so people with rosacea usually have an underactive or under functioning stomach so by taking betaine hydrochloric acid I like the natural factors brand or I think there's so many brands out there you can take I think now Foods has one as well so by taking that usually anywhere from 15 to 1500 to 1700 milligrams after meal after every meal is gonna really help to digest the proteins in that meal and reduce the inflammation so incorporate hydrochloric acid you want to your probiotics the next thing is going to be pancreatic enzymes guys this is huge so I kind of mentioned that when you have skin conditions especially metabolic skin conditions that usually you have liver problems liver toxicity and you need to drain when you have liver toxicity it always means that your liver is not producing enough enzymes as well its overburdened it's not functioning optimally you're not producing enough pancreatic enzymes to digest your fats and your carbs which means your skin is gonna suffer usually the cod liver oil and the healthy avocados and things we eat and chia seeds and flax seeds are what's gonna nourish our skin but when we're not absorbing them because we're not producing enough enzymes to break them down we are gonna be deficient so upping our pancreatic enzymes is gonna go a long way to reducing inflammation it's gonna make sure you're absorbing the cod liver oil and the omega-3s and everything you're eating but it's also gonna make sure it's reducing inflammation in the body because food is being fully digested another thing you can go a step further with the pancreatic enzymes and consider incorporating bile salts or ox bile and something that is going to just really again emulsify the fats so when you consume a fatty food usually your liver will secure your gallbladder will secrete the store at a file to help emulsify the food but you don't have enough bile if your liver is toxic and not functioning so the bile will not be able to be emulsified and stored and utilized by the liver so kind of we'll just go through you without you actually absorbing the nutrients and benefits from it so including some pancreatic enzymes will have bile in it I absolutely love janessa pancreatin I will leave a link in the description for these but Genest your pancreas and supplement is amazing because it does have the ox bile and all that in it along with the pancreatic enzyme so it's kind of like an all-in-one something else is gonna be your essential fats so your cod liver oil krill oil there are vegan omega-3 oils like aji flower oil so you can definitely go whichever route you want but definitely consider getting a good quality omega-3 supplement alongside a good anti-inflammatory diet with some wild caught fish and salmon and things like that and make sure you do take your your healthy omega-3 supplements with a digestive enzyme to absorb it so the next thing you're gonna want to do BIOS vitamin C with bioflavonoids this is huge guys I like the company already see Arjun estra or DC it's a vitamin C with green tea extracts and written lots of bioflavonoids and antihistamines to significantly reduce inflammation to make sure your body's absorbing the vitamin C it's an amazing supplement I recommend anywhere from 4,000 milligrams to 15,000 milligrams a day this is one you're gonna have to take to tolerance so some people can only tolerate maybe 5,000 milligrams before they have to go to the washroom some people may be contol err 850 thousand before having to go to the washroom so you have to start slow start at one capsule and increase it until you feel like you have to go to the washroom once you hit that dose again you know what you were at you can decrease it by one capsule the next time you take it so I hope that makes sense you can google how to do vitamin C 2 tolerance and that might go into a little bit more depth and explain but definitely vitamin C with bioflavonoids is going to reduce inflammation it's gonna completely nourish your skin provide your body with potent to help combat the toxins that are floating around the body so super critical there something else you want to make sure you're doing is vitamin E and vitamin A so you'll notice that we're kind of talking a lot about fat soluble vitamins here when our liver is not functioning properly it's not emulsifying absorbing and storing our fat soluble vitamins our vitamin A e DK and b12 gets stored in our liver until our body needs to use it and then our liver will release it so if I'll ever stop functioning it's not storing it's not utilizing it's not emulsifying these vitamins so you can have a perfect diet and even take a lot of supplements but if you're not absorbing it you're not getting the benefits so taking all these with your digestive enzymes is gonna be so crucial to ensuring that you're nourishing your body and you're actually getting the benefits from all these supplements so once you have our taking these supplements this is just kind of like the general baseline I recommend a liquid chlorophyll as well to help alkalize once you're kind of in the habit of taking these you can consider moving on to the liver drainage then the candida cleanse you'll start to notice improvements as you go through each phase again if you do want consult you can contact me I'd be so happy to work with you but in terms of other lifestyle tips you can do this videos super quick so I don't want you guys to be watching like a hour-long video through so much I can go into here but I'm just staying very minimal the first thing is of course treat your dysbiosis stop eating refined foods cut out sugar you got to start knocking back the Candida in order to start improving your skin so treat your dispossess treat the parasites as part of that you're gonna want to improve your desk digestive enzyme production by supplementing but also by your hot lemon water by intermittent fasting maybe eating smaller meals chewing your food while all of these come together to give your digestive system a rest and a break to regenerate and to start functioning properly on its own so you don't have to do enzymes lifelong I'm so definitely working on improving your digestion is gonna go a long way to getting rid of the rosacea for good you obviously want to get good quality sleep exercise you know these are all gonna help your immune system and help with lymphatic drainage and things like that so those are kind of like a no-brainer there I think reducing stress is going to be huge a lot of people find when there's is when their rosacea flares up sometimes even with acne and eczema so you want to be careful and try to keep your stress levels down something I always recommend is set an alarm on your phone for every hour or every two hours or even every three hours to take three deep breaths as soon as the alarm goes off stop what you're doing even if you're mid convo and three deep breaths this is going to just constantly remind your body to kind of kick your parasympathetic nervous system back in to relax so your cortisol levels aren't spiking sorry cortisol means more inflammation so keep your stress levels down something else you can do that's great is castor oil pack so these are gonna help with detoxification I have used these in the past they work really well you can either buy them online or make them yourself I'm not gonna go into too much detail here this is something I want you guys to go and research on your own and look into on your own and see if you know something you want to give a try and if you want to there's so many steps and how to's online I just don't have time to go into in depth here in this video but castor oil packs are definitely great for detoxing and you know getting reducing inflammation and all that um you definitely want to like I said focus on cleansing your whole system so you're not only your liver in your kidneys but your colon you need to do liquid chlorophyll lots of fiber aloe vera gel bentonite clay or activated charcoal all of these supplements are going to help too and don't take them all at once even but these supplements are all things you can take and do to kind of completely flush out the colon the more toxins we get out of our body it means the less toxins are going to escape through our skin so we want to pull all these out through a urine in our stool so cleansing the colon is huge cleansing your lymphatic system is so important here there are a few ways to go about it so I'm not going to go in-depth here this is where I recommend a consultation because you can go to homeopathic route or the herbal route and it really the route you choose depends on you and your severity of your symptoms and toxicity but if you want a basic lymphatic drainage you can just google basic lymphatic lymphatic drainage protocol to find some supplements echinacea works the only thing is if you have an autoimmune condition do not take echinacea because if boosts your immune system it can cause a lot of autoimmune issue so be careful there consult a practitioner if you're not sure and then cleansing the skin so this is also where homeopathics are gonna come in and herbal remedies um there are supplements you can take and drain it drainage protocols you can follow that drain not only your liver but your skin and your lymphatic system altogether to completely send toxins out through your urine in your stool rather than letting them cleanse out through the skin so there's so many things you can use here there's tissue salts there's a Lego therapy there's fighter genes there's gem oh so again I can't really say specifically what to do in this video for those supplements because everyone's different and requires a different supplement especially when it comes to homeopathics but um for sure liquid chlorophyll all of these are great cleansers I highly recommend incorporating these activated charcoal to kind of mop and soak up toxins lots of great stuff you can do so this is just a very general video like I said if you want you know more one-on-one help you can contact me but hopefully this gives you an idea of what you need to do you need to boost your stomach acid improve your enzyme function which is going to help your digestion you need to cleanse your liver your kidneys your colon cleanse your get rid of Candida and the parasites as you do all this you'll start to notice your skin will drastically improve I mean if you kind of maintain and continue to live healthy after that you should not have a return of your symptoms manage your stress levels get frequent exercise good quality sleep and you'll be well on your way to improving your skin and your health so I hope these tips helped if you have any more questions leave them in the comments for me down below make sure you're following me on Instagram it's at Marla's healthy life where I give you day-to-day tips just like this I share my favorite supplements healthy recipes and all the rest of it so thank you so much for

        "transcript": "It\u2019s very normal for us to get red-faced\nwhenever we practice physical exercise or are feeling ashamed due to some embarrassing\nsituation. However, when this reddish color insists on\nremaining it maybe due to another factor. These red areas are often mistaken for sunburns,\nand may be caused by a skin disease called rosacea. Rosacea usually manifests itself in the central\narea of your face, cheeks, nose, forehead and chin and we still don\u2019t know much about\nits causes. If you find that your face is constantly red,\nthere are some natural remedies you can try: Oats\nOats have both anti-inflammatory properties and soothing compounds, making them ideal\nfor relieving itching and reducing redness. You can make an oat paste by mixing a few\ntablespoons of oatmeal with a little water and applying it directly to the desired area. Let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes and then rinse\nit off. Chamomile\nChamomile is great for your skin because it affects your skin in the same way that oats\ndo. You can use either diluted chamomile essential\noil or chamomile tea and apply it directly to your skin. It is recommended that you repeat this process\na few times throughout the day in order to obtain the best results. Aloe Vera\nThis plant can both regenerate, heal, and nourish your skin. To use it, the best thing to do is slice an\naloe vera leaf open and scoop the inside gel out. Store the aloe gel in a sealed container,\nand use it on any red skin patches. Honey\nHoney is a powerful moisturizer, and can be very beneficial for those who suffer from\nrosacea. Certain types of honey, such as kanuka and\nmanuka are the best at treating this ailment. You can apply the honey directly to the affected\narea and let it sit for a few minutes. Licorice\nOne study has shown that licorice is able to reduce skin redness, one of the most common\nsymptoms of rosacea. Mix one tablespoon of licorice extract with\none teaspoon of honey and one teaspoon of aloe vera gel. Apply this mixture to the your skin. Leave it on for 15 minutes and then rinse\nit off with warm water. Repeat this process twice a day. There are some other factors that can aggravate\nthe rosacea symptoms, such as excessive sun exposure, and certain types of food (such\nas spicy foods.) Some people also say that foods like chocolate\nworsen your rosacea, so try to pay attention to how your body reacts to different foods.",

categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there lastly\u00a0\nbefore i go i want to say please be kind to others\u00a0\u00a0 be considerate to people who are suffering from\u00a0\nskin condition before you ask someone about their\u00a0\u00a0 face please think how you would feel if you were\u00a0\nin their shoes i feel like social media is also\u00a0\u00a0 to blame so we are conditioned to think everybody\u00a0\nneeds to have a beautiful skin you always see\u00a0\u00a0 like edited pictures flawless skin clear skin\u00a0\nin real life we have pores we have breakouts\u00a0\u00a0 we have pigmentation nobody has that porcelain\u00a0\nskin or baby like skin still today even though\u00a0\u00a0 i have a clear skin i don't have like a perfect\u00a0\nskin i feel like it is so important to normalize\u00a0\u00a0 skin conditions we need to have open dialogue\u00a0\nand open conversation in social media that is\u00a0\u00a0 how i feel anybody suffering with skin\u00a0\ncondition acne pigmentation or any sort\u00a0\u00a0 of skin condition please be kind to yourself\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching this video once\u00a0\u00a0 again and i hope you found this video helpful\u00a0\nand i'll see you guys on my next video if you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't subscribed please do i love to have\u00a0\nyou on my channel till then take care bye guys",

there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",
