        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "so many of you have been requesting videos on rosacea especially since i talked about it being a skin condition that i personally struggle with so i thought a good place to start is to tell you a little bit about what rosacea is and some do's and don'ts to follow if you have rosacea i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and find skincare products that work for you first of all what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic but treatable skin condition that typically involves the face now i say treatable and not curable because sometimes patients will come see me in my office expect to get a treatment regimen for three to four months for their rosacea and then never deal with it again and the reality is that rosacea is a lifelong condition and there will be times when it's flaring and there will be times when it's under really good control but the goals of rosacea management aren't to get rid of it because there's no cure but to manage it in a way where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life and where you're happy with your skin it's a persistent inflammatory skin condition meaning that it often presents with redness and irritation and i'll talk a little bit more about the signs and symptoms of rosacea in a minute but it also affects men and women the women slightly more than men and it is really a disease of adults so the onset of rosacea is usually after the age of 30. more than 16 million americans have rosacea that's about 1 in 20 people and we think that globally about 5.5 percent of the world's population also has rosacea rosacea symptoms can include easily flushing or blushing persistent facial redness visible vessels on the skin surface easily irritated skin scaly skin dry skin itchy skin it also can affect the eyes so some people will get grittiness or irritation in their eyes and the last thing is that rosacea can have pimples and so it is often misdiagnosed as acne someone with rosacea might just have one or two of those symptoms and someone might have all of the things i just listed so it really can exist on a spectrum of severity but also the presentation can vary widely from person to person one question i get all the time is why do i have rosacea what is causing it is it something that i am doing and oftentimes it's not it we know that rosacea is caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors but a lot of times people don't have full control over those and so it's not about what's causing your rosacea at that point it's more about you have rosacea what are we going to do about it and it's great that we have awesome treatments to help get rosacea under control for people and manage those signs and symptoms so they're not suffering from their skin condition on a day-to-day basis prior to just a few years ago we used to categorize people with rosacea based on kind of the main signs or symptoms that they were presenting with i'm gonna go over those four categorizations even though we don't really use those clinically anymore because i do think it helps people understand the signs and symptoms that rosacea can present with but just know we don't use those categorizations anymore because we understand that people with rosacea can kind of have overlapping symptoms that span more than one category the first of sort of these four categories of rosacea is something called erythematolangictatic rosacea and really what this means is rosacea presenting with facial redness and typically this is redness in the center of the face so the chin the cheeks the nose and the forehead and this is redness that is often present at baseline but then gets worse with flushing or blushing based on exposure to certain triggers and then with that flushing or blushing you can also have altered sensations of the skin like sensitivity stinging burning or sort of this overwhelming heat sensation the other thing that can happen with this erythematologic rosacea is the presence of telangiectasias which are dilated blood vessels that are visible on the skin surface the second prior subtype of rosacea was something called papulopustular rosacea and really this was rosacea presenting with red bumps or red pustules which are red bumps filled with pus this is the type of rosacea or a feature of rosacea that is most commonly mistaken or mistreated as acne so it's something that's important for your doctor to be able to recognize the third prior categorization of rosacea was something called thymidus rosacea also called rhinophyma when it specifically involved the nose but really this is the development of sort of a thick bumpy texture to the skin and it's not a common feature of rosacea but it's certainly something to keep an eye out for the fourth category of rosacea was ocular rosacea or rosacea involving the eye this will often present as irritation light sensitivity watering eyes a gritty sensation in the eye but like i said before we are not using these four categorizations anymore we know that people can have redness and eye symptoms or feminist features and papules and pustules so it's more about what each unique person is presenting with when we're diagnosing and treating their rosacea so let's get into the do's and don'ts of rosacea i just want to put a caveat here though that these are guidelines they are not strict rules i know i'm a physician i'm a board certified dermatologist and i'm telling you these things about rosacea but just know that everyone's skin is different and if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is fine it's no big deal but these might be things that are worth thinking about if your rosacea is not under optimal control and you're trying to figure out ways for you to intervene and make a meaningful positive difference see a dermatologist we are able to accurately diagnose and give you a treatment plan for your rosacea i cannot tell you how many times i've seen rosacea misdiagnosed as acne lupus an allergic reaction eczema seborrheic dermatitis if your face is red or bumpy or sensitive and you don't know why get the help of an expert to make sure you're treating the right thing get to know your rosacea triggers and then avoid those triggers so although we don't know all of the causes of rosacea we do know certain environmental factors make rosacea worse and they can really vary from person to person so things like sun exposure hot or cold weather stress alcohol chocolate dairy spicy foods i mean the list goes on and it really is unique to each person what i recommend is that if you're not sure what your triggers are keep a rosacea diary any time your rosacea is flaring write down what you ate what you drink and what your surrounding environment is like being more aware of your triggers and avoiding them will absolutely help your rosacea stay under better control protect your skin from the sun so wide brim hats please and then sunscreen every single day now i used to tell my rosacea patients to use mineral-based sunscreens only so those with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as the uv filters because we thought they were maybe a little bit less irritating but what i found over time is that a lot of my rosacea patients can tolerate chemical uv filters in their sunscreen just fine so rather than limiting my patients sunscreen options i let them know that it might be a little bit of trial and error to find a sunscreen that they love but once they do use it every day keep your skin well moisturized people with rosacea often will have some skin barrier disruption and be more prone to barrier disruption even if they're using gentle skin care so using a nice moisturizer that feels good on your skin that doesn't cause stinging every single day and maybe sometimes twice a day if you're feeling particularly dry will help your skin feel better and look better too and my final do is have realistic expectations of what's achievable when treating rosacea typically the goals should be to have fewer flares and have your symptoms be well managed but if your goal is to have zero evidence that you've ever had rosacea you're really likely to be disappointed and i'm not saying that to be debbie downer dermatologist over here but if you focus on incremental improvement you're much more likely to find success in your treatment and be happier for it let's get into the don'ts i feel like i have to say this one more time before i get into the don'ts which is if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is totally fine that's okay keep doing it these are not rosacea laws these are just recommendations don't overheat your skin or expose it to extreme temperatures now this can be tricky to do all of the time but we do know that really cold weather and wind as well as really hot weather and indoor heating can all flare rosacea don't rub or scrub the face so any type of physical manipulation or physical exfoliation can cause increased redness and irritation so that goes for physical exfoliants like microbeads or scrubs as well as even like the rough fibers of a towel rubbed on the face they can all cause increased irritation so pat your face dry don't aggressively massage it just be nice to your skin don't use too many products a simple skincare regimen really is best especially if you're incorporating prescription topical medications to treat your rosacea you really don't want to be layering product after product after product you also might be sensitive to certain products so doing a little patch test in front of your ear or on your jawline for several days before kind of using it all over your entire face is not a bad idea don't use certain skin care ingredients that are known to trigger rosacea not every person with rosacea is going to be sensitive to the same types of skincare ingredients but in a survey conducted by the national rosacea society there were some ingredients that more people tended to be sensitive to and those are things like alcohol witch hazel fragrance menthol peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil there are other types of skin care ingredients like tretinoin and retinoids salicylic acid glycolic acid benzoyl peroxide antioxidants and topical vitamin c and people want to know i have rosacea those things can be irritating can i use them and really it's on a case-by-case basis one thing i recommend is never introducing more than one active to your regimen at once so if you're thinking okay i want to introduce a retinoid go low and slow and kind of see how it works out for you i use tretinoin in my routine even though i have rosacea but i could not do that initially i had to get my rosacea under really good control before i could incorporate that ingredient i never want to say anything is truly off limits for my rosacea patients but just know that you have to use things like acids or exfoliators with caution and understand that even if you can't tolerate them at this point in your rosacea journey you might be able to in the future don't be afraid to use prescription medication i find that sometimes in clinic i meet resistance from patients who just want to use over-the-counter options but this is a true skin disease and i don't find that most of my patients want over-the-counter options for their other types of diseases that they have skin disease should be no different don't be afraid of the prescriptions they are really developed for the treatment of rosacea they have been well studied give them a shot and my final don't is if you have rosacea and you have not been able to get it under control don't feel hopeless okay team up with a dermatologist maybe get a second opinion and also understand that rosacea is constantly being researched we are learning more about this condition day by day and as we move forward we are going to have even better treatments and interventions to offer what tips have helped you with your rosacea put them in the comments below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "description": "Hi loves. ugh this video was a tough one. I wanted you guys to see what happened when I had a major Rosacea flare up recently.",
        "published_at": "2023-05-23T20:46:57Z",
        "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so I have decided to officially dedicate a part of my channel to rosacea since now miss rosacea has officially become a major part of my life involuntarily um which I'm not happy about what what can you do um so I thought that I would just come on here and share with you guys stuff I've been doing to kind of alleviate or help with my rose shot that attacks here and there more frequently than I would like but as you guys know I have been getting laser treatments uh BBL and stuff like that to get not get rid of it because you can't really get rid of it it's something that doesn't actually have a cure but to help calm it down however that does not help the texture that comes with uh rosacea unfortunately so those lasers are only good for getting rid of the redness but that's about it so with rosacea comes these small bumps that look like acne and lots of texture which is really tough to deal with because when you put makeup on to I don't know diffuse it it actually makes it worse because you're putting makeup on bumps that are going to actually rise up more and they're actually going to be more noticeable which really sucks so the only way to deal with it is to actually try to get rid of it recently I had a flare out so bad unlike actually I've had this kind of flare out one other time but this one was really really really bad to the point that I actually ended up locking myself in my apartment I did not go anywhere I canceled every plan I didn't even even when I wanted to go get groceries covet's been over for a really long time and I had to look for a mask so that I'd pretend like I'm still worried about covet put on my sunglasses I look like a crazy person I was even considering putting fake bangs just so nobody recognizes me but I really really had a tough time with it um it really affects your self-confidence and um yeah it's really really difficult if you have anything skin related you you only then realize how important and what a significant role beautiful skin actually has on your daily life the point that now I think oh if I have clear skin all I need is just moisturizer and I feel so confident going out which before when I didn't have rosacea I would feel like I have to pack on all this makeup so that my skin looks even better but now I have a different level of appreciation for um the smooth skin that I do have so after that flare out that happened where I ended up locking myself into the house the only other place other than the grocery store that I went to was um to the walk-in clinic because I was like I cannot I cannot deal with this I had a major major meltdown um but I went to the walk-in clinic and the doctor prescribed me this gold tube it's called Roosevelt I think that's how you say it I'm sorry if I'm butchering the name but this is what it looks like and let me tell you this has been my Saving Grace um I've been applying it you're supposed to apply it once a day um I think until the two finishes um and you might have to just keep rebuying it however um you apply it once you don't want to overdo it because you actually might have a different kind of flare out that happens because this is a strong cream so you really need to actually make sure that you're not applying it more than the um directions actually say but within even one day I felt like it really um calmed my skin but still obviously I had all these acne acne you know spots and they were all over my forehead all over my temples and then all over my cheeks if I one day have the guts to um show you guys the pictures which I'm gonna hope that by the time I'm uploading this video I have the guts to put a picture somewhere over here but you would be shocked at what a difference it made and obviously today there's no filters on this camera um I wanted to show you guys the purest form of my skin the only thing I do have on my skin is a tinted moisturizer or tinted SPF but that's about it as you guys can see the texture is pretty much gone all the acne is pretty much gone and this is my skin pretty much almost raw almost raw um I promise you you're not going to be disappointed um it is something that you have to get prescribed it's not an over counter cream and the only other downside with it there's first of all no side effects the gentleman said that the gentleman the doctor said there's no side effects it's not going to harm your skin in any shape or form if anything it's going to actually better um the quality of your skin the only downside is a price I believe I paid 265 for it if I'm not mistaking um so yeah I mean for a small tube like this it is pretty pricey but there is no price on beautiful skin and the confidence that you regain after fixing your skin is honestly like this this is worth a million bucks to me so um yeah I just wanted to quickly share that with you guys I will definitely be sharing a lot more um information about my rosacea Journey because it's a never-ending one there's no cure for it and I feel for anybody that is going through it because it is really really really really frustrating because it's not just um to do with creams it's what you ingest activities that you do that bring the flare outs out so I'll be I'll be sharing all the information that I gather throughout my journey but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed watching this informative video um if you guys did please hit that like button and subscribe to my channel until next time",

        "transcript": "the fourth disastrous effect of sugar on your skin it worsens your rosacea there is a compound that in people with rosacea they're very high insulin resistance now insulin is important to bind to the glucose so that your body can then process the glucose in your blood whether with a high insulin resistance it means that the sugar is unable to be used by your blood as energy and then there's accumulation of glucose in your blood when rosacea they have high insulin resistance which makes for high sugar levels in their blood leading to a flare-up of rosacea so to those suffering from rosacea you need to reduce the amount of sugar that you're taking every day",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry a family physician and in this short video let's talk about the rosacea diet and how to reverse the redness associated with rosacea the redness the scaling the blood vessels are embarrassing over 400 million people on the planet suffer from rosacea and I have a secret to tell you later in this video that you might not believe what if I told you that the cause of your rosacea is not some of the triggers you've been told about but it's actually your diet it's what you've been eating and it's what you've not been eating that's what's causing your rosacea that's what this video is all about now if you know someone suffering from rosacea please take a second and share this video with them so that they will know there is hope and there is a solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at the end of this video watch that playlist and learn how to do Kido right Kido is cheap Kido is easy Kido is very safe very natural it's very nutritious and it's very delicious and it's going to help your rosacea get better than you ever dreamed it would be and then you can save your money that you've been wasting on co-pays with the pills and the gels and the creams and the lotions because you won't need those anymore now everyone who's already reversed their rosacea with a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet I need you to do me a favor in the comments below I need you to tell your story because there'll be people watching this video who will absolutely think I'm kooky and won't believe what I'm saying if you're a newbie to this if you're like there's no way you can reverse my rosacea

        "transcript": "have you ever faced skin condition like this does your face get hot and red often does it feel flat if you exposed to cold does it sometimes get all red even if you don't apply anything if the answer is yes then you might have rosacea so if you have rosacea or you've been facing problems because of your often flush skin this video is for you hello this is SAR Diva I love science skincare and science of skincare and today's quiz is to learn about what frisia is what causes it and how to control it first of all what is rosacea it's a chronic inflammatory skin condition the common symptoms of this condition is hot flush cheeks red inflammed skin bumpiness texture dileted blood vessels like this this fatness usually appears on the face and rarely on the other parts of the body if you have racea you might feel like your face is getting hot and a red flush appearing pretty often you may also sense a burning sensation whenever you try to apply any product or even when you're not applying anything at all you might see dileted blood vessels or it may appear like this some people may even notice swelling of face along with the redness for some people the redness may appear on the whole face and for some people it may appear only on the cheeks causes of fratia the exact cause or mechanism of fraa is yet to be fully understood however there are some common factors that contribute to the redness of the skin if you have racea your skin may act very sensitive and react very easily to various environmental factors or changes in the weather which should not be a problem for other people your body may have hyper responsive immune or inflammatory response which may trigger the flushness or redness of the skin now the very common trigger all the people suffering from racea must be aware of is sun exposure or sun damage U exposure is harmful for the skin of any color age race or G gender if you have racea in addition to the sunburn sun damage sun tan barrier damage you might also notice intense redness and Burning Sensations on the face change of weather May trigger visia for some people for example when I moved to the United Kingdom I started having these red flashes on my cheeks whenever I went outside in the cold weather drinking smoking regular lifestyle May worsen your racea condition and of course the products you apply on your face is very important too if you using any harsh products like s types apricot scrub or any ingredients that's irritating your skin then it can trigger youra for example some people have reported that using froid worsens their condition of racea so they had to choose two milder forms of froids like rol or Ral now a lot of people may experience a little flushness on their skin when they're embarrassed however if you have racea this flushness may appear more intense than that of other people stress is another important factor that plays a vital role in the appearance of racea so if you're under a lot of stress you may notice redness swelling or intense sensitivity of your skin tips to manage racea before I share the tips I want to remind you that tacea is a medical condition and unfortunately what works as a trigger for one person might not actually as a trigger for another there's no permanent cure for racea nor any special treatment to completely get rid of it it's always bested to do dermatologist to receive guidelines on how to manage your rosacea there are number of professional treatment options Foria for example lasers to manage the dilated blood vessels antibiotics to counter the inflammation prescription ex strength medication Etc however in case for some reason you're unable to see a dermatologist right now I'm going to share with you today some over the counter options like skincare and some precautionary tips that will help you with your racea to some extent tip number one the best strategy is to take notes every time your resia condition vers try to notice which factors might be contributing to you did you drink the day before have you introduced a new active product in your routine recently did you get a sunburn have you been under a lot of stress make a list of possible triggers and check them out one by one then once you have identified the potential triggers avoid them consciously for a considerable period of time and notice if your rati is getting better te number two if your ASA flares up after exercise or workout try to do your workout in a cooler environment or in a place with enough air flowing keep a fan nearby or a cold cloth to press your face from time to time keeping a cold towel on your neck may also help with lowering the temperature of your face and thereby minimize the flushing drinking cold liquid may also help with lowering the overall body temperature and minimize flushing tip number three Asic acid products can be help ful for managing racea now as I said before rosacea is a medical condition so the overthe counter asle a it products won't be as effective as the prescription ons still it can be helpful to incorporate it into your routine some Asic acid skincare products are Costa 10% ASC acid serum cholestero 10% Asic acid booster face washes containing sufa may also be helpful as they are anti-inflammatory for example K somar will eradicate daily forming cleanser tip number four be very very careful of using physical or mechanical products on your skin as I mentioned before physical scrubbing or at home Derma planning or anything aggressive even a lowquality cotton pad may also cause irritation to your skin and flare up racea tip number five be very mindful about sun exposure do apply sunscreen however it might be struggle to find a sunscreen that suits your skin as people with r tend to have sensitive skin so you might have to try out a few after you found a sunscreen that your skin can tolerate do apply it rigorously also take physical Sun prediction like wearing wi briam hats sunglasses umbrellas do you want Sun product recommendations that I find helpful for sensitive skin let me know in the comment section below if you find this video helpful please give it a like

actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big overview of rosacea what it is all the different types Medical Treatments that I recommend and then also a full AM and PM skincare routine please let me know if you have any questions let me know what

        "transcript": "well hey guys how do you tell the difference between acne and rosacea in today's video I'm going to explain to you exactly how to do that now if you're dealing with redness and painful pimples breakouts you might think you have acne but you could actually have rosacea they look very similar as I've said before not everything that looks like acne is acne and rosacea is pretty darn common and the reason it's so important to tell the difference and know what you're dealing with is because the approach to treating each condition is very different and in order to get good control of either condition you've got to know what it is you are dealing with when it comes to acne the signature skin lesion the spot that is very characteristic of acne is called a Comey Dome basically a plugged up pore now that comidone can have a black spot in it or it can present as a white bump these are commonly referred to as blackheads and whiteheads but the medical term for them is open and closed comedones but with acne you can also have Painful nodules and cysts and you can have red bombs that fill with pus as referred to as pustules in contrast with rosacea you can have red spots you can have pustules but there are no comedones no blackheads no white heads people with rosacea they can have very prominent pores but the pores are not clogged poor clogging is not a part of rosacea both acne and rosacea present with facial redness but where the redness is located is different in each condition with acne the redness tends to be confined around the breakouts whereas with rosacea the redness is more widespread covering the cheeks the nose the forehead the chin with rosacea the redness can come and go with acne the redness pretty much goes along with the breakout and it may last long after the breakout has healed that's referred to as post acne erythema now I have a whole video explaining that and how to get rid of that so check that video out and in the beginning with rosacea the redness actually comes and goes but with time if the rosacea is not kept under good control that redness can persist and be there all the time fixed facial redness acne affects the skin rosacea affects the skin and it often can affect the eyes this can appear with bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids swollen eyelids dry eyes and The Sensation of like grittiness in the eyes that is a very important distinction over half of people who have rosacea have involvement of their eyes a trigger for acne is an increase in oil production and people who have acne often tend to have oily skin not 100 of them do but many of them do because the oiliness really feeds the little bacteria that live in the Skin Within the pore and that all leads to inflammation rosacea on the other hand is not necessarily an oily skin condition sure you may have a genetic tendency towards oiliness along with rosacea but the oiliness is not playing a role in rosacea so treatments that address oiliness will not improve the rosacea whereas treatments that address oiliness can help improve acne another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea is what happens when you do nothing when you do nothing with acne the consequence Downstream is that it can heal with a scar there are a lot of different types of acne scars I have videos on this channel as to the different types of acne scars the different treatments for these scarves as a reminder you can have a raised SCAR or you can have a depressed scar acne can also heal with a dark mark or a red mark post acne redness post acne hyperpigmentation rosacea on the other hand left untreated left uncontrolled the consequence of that is that the individual can go on to experienced persistent facial redness that does not go away they also can develop prominent dilated blood vessels and in some cases although pretty rare it is also possible to develop skin thickening in the areas involved with the rosacea this is referred to as feminist change often can involve the nose but it can really affect anywhere on the face where you've got rosacea flares chin forehead in contrast to acne climate as change is not a scar but as you can see it's important to treat both conditions because there are consequences that are long-lasting when the conditions are not appropriately managed another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea are the symptoms acne especially cystic acne can be very very painful but a lot of times acne can also itch rosacea on the other hand is a skin condition where one of the Hallmark findings is the fact that patients are exquisitely sensitive to things that come in contact with the skin whether that be makeup sunscreen perfume skin care products other Cosmetics they're also exquisitely sensitive to the Sun as well as to wind and to just really anything coming in contact with the skin and this leads to symptoms of burning stinging sometimes itch sometimes discomfort sometimes a feeling of heat in the skin when you're asking yourself is this acne or is this rosacea pay attention to the location where you are breaking out acne tends to affect the forehead the cheeks the nose it can affect the neck the upper chest and the upper back as well as the shoulders whereas rosacea tends to affect the mid face like the cheeks over the nose it can also affect the forehead and the chin it can extend to involve the scalp and it also can involve the neck the upper chest and the upper back the people who get acne are a little different from the people who get rosacea although there is some overlap people who get acne most commonly are in their teens are tweens but truthfully you can develop acne at any age including in a newborn and adults as a side note recently I did a whole video on acne in your 40s and above so check that one out we explain why you are still breaking out breaking out for the first time as an adult acne affects all Races all skin tones rosacea on the other hand while it really could occur at any age generally speaking it impacts adults 30 years of age and above of course there are exceptions to that but it generally is a disease that first presents in adulthood all Races can be affected by rosacea it is generally taught that rosacea is a lot more common in people who have paler skin types I have always questioned this because I do think that and people who have a deeper skin tone it's very easy to miss a diagnosis of rosacea because the redness of rosacea can be very subtle in a deeper skin tone so getting a really good history for my patient with a deeper skin tone and always considering rosacea as a possibility is super important I think a lot of patients who have deeper skin tones might accidentally be misdiagnosed as having acne if you don't have blackheads and whiteheads and you also have symptoms of Exquisite sensitivity burning stinging if you feel as though your eyes are are being impacted you've got bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids a feeling of like something in your eye you might actually have rosacea I want to interject why it's so important to distinguish the two accurately because the treatment for one could potentially worsen the other condition so that's why why an accurate diagnosis is King taking a step back let's let's talk about what causes acne as opposed to what causes rosacea the causes are different both conditions likely have an underlying genetic component we can always blame our genetics oh officer I was going 10 miles over the speed limit because it's my genetics it's just in my DNA I digress all right when it comes to acne there are a few factors playing a role acne is a condition where the sebaceous oil gland plays a major role as I mentioned earlier with acne you have an increase in sebum output that is largely governed by genetics again as well as your hormones um whereas rosacea there is no issue going on with the sebaceous oil gland putting out more oil so there's you know that takes that out of the equation with acne you also have a problem with the cells lining the pore not turning over efficiently they kind of get stuck together and that's what leads to those comedones blackheads and whiteheads with rosacea that's not what's going on and with acne as a consequence of the plugging up of the pore and the increase in sebum you have another little Factor down there in your pore called cutie bacterium acne that is a part of everyone's skin but when it's down there in an acne pore and within that comidone and with all that extra sea bomb it starts snacking on that breaks it down into something that triggers a lot of inflammation and that's what leads to painful acne cysts think of rosacea on the other hand as a problem that is a neurosensory issue where you have little nerves that go through your skin and for whatever reason in rosacea the working idea is that the nerves in rosacea release inflammatory mediators apparently upon exposure to otherwise innocuous things that can lead to blood vessel dilation with rosacea there's also some degree of local skin immune dysregulation now in acne I mentioned there's a little bacteria that lives on everyone's skin who is kind of to blame for some of the acne symptoms while that character cutie bacterium acnes is not playing a role in rosacea there is another Little Critter that likely plays a major role in a lot of people's rosacea and that is Demodex mites Demodex are part of everyone's natural skin biology but it's thought that for people who have rosacea they have an abnormal inflammatory response to that little Mite or they have an overabundance of that little mind so you'll see that some of the treatments for rosacea actually specifically Target that part of rose Asia namely ivermecta and topical Ivermectin sold the brand name for that is cilantro so the root causes of acne and rosacea are much different and the things that trigger an acne flare are very different from the things that trigger a rosacea flare with acne you can get a flare from changes in your hormones this is especially the case when you have acne as an adult adult women with acne breakouts a lot of it can be influenced by changes in the hormones the Androgen hormones signal to the oil gland make more oil and that can lead to acne breakouts with acne you also have things that you put on your skin can potentially trigger acne flares if they are comedogenic now skin care products are not formulated to be comedogenic but sometimes sometimes patients find that certain products lead to worsening of acne aggravate their acne especially the kids with very heavy oily Cosmetics or heavy oily hair care products like oily pomades are known to trigger comedones on the forehead or the sides of the face face where the hair touches medications and supplements can trigger acne certain diets may play a role in someone's tendency to have more stubborn acne I I have a video all about a clear skin diet and foods that researchers believe may play a role in acne but suffice it to say the full story on how our foods and diets impact an individual's tendency towards acne are not fully elucidated and acne can have an interesting response to sun exposure some people find that their acne actually calms down a bit with sun exposure but it's clear that acne can get a lot worse after sun exposure likely because exposure to the sun is immunosuppressive but you can get this rebound worsening of acne now rosacea on the other hand let's unpack the triggers there do hormones influence rosacea they probably do to a certain extent but there's not that underlying issue of Androgen hormones driving oil production and leading to to flares that's specific to acne not really it's not a major driving force although you may find that your skin is even more sensitive active with changes in hormones for example changes and hormone profiles around your menstrual cycle may make your skin overall more sensitive more prone to redness skin care products Cosmetics fragrances things that come in contact with the skin are notorious for triggering rosacea and I always get a lot of questions like what skin care products are off limits for rosacea a lot of it really is highly variable and very unique to the individual but in general things like Menthol fragrance ingredients that have cinnamon cinnamaldehyde these can actually trigger vasodilation and worsen redness now heavy moisturizers in rosacea actually can trigger a flare much different from how heavy greasy products might aggravate acne by potentially poor clogging with rosacea a really really heavy moisturizer may actually make you feel a little overheated because it might slow down the evaporate operation of sweat and as you start to feel overheated your body's response to that is going to be to flush and so it can trigger a flush a flare of rosacea with flushing and blushing which is a Hallmark symptom of rosacea upon exposure to things that are irritating to the skin rosacea definitely can be triggered by many different foods I have a video going into detail about different foods that trigger facial redness if you have rosacea you absolutely need to watch that video because there are some mechanisms there that I think will be very helpful for you to understand spicy foods tend to be a culprit likely through vasodilation a lot of people with rosacea are very sensitive to alcohol triggers a flush not everyone for whatever reason red wine seems to be more of a culprit for a lot of people but again it's very individualized so just pay attention to how your skin responds when you do consume alcohol and consider omitting it completely or perhaps it's a certain type of alcohol that's more of a problem for you you also have to be careful with consuming hot liquids like hot tea hot coffee drinking warm soups because that warmth can precipitate a flush of course again this is not true for everyone but it is a relatively common trigger in rosacea you definitely need to be very cognizant of your sun exposure because UV rays definitely are a notorious trigger for a rosacea flare in general people with rosacea are more sensitive to heat that can be from the environment or from sitting next to a heater once they start getting overheated and flush boom that can trigger trigger a flare of course harsh skin care products excessive cleansing definitely can aggravate rosacea something that is common to both acne and rosacea that a lot of people Miss is the fact that both conditions there is an underlying problem with the Skin Barrier and therefore moisturizing can be beneficial for minimizing symptoms and minimizing flare of both conditions it's just a matter of choosing a moisturizer that works for your skin and doesn't actually aggravate your skin so for acne if you find that certain moisturizers seem to aggravate breakouts then avoid those and go with something that is more lightweight likewise with rosacea pick a moisturizer that is more lightweight it's not going to feel heavy on the skin it's going to you know in most cases for people with rosacea it's best to choose products that are free of fragrance and and common irritants like certain essential oils for example because these ingredients they may actually worsen redness cause vasodilation and precipitate a flare so go really mild really boring really Bland now that you know a little bit about how these two differ hopefully these tips in this video arm you with the information that maybe you can begin to distinguish yourself why do we treat acne why do we treat rosacea it's important to treat acne because regardless of acne severity it can go on to lead to permanent scarring which is what we're really trying to prevent and it also can lead to very stubborn hyperpigmentation and very stubborn redness around the acne breakouts that takes a long time to resolve the other reason to treat acne is because it has a huge impact on your quality of life and a lot of people with acne that is untreated they have a lot of mental health consequences as a result so treating your acne could potentially help with your mental health research it clearly shows that having acne is associated with more symptoms of depression and a lot of acne treatments once initiated and the acne improves there is an improvement in the mental health symptoms so that is another potential benefit and the other reason to treat acne is treating it early prevents further flares treating acne also can help give you some relief from the pain and possible itch of painful acne lesions why treat rosacea it's important to treat rosacea because treating it especially early can prevent you going on to have fixed facial redness it can basically help in preventing it from getting worse can prevent you from going on to develop those prominent dilated blood vessels telangentasias and treating it early can help get you some relief from the most uncomfortable symptoms of flushing blushing burning stinging treating rosacea is also very beneficial for your overall quality of life and again your mental health both acne and rosacea untreated can impact your quality of life and mental health which in and of itself is definitely a reason to pursue treatment the other reason it's important to evaluate and treat rosacea early on is to assess for comorbid eye involvement over half of patients with rosacea will have involvement of their eyes sometimes the eye involvement comes long before the skin symptoms and so untreated the eye involvement can lead to eye problems symptoms in the eyes include bloodshot eyes crusting of the eyelids swollen eyelids itchy dry eyes and if not those symptoms persist then that inflammation in the eye can have consequences for your eye health so evaluating rosacea early on in the course and looking for possible eye involvement and treating and addressing that appropriately through you know referral to referral to an ophthalmologist if necessary is really important now I encourage you to see a board-certified dermatologist for evaluation and management so that you can not only ensure that you have the right diagnosis but that you're on the best treatment plan for you treating acne treating rosacea it's not a cookbook approach everyone's acne differs everyone's rosacea differs and what's going to be an appropriate treatment for one person is simply not going to be right for another person it's not a cookbook approach you know you don't take a patient with rosacea and say if rosacea then X Y and Z it's not that algorithmic some things are going to be better options depending on overall symptoms skin lesions severity all sorts of the factors go into go into picking the best treatment for either acne or rosacea anyways guys I hope this video was helpful in laying out how to distinguish acne from rosacea how they differ hopefully gave you a clear understanding that the treatment approaches need to be much different and they're tailored to the root causes of both conditions now as I mentioned I have a video on foods that cause facial redness I'm going to link that on the end slate make sure you watch that if you are dealing with facial redness of any form including related to rosacea because you will identify potentially certain foods that may be aggravating it if you guys enjoyed this video though give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye thank you [Music]",

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and number two for working with us on this video as well as helping make this rosacea education and information possible but remember this is not medical information that's for your doctor to give you do remember to reapply your spf especially if you have rosacea and always remember to be youtiful both inside and out i love you beautiful butterflies and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye you",

        "transcript": "are you struggling with facial redness postural spots or just irritated skin keep watching to learn a holistic approach to rosacea on its treatment in today's video if you're new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret known may be considered it's a powerful retinoid medication that's often used to treat severe acne but it can also be effective in treating rosacea it's only prescribed in specialist centers if you have difficulty accessing and appropriately qualified medical professional there are online Dermatology Services who can assess your skin where you upload photographs and describe your symptoms a dermatologist then assesses your individual case and prepares a personalized blend of topical treatments suitable for your condition and your skin type I use dermatica for my own personalized night cream and contains a retinoid and a pigment reducer signing up with them at dermatica.com or demonica.co.uk and entering the code Dr Finbar on checkout means you'll get a 10 discount of any products that you purchase so rosacea can be a challenging condition to manage but by looking out for your emotional health make an appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments you can take control over your skin and enjoy a better quality of life if these methods alone don't get you the desired results have a look on their Monica's websites for personal treatment plans or visit an appropriately trained Healthcare professional don't let rosacea hold you back you deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your skin now if you found this video helpful watch this short video on how we can start start

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition\u00a0\nthat usually affects the face. Its often mistaken\u00a0\u00a0 for acne, eczema, or an even allergic skin\u00a0\nreaction. It causes redness and visible blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels in your face and sometimes produces\u00a0\nsmall red, pus filled bumps that flare up for\u00a0\u00a0 weeks to months, disappear and reappear when\u00a0\nyou least expect. In this video, im going to\u00a0\u00a0 go over what rosacea is, what causes it, how\u00a0\nto treat rosacea, and 1 very important tip you\u00a0\u00a0 dont want to miss out on when it comes to\u00a0\npreventing it,, so stay tuned till the end.\u00a0 Hi guys, yaseen arsalan, media pharmacist here on\u00a0\nyoutube, this week's video is on rosacea. Smash\u00a0\u00a0 the like button below NOW, as there is a ton\u00a0\nof useful information in here, that I know you\u00a0\u00a0 can benefit from. Also, it helps others find this\u00a0\nvideo as well, iso we can beat rosacea together.\u00a0 Rosacea affects more than 16 million Americans,\u00a0\nwhich is another reason why i wanted to make this\u00a0\u00a0 video. To hopefully point you in the direction\u00a0\nwhen it comes to understanding managing rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and when to let your doctor know. And although,\u00a0\nthe cause of rosacea is still unknown, experts\u00a0\u00a0 believe that the following factors may contribute:\u00a0\nHot drinks and spicy foods,Red wine, alcoholic\u00a0\u00a0 beverages, Temperature extremes, like going\u00a0\nfrom really cold to really hot or vice versa,\u00a0\u00a0 saunas, sunlight or wind, emotions, and even\u00a0\nvarious cosmetic products. Rosacea is more\u00a0\u00a0 common in females than males, and it usually\u00a0\ndevelops after the age of 30. And there is 4\u00a0\u00a0 types you should know of. You have ocular rosacea,\u00a0\nwhich includes eye redness and irritation and\u00a0\u00a0 swollen eyelids. Papulopustular rosacea, which\u00a0\nincludes flushing, swelling, and breakouts that\u00a0\u00a0 resemble acne. Erythemato-telangi-ectatic\u00a0\nrosacea which includes skin discoloration,\u00a0\u00a0 flushing, and visible blood vessels referred to\u00a0\nas spider veins, which you may have heard of. And\u00a0\u00a0 lastly, phymatous rosacea: which leads to bumpy\u00a0\nskin, often accompanied with an enlargement of the\u00a0\u00a0 nose and spider veins can be present too. Although\u00a0\nNo specific test is used to diagnose rosacea. You\u00a0\u00a0 should let your doctor know of the history of\u00a0\nyour symptoms so they can look at your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and rule out other conditions that\u00a0\ncould exist, such as psoriasis,\u00a0\u00a0 eczema, or lupus as the signs and symptoms may\u00a0\nlook alike. If your symptoms involve your eyes,\u00a0\u00a0 your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist\u00a0\n(ophthalmologist) for further evaluation.\u00a0 Now lets look at some treatment option and what\u00a0\ncan you do. Before I go into home remedies you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out starting today, its best to\u00a0\nlet your doctor know of your condition,\u00a0\u00a0 as they most likely will recommend topical\u00a0\nproducts that reduce redness, and can possibly\u00a0\u00a0 be more advantageous, especially if you haven\u2019t\u00a0\ntried them out before. Brimonidine or (Mirvaso)\u00a0\u00a0 and oxymetazoline or (Rhofade) reduce redness\u00a0\nby constricting blood vessels and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 results within 12 hours after use. The\u00a0\neffect on the blood vessels is temporary,\u00a0\u00a0 so the medication needs to be applied regularly to\u00a0\nmaintain improvements. Other topical products have\u00a0\u00a0 less effect on the redness but help control\u00a0\nthe pimples of mild rosacea.These include\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid and metronidazole and take up to\u00a0\n6 weeks to show improvement. Your doctor may\u00a0\u00a0 also prescribe antibiotic such as doxycycline or\u00a0\nOracea for moderate to severe rosacea with bumps\u00a0\u00a0 and pimples. ANd if if your rosacea is severe\u00a0\nand nothing else helps, your doctor may suggest\u00a0\u00a0 isotretinoin which is a powerful oral acne drug\u00a0\nthat also helps clear up acne like lesions of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea or can recommend Laser therapy and other\u00a0\nlight-based therapies to help reduce all that\u00a0\u00a0 redness. Now lets look at what you can do until\u00a0\nthen. There are 5 things you can starting now.\u00a0 #1: Identify and avoid triggers. Pay\u00a0\nattention to what tends to flare you up\u00a0\u00a0 and do your best to avoid them. For some that may\u00a0\nbe avoiding certain foods, hot drinks, alcohol,\u00a0\u00a0 and spicy foods. Eating foods that contain\u00a0\nthe compound cinnamaldehyde, such as cinnamon,\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate, tomatoes, and citrus may be culprits\u00a0\nas well. So pay attention to food triggers.\u00a0 #2 Protect your face. You want to make sure\u00a0\nthat if your exposed to the sun for long\u00a0\u00a0 periods of time, that you Use a broad-spectrum\u00a0\nsunscreen \u2014 which blocks both uv A and uv B\u00a0\u00a0 rays \u2014 with an SPF of 30 or higher. Because\u00a0\nso many sunscreens contain chemicals that can\u00a0\u00a0 be absorbed and cause irritation like octinoxate,\u00a0\noctosalate, or octocrylene you want to avoid these\u00a0\u00a0 chemical sunscreens and opt for a physical one\u00a0\nlike zinc oxide. I left one that i commend in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, so definitely check that out.\u00a0\nAlso on that note, if you live a colder climate:\u00a0\u00a0 try to cover your face in cold weather as this\u00a0\nis known to trigger rosacea as well. #3 Treat\u00a0\u00a0 your skin gently. Don't rub or touch your face\u00a0\nexcessively. Use a nonsoap cleanser and moisturize\u00a0\u00a0 frequently. Avoid products that contain alcohol\u00a0\nor other skin irritants or comedogenic products\u00a0\u00a0 that block the oil and sweat gland openings. I\u00a0\nleft more information on that below too, so check\u00a0\u00a0 that out. #4. clean your eyelids at least once\u00a0\na day if you have blepharitis, otherwise known\u00a0\u00a0 as an eyelid inflammation occurring at the base\u00a0\nof the eyelid. And if youre unsure that you do,\u00a0\u00a0 have your doctor examine your eyelids. Using a\u00a0\nwarm compress loosens the crust and has been shown\u00a0\u00a0 to help tremendously. People who have dandruff\u00a0\nare more likely to develop blepharitis. So Keeping\u00a0\u00a0 the dandruff under control can help reduce the\u00a0\nsymptoms, which can in theory help reduce rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 symptoms as well. #5 Makeup. Some makeup products\u00a0\nand techniques may help reduce the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0 skin redness. Try powder cosmetics with a green\u00a0\ntone and matte finish. I left one as well in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, that has seemed to help others.\u00a0\nSo check that out too. Does it have to be green?\u00a0\u00a0 Green is opposite of red on the color wheel, so\u00a0\nit's perfect for hiding any redness on your face.\u00a0 Now lets look at one of the most effective ways\u00a0\nto prevent it. Which is stress management. For\u00a0\u00a0 those who experience flare-ups as a result\u00a0\nof stress, stress management is an important\u00a0\u00a0 factor in managing your rosacea symptoms. hile\u00a0\nwe may not always know the cause of our stress,\u00a0\u00a0 we do know what relaxes us. Whether it\u00a0\nis reading a book at the end of the day,\u00a0\u00a0 going for a long walk at lunch hour, or\u00a0\neven calling a loved one just to say hello,\u00a0\u00a0 there are little things that we can choose to\u00a0\ndo each day that will help us better manage our\u00a0\u00a0 emotions and have a positive effect on our skin.\nI hope this video was useful to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 and that I hope you do share this video with\u00a0\nsomeone you know who can benefit from it. I also\u00a0\u00a0 hope that you gain just a little bit more control\u00a0\nover your rosacea flare ups.

        "transcript": "if you have ocular rosacea\u00a0\nor even just regular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 this video is for you. Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "transcript": "so when you treat rosacea there's no cure okay that was my question but we can manage it you can make it look like you don't necessarily have rosacea we can manage the characteristics and one of the things we've got to do is we have to down regulate the kiss elicit in protein we have to down regulate those inflammatory factors okay so what is the solution is there's no cure what's the solution okay so number one what i want to stress here is lots of times people are told oh you've got to use these things for sensitive skin and many times they're talking about botanicals and soothing asians some of those things we don't have receptor sites for a lot of botanical some can be good can actually be causative irritants or they can actually cause flare-ups because they are one of the the things that that the skin reacts to okay botanicals are not necessarily soothing we don't have receptor sites for them so it's all about inflammation it's all about those inflammatory pathways so number one i always say there's no exceptions you know you can do whatever you want but this what i'm going to tell you really really makes a huge difference number one is skin care management okay now the skin care management system one of the things that it has in it is it has acids and you and i can just people are going i know acid i'm glad you're here to help help pound this one in today because we hear it all the time dermatologists that's one of the primary tools they have in their arsenal to address rosacea now give you an example bioclear right people watching probably heard about it right it's glycolic salicylic and azelaic acid azolic acid is sold by prescription for rosacea oh it's sold by prescription for acne it's also one of the best resurfacing agents we have ever seen right in terms of pore size and making the skin look really smooth and one of the things that happens progressively with rosacea is that the oil glands enlarge it doesn't mean your skin gets more oily but pores get much larger skin looks very orange peel so it makes a huge difference in in making the skin look very smooth and very resurfaced it's a pigment lifting agent you know you can have pigment you can have acne you can have rosacea all at the same time it's it brightens the skin glycolic acid now glycolic acid is another tool for rosacea there was a study actually done by two female dermatologists who each head up the department of dermatology at two different universities they took two groups of patients they started them off on twenty percent glycolic acid home care now that's aggressive well that's aggressive two weeks later they started doing glycolic acid peels in every single case they are able to um control the secondary lesions resolve them the ones that look like they're acne but they're not they're able to control secondary lesions they were able to decrease the appearance of the telogectasia the redness they were able to halt the progression of the disease because the disease can be progressive and not only that but for those of you who think that the demodex might plays a role and again it's never been proven um they it prevents the demodex mic from being able to colonize in the follicle and glycolic is hugely anti-inflammatory the more anti-inflammatories you use the better off you are and just one more moment on the demodex mite yeah done is they've taken people with severe rosacea and there's some there's rosacea congolata rosacea feminines there's some really exotic forms of rosacea and they biopsied follicles and sometimes they find very small colonies of demodex mite then they take somebody else with mild rosacea or no rosacea and find huge colonies of the mite so we really don't know that the mite plays a role but we do know that the kiss listening protein is a major factor in rosacea so the system that's number one okay okay no exception non-negotiable the number two along with the system we have a product called rosalie now rosa leave is all about the you know all the inflammation and the inflammatory factors but it has a peptide this is there's nothing out there like this it actually down regulates that inflammatory pathway that kiss soliciting okay wow awesome i know you can go on your website i'm sure everybody can go on your website you can see our before and after pictures right yeah they're they're pretty if they're pretty they're pretty impressive they're they're vascular pictures that where you don't just you're not just taking we take the outside of the skin but there's also photos that show the underlying vascular structure and you can actually see the difference in and on my phone it's like over here that you can see it's there's much more dense vascular involvement and on the other side the vascular involvement is much less so wow yeah so it makes it perfect it makes it makes it it makes a huge difference in helping to manage the appearance of rosacea that's good so what if they have that redness and then they have",

        "transcript": "well hey guys i'm a board certified dermatologist and in this video we're going to be covering 10 reasons why your face is red and what to do about it now there are more than 10 possible reasons for facial redness but for the sake of this video i'm just going to cover ten number one is seborrheic dermatitis this is a pretty common skin condition i know a lot of you guys out there deal with it it consists of these red patches sometimes around the nose on the forehead really anywhere on the face the kind of greasy tends to happen in people with a tendency towards oily skin and they're covered with kind of scaliness yellow scale can be kind of flaky this is a chronic skin condition it comes and goes it flares with stress if you get run down or get sick and it can flare seasonally especially in the winter time what can you do about it well this condition is aggravated by a little yeast that lives on our skin that actually is the same cause of dandruff called malassezia and anti-dandruff shampoos help calm down the inflammatory response to this yeast and you can use these on your face the way to use them is to allow them to the affected areas of your face let that lather sit on there for a few minutes and then rinse it off you also can use face washes with salicylic acid and of course see a board-certified dermatologist because there are some prescription treatments that can likewise help as well number two is post-inflammatory erythema this is persistent redness that happens as a result of healing acne the inflammatory response in acne is so robust it can cause blood vessel dilation and a lot of little blood vessel changes beneath the skin that remained for a prolonged period of time even after the acne is under good control this happens in acne that is often cystic and very inflammatory the redness varies in intensity from faint light pink to a deep red and it's not just the face if you had acne on your chest or your back or your neck that can heal with post-inflammatory erythema the good news is with time it will fade provided the acne is treated and under good control how you can get it to go away faster see a board certified dermatologist pulse dye laser ktp laser and even ipl can help calm these down and help them go away faster and in the meantime continuing your acne treatments likewise can help in hastening the resolution of post-inflammatory erythema especially prescription tretinoin because it helps to strengthen the deeper layers of the skin it helps with healing the damage in the deeper layers of the skin including those dilated blood vessels if you have acne and a tendency to heal with persistent redness whatever you do don't pick your acne because that is going to make it more likely to heal with a persistent mark whether it be redness or discoloration and of course sunscreen and sun protection is key because uv rays from the sun including the uva rays that come through window glass as you're sitting by a window slow the healing process down and damage those deeper layers of the skin so ongoing sun protection is imperative number three rosacea rosacea is a really common skin condition it consists of episodes of flushing and blushing at first it's intermittent redness and with time as the condition progresses it can remain persistent you can have little pimple like bumps and this is most often triggered by uv exposure it can happen as a result of consuming hot liquids irritating skin care products spicy food stress but every individual with rosacea differs in terms of what their triggers are if you are dealing with rosacea i suggest keeping a diary of your triggers because moving forward avoiding those triggers is going to be key now i have videos all about rosacea and tips for rosacea so definitely check those out but this is a common reason for persistent facial redness you can see a board certified dermatologist and rosacea treatments can help control the inflammation in the skin that leads to that redness and lasers also can help clear up that redness so the pulse dye laser the ktp they're going to target the blood vessel component of the rosacea and can help with persistent facial redness if you have rosacea keep your skin care routine really basic sunscreen is essential because again uv rays trigger flares a gentle mild cleanser and a bland moisturizer irritating skin care products are very poorly tolerated in people with rosacea including many exfoliants of course it varies from person to person but the safest approach is to keep your routine as simple and basic as possible and not not chase after a lot of trendy ingredients some ingredients like fragrances including menthol can actually have a vasodilatory effect worsening redness number four is allergic contact dermatitis i talk about this all the time in my videos but it is a reason for facial redness you have developed an allergy to an ingredient that you come in contact with it may be something in your skin care products but it may also be something that you use to clean your home it may be something that you're exposed to at work it may be something that you use in your hair care products allergens in skincare products that are most common include fragrance certain preservatives like methyl isothiazolinone this is something that stumps a lot of people because it can happen to you an ingredient in a product that you've been using for years so you may not make that connection that you have developed an allergy to a certain ingredient usually the rash appears a day or so after you've come in contact with the allergen and it can happen most often where exactly where you have come in contact with the allergens so say for example you're allergic to something in your blush you may have contact dermatitis on your cheeks but that's not always the case with allergic contact dermatitis because skin at certain body sites is thin and more vulnerable to developing rashes to ingredients that you are allergic to specifically the eye area so a common presentation of allergy to gold for example is an eyelid dermatitis because you are touching your eyes and transferring that allergen to your eyes how do you know if you have allergic contact dermatitis well it doesn't get better unless you avoid the allergens so in order to figure out what you are allergic to you have to see a board certified dermatologist for something called patch testing to determine what ingredient you are allergic to and then you have to avoid it simple as that number five is irritant contact dermatitis this is different from allergic contact dermatitis and that basically you develop irritation to either an ingredient or a product overall something that comes in contact with the skin but it's not just skin care products that can be irritating household care household products are irritants dishwashing detergent is a common irritant an irritant contact dermatitis in contrast to allergic contact dermatitis it will cause a rash in pretty much anybody provided you are exposed to it in sufficient quantities and perhaps under certain conditions so conditions that lend themselves to irritation are anywhere we have skin on skin contact like under the arms for example but when we're talking about the face skin care products are common culprits in irritant contact dermatitis some skin care products are intended to exfoliate exfoliate and they cause a localized irritant reaction with irritant contact dermatitis it's not even just an ingredient or a product sometimes it's simply using too many products this is why i stressed out you guys to keep your routine simple because the more products you use the more likely for an irritant reaction because you're just using too much it starts to compromise the health of your skin barrier whose function it is to keep irritating stuff out and then you end up with an irritant contact dermatitis say you're layering a bunch of serums some of them have irritating ingredients maybe even fragrance which can be irritating in addition to an allergen so you can see how keeping it simple is is the best approach like my tip for rosacea keep your skincare routine really simple and really bland just switch to a mild fragrance free cleanser and a bland moisturizer and sunscreen for sun protection all right number six is sun damage this is more common in older adults it's more obvious in those with a paler skin type uv rays because they damage the supportive framework of the skin that lends itself to a lot of vasodilation and persistent redness so you may notice for example in older caucasian males have maybe persistently red cheeks with a lot of dilated blood vessels this is a sign of sun damage and it kind of looks like rosacea but it is persistent and it's not necessarily aggravated by things that come in contact with the skin there are no symptoms of stinging or burning like with rosacea there's not really any flakiness like with seborrheic dermatitis laser procedures like pole style laser can help improve the look of sun damaged skin and ongoing use of a topical retinoid likewise can be helpful because retinoids help to improve the strength of the deeper layers of the skin and heal that damage and boost up collagen production improving the look of sun damage including persistent redness number seven is topical steroids all right topical steroids a lot of people actually are phobic of these what are they they're a medication that we prescribe or you can buy one you know a weak one over the counter called hydrocortisone um they're used to treat a variety of skin conditions but for a certain amount of time if you use a topical steroid too long there are risks there are side effects and one of them is persistent redness and the face is especially prone to this this is actually a common problem people self-treat with a topical steroid that maybe they got in the past they develop a rash and they self-treat it with that topical steroid and they keep using it and the steroid calms down whatever inflammation they have but as soon as they stop they get a rebound worsening of redness i'm gonna list some common ones down below in the description box but if you have been ever given a prescription for a cream and you still have it around don't just self treat with that later on down the road make sure that it's a still okay to use it find out what exactly it is because there are potential risks and side effects with self-treating especially in the case of topical steroids and persistent facial redness is an adverse effect from prolonged unnecessary use of a topical steroid to the face now for some people who really need some control of inflammation in their skin say they have eczema and so for those folks who you know benefit from using a topical steroid the goal is to wean them off a bit to either just be using moisturizers and avoiding triggers of their eczema or switch them to a steroid sparing medication now in the case of eczema we have a lot of new medications that we can give that are steroid sparing but there are alternatives is what i'm getting at to topical steroids so a don't self-treat with one and b see a dermatologist if you have a problem that is addressed by a topical steroid and you've been using it for a while just make sure that it's okay to continue using it or you know maybe it's time for you to switch to choose something that would be steroid sparing to spare you of any potential adverse side effects from prolonged use of a topical steroid but i want to emphasize that topical steroids are not bad or scary there is a lot of topical steroid phobia out there that is not you know necessary they are safe but you should only really use them under the supervision of your dermatologist number eight might surprise you but facial redness can come just before a migraine about 70 percent of people who deal with migraines have prodromal symptoms of flushing redness they can develop redness in the eye tearing of the eye a swollen eyelid some cases their ears turn red and the redness you know it resolves once the migraine goes away it's not permanent but that is another reason why you may have facial redness is it can be a sign of a migraine there's actually a study that shows a link between having rosacea and having migraines that's really interesting this can often be accompanied with a sensation of a fullness in the ear and the redness it actually starts out in many cases as turning really pale and then you get a flush and then you have the migraine symptoms of debilitating headache the treatment for this is going to be seeing a neurologist for treatment of your migraine but you know if you have migraine headaches and you're getting facial redness that co that goes along with it definitely it can be a symptom of a migraine this redness can also affect the chest and the neck and again like i said the tops of the ears but knowing that this is a symptom that you're about to have a migraine i think it can be very powerful see a neurologist and they can get you on a treatment plan and just having these symptoms and identifying him and have a migraine that can help clue you into when it's appropriate to take a medication to abort the migraine which if you've ever had a migraine it can be i mean it will it can just debilitate you completely i mean you have to go in a dark room in many cases it is miserable i've had one in my life never again i thought i was having a stroke actually it was very scary and then i realized i was having a migraine all right number nine is diabetes recently i did a video on what diabetes does to your skin if you'll recall from that video you can have persistent facial redness in diabetics it's called rubiosis it's actually pretty common and it can happen not only for the face but like the neck the chest and the upper arms as well and it's thought to be due to the effects of having high blood sugar on the blood vessels that course through the skin leading to dilation and the formation of what's called advanced glycation end products basically kind of glom onto the collagen supportive framework and lead to inflammation and persistent redness now there's not necessarily a cure for this but when the blood sugar is under better control this can improve and last but certainly not least is lupus lupus is an autoimmune disease and by autoimmune what that means is basically your immune system gets super confused and starts attacking you and it can attack different organs and in the case of lupus your immune system can attack a variety of different organs and it can make rashes in your skin the classic rash of lupus is a facial rash referred to as a butterfly rash why if you take a step back and kind of squint your eyes it looks like the shape of a butterfly it involves both cheeks and the bridge of the nose and it is often like either light pink to bright red and it can last a few hours or a couple of days and it often is triggered by sun exposure fortunately when it goes away it does not scar but especially in people with deeper skin tones it can leave behind some discoloration there can be dilated blood vessels but unlike rosacea and unlike seborrheic dermatitis the rash of lupus does not evolve at all the nasolabial folds right here it will spare that so you'll get a sharp sparing of that and that can be a clue that what you're dealing with is more likely a lupus flare how do you treat this well in the case of lupus aggressive sun protection is a mainstay because uv exposure including uv rays that come through window glass can aggravate this disease and so sun protection is essential including not only sunscreen but sun avoidance wearing a broad brimmed hat all the behaviors that we talk about on this channel when it comes to protecting your skin from the sun when it comes to lupus they are a non-negotiable you can't weasel out of them it can put you in the house of pain you definitely need to see your doctor about this one because there aren't any products that are going to address lupus besides sunscreen and in the case of lupus you know it the skin sometimes it can just stay localized to the skin but in other cases it can involve other body systems and so some monitoring may be needed so definitely check in with your doctor and there are medications that can help control the rashes that are applied either to the skin or that are taken by mouth so long story short there are medications that people who have lupus oftentimes need to go on to control their disease it's a serious it's a serious condition not something that you can you know stroll into sephora and find a product that's going to take care of it sun protection is a mainstay all right you guys those are 10 reasons for facial redness but again i've only scratched the surface there are many other possible reasons but hopefully you learned some new ones maybe things you weren't aware of comment below on if you deal with facial redness i hope you liked this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe i'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

type symptoms uh and when you do some testing for that and you treat it that oftentimes will clear up their uh their rosacea [Music] [Applause] welcome to the doctor's pharmacy i'm dr mark hyman that's pharmacy with an f-f-a-r-m-a-c-y a place for conversations that matter and if you've got skin problems you should listen up because this conversation is going to matter to you particularly something called rosacea acne rosacea it's a terrible skin condition we'll talk about what it is but if you have it you know what i'm talking about and it is miserable and today we have with us none other than dr todd lepin who's my colleague a frequent guest here on the special episode of the doctor's pharmacy the house call episode he's a graduate of dartmouth medical school he's board certified internal medicine we've worked together for decades now it's almost 10 non three decades it's kind of scary holy cow you don't look any different than the day i met you so functional must be working uh he is an incredible guy and his teachers all over the world well not so much anymore but you know virtually now actually and and has been uh as part of the faculty in the institute for functional medicine uh american college of advancement of medicine age management medicine and many many other great great organizations so todd welcome back to the doctor's pharmacy thank you mark okay so first of all we're talking about this weird condition that some people never heard of called acne rosacea we're going to talk about what it is how traditional medicine deals with it why that's all wrong and how we approach it using functional medicine so what is acne rosacea okay well that's acne rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition that adults get it's also another name for it is adult acne and patients who have it will get redness to the face usually over the the cheeks and the nose sometimes the chin and you can also be pretty severe you can get uh telangiectasias which are like little uh blood vessels there's like little like blood lines in your face vasodilation of the blood vessels papules pustules so it looks like adult acne is really what it is and interestingly it's fairly common about ten percent of the population has it uh it tends to be more common in people who have celtic origin so irish scottish uh english which is interesting i'll talk about that later i'm jewish from the middle east i'm safe yeah it might be absolutely it might be it might be yeah um and uh a lot of famous people have actually had this uh bill clinton yeah has won uh wc fields uh and bulbus yeah so one of the complications of rosacea is chronic inflammatory changes to the skin so you can get what's called rhinophyma which is basically when you see a clown with the red nose that's rhinophyma yeah that's what right red nose and it can be actually quite debilitating i mean when it gets really really bad you can uh get this distortion of the facial features especially over the nose yeah yeah so it's this really nasty kind of acne and it's what's what triggers it do we know from a traditional medicine point of view well there are a variety of different triggers when people have rosacea uh things that can trigger it are spicy foods uh alcohol can do it yeah i mean alcoholics tend to get this a lot right if you're an alcoholic and wc feels clearly was yeah yeah if those of you who don't know he has google it yeah that's probably before your time but it's it it is often driven by alcohol yeah and i i i my own theory on alcohol as it ties in with that is that alcohol does vasodilate blood vessels but also alcohol in excess is also a big contributor to leaky gut and i always you know i get my patients to understand this uh concept that alcohol can promote leaky gut so i took a shot of tequila and i threw it in your eye what would happen it would burn your eye would water right you're able to get leaky you have leaky eye leaky gut so chronic alcohol ingestion is probably one of the biggest things for low-grade endotoxin and leaky gut and that's also tied in as we'll talk about uh in terms of irritable bowel and yeah we're going to get into leaky gut because that is it's a very big issue general and particularly with things like skin disorders like acne rosacea yeah yeah exactly so so todd um you know in functional medicine we we take a very different view which is we treat things from the inside out not the outside in right dermatology is all about lotions potions and creams and slathering stone on your face to sort of get it good from the outside in but it's kind of it's kind of backwards yeah so what what are the traditional treatments for rosacea and why are they not the best idea you know when i went through my medical training there was an old uh saying that the dermatologist basically if it's if it's dry wet it if it's wet moisturize it and if you don't know what's going on give it a steroid that's that's essentially pretty much right that's pretty much dermatology i learned the same lesson yeah right that's that's that's it and you know dermatology and if if it's wet dry it if it's dry wet it and if you don't know give it a stir exactly that's that's that's the the mantra of the modern uh uh dermatologist um but again it's like you said it's it's it's an external manifestation of something going on internally uh so the question is is what's driving this and uh in in preparing for this talk i mean i've i've seen so many patients with rosacea it's not funny but what do they put on there they give antibiotics on the face yeah they'll give like give like uh uh you know metronidazole cream uh which is topical uh uh anti uh antibiotics it's like an antiparasite antibiotic yeah one of the newer one of the newer medications and this is sort of an interesting thing is a is a cream called ivermectin so this sort of blew me away because this is relatively new and i think we were talking about it it's a worm pill it's a it's a parasite uh they're using it for covet even really yeah yeah yeah so so it's really it was it so it said to my so i i i was reading and i had actually had a patient who came in and was on the ivermectin cream and was doing very very well on the ivermectin cream and then i said to myself well how is an anti-parasitic medication topically helping with uh words yeah well it's also that's also interesting because one of the things that uh is strongly tied in with uh uh rosacea now remember rosacea is just over the face it's it's it's this facial manifestation of an internal uh issue is that we have these little creepy crawlers on our face and they're called uh mites skin mites yeah uh uh uh dermadecks like dust mites we all have them we there everybody has these and the interesting thing is that patients who have rosacea have a much much higher density of skin mites on them for whatever reason and normally they they basically they're like little uh you call them like little parasites that they're ectoparasites and they sit on the skin and they they eat your dead tissues and they they uh eat off of the oils on the on the glands and normally you don't have a reaction to them they're sort of like a benign parasite but in some people who have high concentrations of these skin mites the body makes a very very high immune response to it so uh getting back to the ivermectin which is basically an anti-anti-parasitic it may be actually working as an anti-parasitic for some of these skin mites yeah so maybe there's an infectious cause to this yeah so yeah so yeah so the things they use are menocycline which is an antibiotic flagella or metronidazole which isn't any parasite an antibiotic every mechanin which is an anti-worm oh oral oral doxocycle is another one yeah oral antibiotics which probably is a really bad idea given yeah exactly you have a microbiome you don't want to be killing it to fix your skin exactly exactly yeah and why that why might that minicycline work why might antibiotics orally work well there's a there's a thought and there's actually it's actually in the literature is that uh small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also one of the triggers for rosacea a lot of patients that you see with rosacea will have irritable bowel type symptoms or bloating type symptoms and when you do some testing for that and you treat it that oftentimes will clear up their uh their rosacea yeah um yeah absolutely yeah so i think i think you know we're not averse to using topicals and topical medication when necessary but if you really focus on root causes which is what functional medicine does you come up with a very different set of approaches that actually works better is longer lasting and doesn't require to keep putting on lotions potions and creams for the rest of your life or taking oral antibiotics right exactly and then the way getting back to the ivermectin ivermectin and i uh in preparing for this talk i did some little a little bit of research and the patients who are more prone towards uh rosacea have a problem with too much of what's called uh the catholic side and antimicrobial peptides so these are these mouthful yeah they called camps camp uh catholicism and antimicrobial peptides and these peptides are part of the built-in innate part of the immune system to protect our skin against various types of infections and it turns out that ivermectin actually uh helps with these uh these antimicrobial peptides because people who have rosacea have too much of these peptides they have like an over uh uh robust response to uh antimicrobials so it's it's thought that the uh one of the it's actually a breakdown products called ll-37 and uh ivermectin actually works on dampening down these uh antimicrobial peptides to decrease inflammation in the skin okay so in terms of in terms of the cause it seems to be a combination of internal and external factors right something on the skin and then some things internally but from traditional medicine there really isn't an approach to helping heal the skin from the inside out no no no and whether you have acne or eczema or psoriasis or rosacea or any one of the myriad skin conditions that we get most of them have their root cause inside not on the topical level exactly and and often it's the gut yeah absolutely yeah so you mentioned a little bit earlier leaky gut so take us through from a functional medicine perspective are thinking about the root causes what are what are the things that you think about when someone comes in your office and their face is all red and they've got all this acne on there and they've got like little intel injectation these little red lines everywhere and you can see the blood vessels dilated and they're kind of looking like uh santa claus yeah exactly yeah and also they get they also get photosensitivity too which is the other the other thing and the interesting they can't go in the sun without getting it worse and and that that also ties in with these uh antimicrobial peptides because uh it's thought it's theorized that the the the celts the ones who live in the higher northern uh latitudes they don't get as much sun as we do so it's thought that from an evolutionary standpoint that they benefit by having this they have a more robust immune system when there's not enough sunshine and and sunshine will actually activate this this innate immune system and that's why sun exposure oftentimes makes it worse because they produce more of these antimicrobial peptides and then those antimicrobial peptides have to get processed and in the process of uh breaking them apart the immune system then starts responding to it so that's why there's a sort of a photosensitivity aspect to it and what are the other sort of things you think about when someone comes to your office with rosacea well uh one of the things i oftentimes look at is their vitamin d levels uh vitamin d is is is part of the uh immune system and it uh it's tied in with uh intimately with the antimicrobial peptides system in the body so oftentimes patients who have this have low vitamin d levels uh we'll look at the microbiome testing to see if there's any evidence of dysbiosis bacterial overgrowth testing the sibo testing checking for hydrogen and methane i mean probably the majority of patients who i see of rosacea have problems with with bacterial overgrowth other thing is low stomach acid which also promotes and contributes to bacterial overgrowth yeah so checking for the patients uh sometimes these patients are also on ppis uh acid blocking acid blocking medications absolutely yep yeah because we have acid in our stomach to help us to digest food it's also there to decrease uh the amount of bacteria higher up in the colon so uh it's good it's good to have stomach acid yeah it says if you don't have stomach acid then the ph of your small intestine changes becomes more alkaline and then bugs grow in there that wouldn't necessarily grow yeah and that's when you get this overgrowth of bad bugs in there and it it can be what we call sibo which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where bad bugs migrate up from the lower intestine into the small intestine and then when you eat foods you get bloating distension it causes leaky gut you end up causing damage to the lining of the gut and food particles and bacterial toxins leak in and create inflammation throughout the body and on the skin so you know leaky gut can cause hundreds of different manifestations one of which is rosacea and unless you think about that and learn how to treat it you may not be able to be successful with it there's also another condition that i've seen todd in a lot of my patients called sifo sifo small intestinal fungal overgrowth and a lot of people talk about it as candida but there's many many species of yeast and fungus and and so what i found often is that treating the gut through addressing the bacterial overgrowth the yeast overgrowth healing leaky gut dealing with the food sensitivities makes a profound impact yeah and a lot of times it is food sensitivities that can trigger i mean for example gluten we've talked about on the show that is one of the biggest drivers of leaky gut yeah and even even if you are not celiac and even if you don't think you have any symptoms or don't notice any symptoms when you eat gluten dr alessia fasano who's the world's expert at harvard on gluten he said everybody who eats gluten creates some level of leaky gut right now most people kind of handle it right transient leaky gut exactly so i don't know like it's probably not a good idea to eat that much gluten because of the potential to create leaky gut and how that is linked to so many chronic diseases including weight gain diabetes cancer heart disease alzheimer's autoimmune diseases allergies act i mean you just name it depression all this stuff is connected by by leaky gut so i really i think you know getting a very different thinking about this is key and you you did you talked about the stomach acid you talked about the acid blockers you talked about maybe other things that that you know are relevant in the gut and certain infections like h pylori which is a common bacteria that causes ulcers also has been linked to h pylori and food sensitivities hey everybody it's dr hyman thanks for tuning in to the doctor's pharmacy i hope you're loving this podcast it's one of my favorite things to do and introducing you all

picks p-i-c-k-s and sign up for the newsletter and i'll share with you my favorite stuff that i use to enhance my health and get healthier and better and live younger longer now back to this week's episode so how do we approach these patients when they come in what are the kinds of things that we would do from a diagnostic point of view that you wouldn't get when you went to the dermatologist well from a diagnostic standpoint uh again i would do testing for um you know uh leaky gut that would do intestinal permeability testing checking for antibodies to zonulin with the cyrex testing that we do cyrex array number three so that's basically there's a test that we do at the center for uh at the ultra wellness center here in lenox massachusetts where we're recording live is uh cyrex testing it's a lab that looks at antibodies that you produce against these proteins that are in your gut that come from gluten or even from bacteria and so if you're creating a lot of antibodies to these proteins it's clear that they're getting across the lining of your gut leaking into your bloodstream and causing an immune response which is not only local but systemic right and and i and there are there are other ways you can actually measure zonulin in the blood and you can measure it also in the stool and that's only like a snapshot in time so you can develop leaky gut for you know a couple hours or a day or so but if it if it stops then you're all so fine the antibodies against zonulin is the one that tells you that there's this chronic leaky gut which is really more valuable because if i gave you a shot at tequila then you know an hour later measure your zone it's going to go up okay where's the tequila that sounds good right so so that's why i think that the uh the the testing for the antibodies against uh zonulin is even more valuable in these patients with chronic conditions uh and what other kinds of tests besides the the uh the zonulin and the lipopolysaccharide test that we do to look at the antibodies against these proteins in the gut that come from a leaky gut we'll do the uh the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where we'll measure the production of fermentation products so hydrogen and methane are gases that are normally produced in the body when people have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth those will be produced at higher levels so we can check that and over time i think the test that we do is a three hour test so you measure baseline hydrogen methane check it at uh intervals of about every half hour and you do that over three hour time period that can tell you definitively do or do you not have uh bacterial overgrowth and how bad is it and is it predominantly hydrogen or is it methyl so what you're saying is that is that when we eat foods you know humans don't produce gas it's the bacteria that are fermenting the foods we eat that produce the gas so absolutely bloated or distended or you're passing gas it's not you you can blame it on the bugs but but the problem is that we don't know how to regulate the bucks bugs and get a healthier ecosystem and that and that is what what most physicians never were trained to do yeah and it's the foundation of functional medicine it's the foundation of our practice here at the ultra chobano center where we really dig into these issues and we look at bacterial overgrowth we look at fungal overgrowth we look at a leaky gut we look at food sensitivities we'll do other testing look at whether you're reacting to gluten or dairy or eggs or other foods and it's really helpful in drilling down on what's really going on with people absolutely yeah and that you know we're talking basically producing gases that's basically a fermentation process and normally fermentation happens lower in the colon that's in the in the colonic area the ant when they it's more of an uh uh what's an anaerobic environment or a lack of oxygen and that's normal for that to be happening but when that process is taking place higher up in a different neighborhood it's not a good thing yeah and i mean you want your upper intestine to be sterile and they're mostly sterile mostly sterile and when and all that bacteria migrates up there it's just a bad situation and when we take acid blockers when we you know are low in magnesium which half of us are when we're under stress and our gut motility is slow when we uh you know taking lots of antibiotics and screws up our whole system in there you know all these are reasons why we get these bacterial overgrowth issues and they're super common and they're easy relatively easy to treat with functional medicine now the other thing we do is look at stool testing right so we look at not just the the proteins from leaky gut or we look at the food sensitivities or bacterial overgrowth gas production but we actually look at the poop yeah so what do we what are we looking for in the poop that helps us figure out what's going on well there's a lot of things uh you know there's gold in there uh there yeah it really is it's uh golden them there hills yeah so a lot of uh information can be uh determined by doing a microbial analysis so you can look at the overall balance of bacteria so there are you know everybody's got hundreds of different kinds of bacteria in the in the gi tract and we can measure those using dna pcr analysis and do we can do quantitative we can measure how many uh there are of each different species look at ones that are normally found look at ones that are found in the gut but normally they want to be at low levels look at bacteria that are associated with autoimmunity so things like citrobacter klebsiella salmonella yeah etc uh we can look at now analyze uh for uh yeast overgrowth various forms of yeast um and then also microbial markers of inflammation things like calprotectin looking for fat so you can get a lot of time functioning enzyme function uh butyrate uh checking for beauty chain factors fatty acids indicators of healthy ecosystems so you know todd what you're what you're saying is that you know traditional sort of microbiome testing they just look at the the genetic material of the the microbiome and they can't really test everything although they can do some really extraordinary tests now but there are kits out there where you can look at your microbiome but it it's far more than just what bugs you have in there it's what they're doing yeah so we look at the the result the function on the ecosystem we look like you said the enzyme function you're absorbing your food is your inflammation are you having good bugs in there that are producing the the super fuel for the gut these short chain fatty acids that are so important oh you do have the right balance i've got are you missing some key bugs you have overgrowth of bad bugs you have yeast you have parasites and it's such a much more comprehensive stool test that we do here at the ultra wellness center we were talking earlier about delta sleep and the interesting thing is is that when you have good bugs in the in the digestive tract and you're eating in a fiber in your diet and you're producing higher levels of butyrate that has an effect on the brain and also improves uh uh sleep that's amazing yeah yeah so you have to have your get your poop together to sleep better i got it okay that's the same that's a good good strategy it's better than taking the ambien yeah um all right so we also look at uh you know other things like omega-3 fats and and other fats because a lot of uh inflammation can come from not having the right balance of fat absolutely in your body yep yeah um and and i think you know so so when you have a patient come in what are the what are the steps you would take initially to treat a patient with rosacea from a functional medicine perspective you know the again taking the history is the big one you know um i always will ask people what's your ethnic background a lot of people say you know i'm white you know it's like you know are you irish english german jewish russian whatever because the rosacea is typically found in in light-skinned fair-skinned people and from a genetic standpoint they are the ones who are more likely to have that it's just an interesting part to know to have in terms of the history and then i'll just ask them you know what is it you're eating are you eating a standard american diet uh how much alcohol are you drinking um how much stress do you have stress also caffeine yeah caffeine can play right yeah those are those are all things which can sort of you know it's like adding gasoline to the fire uh because literally rosacea is the skin on fire in the in the in the uh in the facial area but um doing the testing for essential fatty acids making sure that um uh they have the right balance of the essential fats in their diet a lot of people uh are have too much omega-6 which tends to be more pro-inflammatory yeah lack of the omega 3s one of the oils i don't know if you've used it that i found it very helpful with um patients who have rosacea is uh porridge oil and even criminals oil yeah they tend to be very they help to dampen down that inflammatory resistance that's a very key omega-6 that people don't think about much but it's called gamma linolenic acid which is a very powerful anti-inflammatory it's not like the omega-3s but it's sort of like the omega-3s but on the omega-6 side exactly and it and it's something we really have a hard time getting in our diet it's like borage oil and you know a few other things but evening primrose oil so yeah that's very powerful i agree and i also think that you know um when i see these patients i also think about looking for other clues like do they have yeast issues have they been in lots of antibiotics are they on acid blockers which cause yeast overgrowth yeah do they have other fungal issues dandruff do they have anal itching do they have thrush or a white coating in their tongue uh you know do they have vaginal yeast infections do they have other skin markers of use like little tinea or other kinds of things so you'll see often a pattern of other issues around fungal stuff i'll check for h pylori i'll check again all the tests we did talk about and and see what's really going on and then and then you know from the treatment point of view um you know you start with an elimination diet with an anti-inflammatory diet right exactly yeah put it putting patients on an anti-inflammatory elimination diet you know eighty percent of the time doesn't matter what they come in with they're gonna actually they'll actually get better they you know getting them off of the pro-inflammatory foods uh and then putting in foods which are uh anti-inflammatory uh cold water fish sardines wild salmon um uh the essential oils like uh evening primrose oil helped to sort of dampen down that inflammatory response yeah i agree i think you know we don't understand most of us how powerful food is as medicine and how it can drive tremendous amounts of inflammation throughout the body and you know obviously if it's on your skin it's visible but there's also invisible inflammation that you're not seeing that's driving all the chronic diseases yeah and is that you actually just you just you triggered a thought because there's actually a paper that says if you have rosacea you have a higher instance of alzheimer's disease oh wow so it's not just it's not just a you know a cosmetic issue it's actually systemic it's a rich face and a red brain that's on fire exactly yeah is that yeah that's i i was sort of blown away by that that's fascinating yeah especially in women it's actually more more common in women so so you you know you advise people the obvious things cut out the alcohol the caffeine stay away from the sun it's away from spicy foods but we also sell them stereo from gluten which triggers leaky gut often dairy you you you actually add in all the anti-inflammatory foods that are important though all the phytochemicals from plant foods and turmeric and ginger and garlic and rosemary and all these powerful foods that can really help to reduce inflammation and and then we often directly treat the issues that are going on it could be leaky gut so we give them a gut repair program this could be fungal or bacterial overgrowth so we'll we'll take care of those with either herbs or antibiotics or any fungals and you'll see these patients really dramatically improve when they change their diet and they resort their gut and incentives will use like things like even primrose oil i found the digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid absolutely often are really helpful too yeah i've been so i've been surprised at how many people have a what i would call a relative lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach i i was a venture to say that you know the majority of people don't have too much acid that have not enough acid in the stomach yeah well that's interesting because the third leading category of drugs are the acid blockers like prolossic and prevacid and pepsi pepsi and all these other drugs these uh nexium mass effects i mean they're just like out there everywhere and now they're now they're over the counter and everybody exactly yeah i mean i i just i we've talked about this before in the podcast but when i was in medical school the drug reps came in because it's drugs that just come out and they're like listen guys these guys these drugs work they're they're great uh they will help people with ulcers if they're really bad you don't want to keep anybody on it for more than six weeks right those are huge stomach acid it's really bad long term these are the drug reps telling us this and now it's like people are on it for decades and it causes b12 deficiency magnesium deficiency zinc deficiency osteoporosis osteoporosis pneumonia bacterial overgrowth irritable bowel syndrome when you get rid of your heartburn but you get all the other problems yeah it's yeah that's that's amazing and then it's one of those drugs it's so it's so sneaky because it's addictive once you get on it it's hard to get off it because it it causes this rebound so absolutely when you suppress the stomach acid and you stop the drug the acid production goes crazy exactly which makes you feel horrible and then you go i need the drug but you can actually taper it down and use other strategies to help people get off it and you bring it you bring up a really good point because a lot of the the pharmaceutical medications especially some of the psychotropic so the antidepressants are like that too uh the the ppis and the antidepressants when you try to get off of them you get this rebound process the body tries to get back into balance and it's it can be very difficult so you've got to go low and slow when you're trying to taper off the ppis or taper off uh antidepressant psychotropic meds absolutely amazing so so what what cases have you recalled about rosacea that you want to share that can give you a sense yeah well i i had a patient who came in and um she was a undiagnosed celiac not just a gluten sensitivity she was undiagnosed uh celiac um she was irish and she was having a standard american diet and she was self-medicating for her heartburn with over-the-counter uh acid blocking medications it had a lot of bloating type symptoms and came in uh and you know her her major complaint was her skin but you know she had all these other things but her big thing was you know it's how i look right so you know it's it's you know people are vain and people get people's attention exactly right and and then when i uh did a dive into uh her testing you know it turned out that she was deficient in her essential fatty acids especially the gamma linoleic acid um she she had lack of stomach acid because of the ppis you can actually measure a test blood test is a commercially available test called gastrin and gastrin levels will go up when you block acid um so and that's actually one of the tests that i actually like to use when i have patients when i'm trying to get them off of a ppi because the higher the gastrin level the more difficult it will be to get off the ppi uh and that's sort of like it'll tell you how easy uh you can use blockers exactly and then uh she also had uh low vitamin d levels i mean you know we spend a lot of our time clothed and indoors so we don't get enough way enough enough sunshine uh that's that's one of the big things and low vitamin d you don't just fix low vitamin d this is one of my i get up on my soapbox all the time with here is you don't just fix low vitamin d by taking vitamin d now vitamin d deficiency is basically a sunshine deficiency there are certain times when there can be other causes like you might have fat malabsorption that can cause low vitamin d or you may have problems with the synthesis because of uh lack of skin oils which when you get exposed to the sun but by and large low vitamin d levels is related to sunshine deficiency and it's it's that you know low vitamin d is not the problem it's a symptom of another problem yeah and the immune system is also benefited by sunshine exposure healthy sunshine uh i think you said you're gonna be you enjoy going to the uh the tropics now and then caribbean hawaii whatever and we we also feel good it's also i this is another thing that i find fascinating is that there is a uh uh a condition which is called sunshine addiction you know these people who are like suntan addicts well it turns out that our bodies actually produce um uh endorphins when we are exposed to the sun so there's a feedback mechanism that's incredible yeah yeah it's it's there's a it's a there's a compound it's called pro-opio melanocorticotropin hormone and what it means is that our bodies give a reward when we're in the sun so we feel good we have these feel-good molecules these endorphins uh that make us want to get the sun oh that's interesting that's why i love going in the sun exactly no and then there are these people who i always feel so good when i go to the beach in the summer it just makes me so happy exactly and and the interesting thing is it actually you can get addicted to the sun and that's like it's like you get addicted to food i mean your body needs food to survive and your body actually needs sunshine to survive so our nature has built in these feedback mechanisms so that it we encourages us to do it that's incredible yeah i don't know why so what happened with this patient uh what did you do for her well i did a lot i mean i had her work with our nutritionist and got her off of her standard american diet i treated her bacterial overgrowth she had a significant sibo test so i treated that primarily with herbs a lot of people will use antibiotics things like rifaximin or xifaxim for sibo i actually find that i do just as well using antimicrobial herb preparations i supported her stomach acid using betaine hcl uh some patients don't respond to that they they don't tolerate as well so sometimes i'll use things like apple cider vinegar and then uh got her fatty acids up gave her a little bit of borage oil and you know a combination of that and then also just told her to get some healthy sunshine uh it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to go out and sunbathe or go to a sun tanning booth but just getting healthy sunshine can help with down regulating the immune system yeah um and interestingly you know just off topic but with covid there are some really interesting studies that giving high-dose vitamin d helps with uh covet infections absolutely and and so covet actually or vitamin d uh when it's at high enough levels actually helps to keep the immune system in balance it keeps it from getting yeah it controls hundreds of genes it regulates immunity and inflammation it's pretty amazing it's not really a vitamin it's more like a hormone exactly exactly it's like a hormone and it's also it actually likes this acts like a steroid too it's it's a it's a cholesterol molecule moiety and uh um i often times when if i'm getting coming down with a cold or flu i'll up my dosage especially in the winter absolutely it's true and i when i feel like something's coming on and i take like fifty thousand units for three or four days and yeah i never i never get sick yeah it goes away by the next morning it is it's pretty powerful so so todd we've just covered a lot here and i i recall a lot of cases of mine that have had rosacea it's always one of those things where i love seeing because it's so easy to treat and people suffer so much from it and just by following the functional medicine approach looking at the root causes treating the skin from the inside out addressing the gut addressing food sensitivities addressing nutritional deficiencies which is really the foundations of functional medicine these people get better and we we don't just take it at face value but we we actually go under the hood and look at what's going on exactly you know i think there was one great quote i heard somewhere that traditional medicine is like uh trying to diagnose uh what's wrong with your car by listening to the noises it makes instead of looking under the hood exactly and functional medicine is about looking under the hood absolutely and here at the ultra wellness center in lenox massachusetts we've been doing this for decades we have the most incredible team here who collectively have probably 70 years of clinical experience in functional medicine and we're doing most of our care virtually now so wherever you live in the world we can take care of it using virtual zoom consults and uh it's pretty gratifying to see how many people are taking advantage of that and getting better uh and and uh i think that uh you know this is a this is a challenging moment for everybody and i think we we often neglect our own health and our own health care uh nobody wants to go to the doctor nobody wants to go to the hospital anymore but but i think you know people can get virtual care now which is super awesome and uh and we invite you to check it out you go to ultrawellnesscenter.com uh if you're suffering from any skin disorder whether it's acne or acne rosacea or eczema or psoriasis we've had some podcasts on that go listen to them but this is really uh an approach that works for skin disorders i love skin problems because they are so easy to treat whether like i said it's eczema acne rosacea whatever it is it's pretty striking and and it's just heartbreaking to see how many patients struggle with these conditions because they're often so embarrassing that's one thing if you have you know bacterial overgrowth and bloating you're the only one who knows your stomach exploded right but if you've got this nasty looking face or skin issues you don't want to be seen like that and i think this is it affects people's uh sense of well-being and their self-worth and absolutely and i just want to know there is really clear approaches that help this yeah and the exciting thing is is is it's a lot of the conferences that i go to there are now functional medicine dermatologists who get it you know because most dermatologists do not realize or remember that the skin and the gut are contiguous they are connected so when you have a skin problem it's oftentimes an internal problem yeah and the functional medicine dermatologists which are um you know growing um are getting that and they're really helpful yeah i agree it is one of the most exciting parts of functional medicine is dermatology because it's like it's like oh it's such a slam dunk yeah and and uh there are a number of really great functional medicine doctors out there who are dermatologists and and you know the stories are amazing i just i just uh you know see so many people suffer on this unnecessary unnecessarily exactly yeah so if you've been loving this podcast and you know someone with a skin problem or you've got a skin problem come see us here share with your friends and family on social media leave a comment we'd love to hear how you've addressed your skin issues what's worked what hasn't worked subscribe wherever you get your podcast and we'll see you next time on the doctor's pharmacy you",

        "published_at": "2021-11-26T18:06:23Z",
        "transcript": "would you believe me if i tell you that the mites on your face are causing these red angry looking bums also known as rosacea hi friends i'm chris and i'm a dermatology trainee working in the west of scotland in the uk and in this video i'm going to dive straight into the topic rosacea specifically we're going to cover what it is how it looks like as well as the various steps and treatments we can do to help prevent and manage this common skin condition we are also going to touch on the things that you can do to help with your skin as well as the various treatment options we have in dermatology in the uk so what on earth is rosacea well this is a very common skin condition predominantly affecting the middle age groups as well as people with fair skin we don't exactly know what causes this but it is thought to be due to a combination of genes environmental factors as well as an overabundance of a type of mite also known as the demodex mites now these are small little creatures that love growing and crawling around the hair follicles and it's actually present in every single one of us however in people with rosacea it is thought that they are more sensitive to these mites and thereby causing inflammation of the skin leading to flushing and redness rosacea can also be triggered by a variety of things which i've listed in this video and the most common trigger that we see in our clinics is actually direct sunlight and this is why we always advise our patients to wear sunscreen at all times to help prevent rosacea there are of course other known triggers such as caffeine in your tea coffee alcohol spicy food and even exercise and it's actually really anything that makes your blood vessels beneath the skin dilate causing the flushing and redness you see in rosacea now i think it's important for us to classify the rosacea into various subtypes as they can look quite different and also the treatments for each subtype can be different as well one of the commonest subtype of rosacea is the erythematolangitic rosacea also known as the vascular rosacea this can be quite a mouthful to pronounce but essentially patients presents with flushing redness of the face and telangiectasia which also means dilated blood vessels now the flushing is usually temporary at the start but as the rosacea worsens it can become permanent the other very common subtype of rosacea is the papillopascillar rosacea also known as the inflammatory rosacea and in this subtype patients get this angry looking red bumps also known as papules and pasteurs which are essentially papules containing parts inside now i think it is important for us to identify papillopascular variant of rosacea as they can look quite similar to acne vulgaris and so you may ask how do i actually tell the difference well essentially the triggers for rosacea don't necessarily exacerbate acne the other important thing to note is that the lesions for rosacea typically affect the central face so this would include the forehead both cheeks the nose and the chin and they typically spare the temples and the sides of the jawline of the face lastly in rosacea we don't normally get the white or blackheads that you see in acne and these are also known as comedomes which are basically clogged up hair follicles now the other two subtypes are not as common but we do still see them in our practice one of them is called the ocular rosacea and as the name suggests ocular meaning eye patients with this type of rosacea typically get eye symptoms such as burning itching and grittiness of the eyes and if this is left unchecked and untreated it can cause permanent scarring and so it is important for you to seek help quite early on so that you can get the appropriate management the last subtype is the phymatus rosacea also known as rhinophyma now this subtype is particularly difficult to treat and essentially means thickening and deformity of the skin particularly affecting the nose so your usual creams gels lotion and potions that you use to treat rosacea probably wouldn't work for this subtype of rosacea and you may need more aggressive treatments like laser therapies and even surgery so now you may ask how do we treat rosacea the important thing for any subtype of rosacea is to identify and potentially avoid or limit any triggers triggering rosacea what i'll recommend is to keep a diary for anything that can exacerbate your rosacea and try to limit or cut down one trigger at a time you don't have to be prescriptive about this because ultimately it is your quality of life we are talking about and it's all about weighing the pros and cons when it comes to avoiding things you may like so for example if your rosacea is triggered by eating spicy food and you just so happen to love spicy food and you eat spicy food every single time it is probably quite difficult and even impossible for you to limit eating spicy food because it will just make you very miserable so instead of avoiding things completely you may wish to perhaps limit the amount of exposure and be more rigorous when it comes to your skin care regime another important thing you can do is to treat your skin as though it is super sensitive always always remember to wear a good sunscreen as we know sunlight is the number one trigger for rosacea wearing sunscreen not only prevents rosacea it also helps reduce the risk of skin cancer and slows down aging another tip is to use non-fragrance and non-comedogenic facial cleansers and moisturizers which help protect the skin berry function try to find cleansers that are more acidic with a ph similar to the skin so between four to five rather than harsh soaps which are more alkaline and can be quite irritating and traumatic to the skin an example you can try is the serraphy hydrating facial cleanser another important tip is to keep your skin care as simple as possible now for patients who have sensitive skin who are more prone to getting acne and rosacea i would advise against using toner because toner can actually strip off the essential oils and moisture in your skin making it more inflamed so for specific subtypes like for example the erythematologic rosacea other than the advice that i've given before and doctors in the uk can also prescribe a topical gel called movaso gel which contains bromonidin 0.03 now this is licensed and indicated for facial redness and flushing and we typically advise patients to use once a day the only issue with this gel is that it can cause rebound redness when it's stopped and so it's often quite difficult when patients try to come off it another treatment that we can offer in the uk is an oral medication called propranolol which helps to shrink down any dilated blood vessels now as you can imagine this is an oral tablet so it can cause systemic side effects such as slowing your heart rate down and so this is something that we don't normally prescribe in the uk for rosacea unless it is absolutely crucial also if your facial redness is permanent causing discomfort and psychological distress sometimes we can think of laser treatments for example ipl and housed dye laser the only thing is that i'm not exactly sure if these treatments are still available under the nhs which is the national health service for those people living in the uk as such and you may wish to consider going for these treatments privately but make sure that you seek out a reputable and recognized healthcare professional who knows what they are doing you may also wish to consider camouflage makeup with a green tinted base to help correct the redness and help even out the skin tone now in the uk there is a camouflage service provided by a charity called changing faces and this is something that you can register either yourself or get your gp to refer you onwards to this service and in this service what they do is that they would look at your skin tone show you the products that they use the different shades that would match your skin tone as well as how to apply the products now for people who are suffering from the papillopascular type of rosacea we do have a variety of treatments available for people who are suffering from mild to moderate symptoms we can offer topical treatments in the first instance and in the uk there are three mainstay topical treatments we offer the first one is ivamatin cream also known as cilantra which you can apply once a day to the affected areas for up to four months the other treatment is metronidazole gel also known as rosex gel which you can apply twice daily for up to four months and lastly we have the acelic acid 15 cream with the brand name being called phoenicia and we often ask patients to apply to their face twice a day for up to six months these treatments are typically prescribed by your healthcare professional in the uk but i think you can get the acelic acid treatments over the counter through brands like the ordinary products choice as well as natural once the rosacea is more well controlled you can then reduce the frequency down to once or twice a week as a form of maintenance therapy if your symptoms are more severe then we may consider a combination of oral antibiotic and the topical treatments and the oral antibiotics include things like lemon cycline and doxycycline now bear in mind this is a prescription only medication and so you may wish to speak to your healthcare professional like your gp or local dermatologist in your area to find out more the aim of using antibiotics is more for the anti-inflammatory properties rather than antibacterial and typically patients stay on the antibiotics for at least three months for it to actually work now if the symptoms continue to be persistent despite topical and oral antibiotics sometimes in dermatology we offer low-dose isotretinoin also known as roaccotin now this is a treatment similar to that for acne severe acne in fact but actually the dose used for rosacea is much lower than that used for acne now as for people suffering from the phymatis variant of rosacea and the topical treatments and as well as the or antibiotics they won't work because of the deformity and soft tissue swelling in this case sometimes we can refer you onwards to laser treatments as well as surgical interventions to help remove the excess soft tissue and as far as i know these services are still available in some health boards across the uk so you may wish to speak to your local dermatologist to find out more now for people who are suffering from eye symptoms or ocular rosacea other than minimizing the aggravating factors like for example excessive central heating excessive air conditioning and even smoky environments i think it is important for you to make sure that you keep your eyelids as clean as possible this means cleaning them with a cotton wool soaked in warm water and if you get sticky bits underneath your eyelids you can wash them with using baby shampoo also if your eyes get dry you can buy over the counter lubricating eye drops and try to go for the ones without preservatives to keep your eyes moisturized throughout the day one thing that people don't realize is that sometimes medications can exacerbate eye dryness so have a look at your regular medications particularly if you are on a lot of regular medications such as certain antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications as they can sometimes exacerbate eye dryness in dermatology we sometimes use all antibiotics to help dampen down inflammation but if your eye symptoms are very bad and severe we can refer to our ophthalmology colleagues in the eye clinic for their review as well now before i close off this video i just want to say that oftentimes we underestimate how distressing skin conditions can be for people i know that it is not the same as say if someone suffers a stroke or a heart attack rosacea is not life-threatening but they can cause a huge impact on our daily activities and social life skin conditions can make you look and feel different from the people around you and this ultimately can cause you to lose confidence in yourself and cause self-esteem issues i just want to say that for anyone who is watching this video suffering from any skin condition no matter how severe or mild it may be and if you are suffering from this and please don't suffer this alone speak to someone about it and get help as soon as possible there are tons of support groups online and that can help support you through this journey i myself suffered from really bad severe acne and this had caused significant long-term scarring which i still have to this day and so i hope by doing these videos i would empower you guys including healthcare professionals and with the necessary tools and knowledge in tackling of these skin conditions at an early stage i will also provide several links down in the description box below which you may want to check out if you want to read out more about rosacea and if you're interested to know more about skin conditions in general do check out my video on keratosis polaris where i talk about another very common skin condition that pretty much almost everyone suffers from thank you for watching see you later bye",

        "transcript": "(upbeat music) So the nose is about rosacea sometimes, unfortunately. So the nose breaks out with pimples, and that's rosacea and that can be pretty much of an issue. So, I think that we're gonna have some things come cranking out towards us in a minute. Look at that. So, what flares rosacea? What flares the nose pimples? Red wine! I can keep my red wine! (laughing) She's a bad patient! I know, I know. The hot, the jalapenos, I can eat these. I just love them. Me too. That's bad for your nose? They make nose acne worse. They make your nose red, they flare your rosacea, they do, so they're a sometimes to know so I'm going to stick them over here. I'm really glad I don't have zits on my nose, because I'm not giving up that, either. This salsa, if it's really spicy. Same deal. (audience saying awww) It's a no. Okay, well, just live with zits on your nose. Coffee and tea, they're a no. My nose, okay, that's pretty much my entire daily diet. My nose should've straight up fallen off my face. And she has a really cute nose. I'm looking right at it. A long time ago! I want you to do Omega-3s, like better in salmon. That's really gonna help you. I don't really like salmon, but I'll trade it for some halibut. And then, Brussels sprouts are really, really good. Sincerely, can we use any seafood? Because I don't love cooked salmon. I like salmon... And so, Omega-3s in salmon or other cooked seafood, yeah. So, I can eat other fish and get my Omega-3s. Exactly. It's not the only fish. Absolutely not. And any cruciferous vegetable or just Brussels sprouts, specifically? Any cruciferous vegetable is fine. They're all good for your skin? They're all good for your skin, yeah. That's if you're prone for your nose.",

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can check it out also if you want to Deep dive on information about any of these skin conditions you can actually search Cassandra Banks and rosacea or Cassandra bankson sunburn or Cassandra bankson skin condition in the YouTube search bar and we've probably done a video on it specifically if you search Cassandra bankson how to treat a sunburn I've shared with you some of my best tips and tricks as well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this next video love you guys hey",

        "published_at": "2023-02-03T17:00:28Z",
        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign
