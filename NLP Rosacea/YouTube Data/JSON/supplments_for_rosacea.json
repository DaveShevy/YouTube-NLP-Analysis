        "transcript": "well hey guys happy Friday so for the Q&A today I get many questions from you guys about if I can talk about or address the relationship between diet certain foods and skin and skin health and last week's video was talking all about cilantro for rosacea and many of you out there suffer from rosacea and had asked me if I could talk a little bit about foods and diet and rosacea and what role if any diet and dietary supplements might play in rosacea control so for those of you out there suffering from rosacea you are keenly aware of how to billeting it can be to cope with it is a skin condition that is chronic there is no cure for it and it consists of a hypersensitivity - otherwise innocuous things that come in contact with our skin and as a result the skin reacts by causing the little blood vessels in the skin to dilate really quickly and that can lead to persistent and fixed facial redness as well as red bumps and pustules and swelling at the skin of the face in addition to the symptoms of stinging burning tingling with your face is on fire so this can be incredibly debilitating and the cosmetic consequences of the persistent facial redness and bumps can really really take a toll on your self-esteem and really it really leads you to try and take desperate measures and I know many rosacea people have there have tried everything and so I hope this video will be helpful and kind of addressing dietary things that may be helpful now the exact cause of rosacea as I've said my other videos is not entirely well worked out but we know that it is likely a combination of multiple factors first and foremost being your genetics which you cannot change furthermore it reflects a dysregulation in the immune system in the skin as well as a hypersensitivity of the little neurons in the skin and the blood vessels in our skin there's also a role for a dysbiosis of the skin and gut microflora which I'll touch a little bit on as well many of you had asked me asked me about the role of the gut in skin health and in rosacea so I will touch on that as well foods really play a major role in not only triggering a flare but also potentially modifying your diet can also help to calm down the symptoms of rosacea there was a survey that was conducted of over 400 patients with rosacea 73% of those patients reported that they had made some modification in their diet as a result of their rosacea in other words they identified food or an ingredient that they felt precipitated a flare of their rosacea and they altered their diet and of those who altered their diet 95% of them reported that the alteration they made in their diet resulted in improvement in their own sation so that really underscores that yes diet probably does play a significant role in the severity and control of rosacea what types of foods are known to play a role in triggering rosacea they fall into four or five categories the first is heat related things that are just warm foods hot liquids hot broths which is really unfortunate because in the wintertime in particular when you're in a cold climate not only can your rosacea flare because the ambient humidity in your environment has gone down and now you've got dryness and your skin is even more sensitive and even more reactive but you want to come inside and curl up with a nice warm mug of tea or have some hot soup not actually it will bring heat to your face and precipitate a flush of rosacea so merely you know hot temperature foods kind canna do kick off a flare so if you have rosacea you kind of have to stick to lukewarm to you tepid temperature foods which is really really a drag i I can't I can't imagine having to do that I love hot hot coffees and hot teas that brings me to a side note many of you have asked me about the role of coffee and if drinking coffee and caffeine consumption can help our harm rosacea and it's interesting for many many years we always thought that drinking coffee because the liquid is hot probably is associated with worsening rosacea and precipitating a flare however there was a study that came out recently that showed that people who drank coffee actually had a lower risk of rosacea now that particular study was subject to certain potential biases namely people with rosacea are probably more likely to avoid coffee and avoid hot liquids and therefore have less exposure to coffee whereas people without rosacea don't have the Associated flush so there are probably more likely to consume coffee so it might explain that bias but a potential helpful component of coffee consumption is that caffeine can constrict the blood vessels in the skin and that obviously can improve redness that is associated with rosacea so for those of you wondering out there about coffee and that new study that came out it does suggest that maybe maybe caffeine consumption particularly the high levels that are present in coffee as opposed to chocolate and tea because it didn't see that protective effect when people consumed called chokolate or tea then maybe caffeine caffeine might be helpful but again but take it in moderation don't overdo it on the caffeine and give yourself the jitters the other category of food beverage that will definitely worsen rosacea and again debbie downer it is alcohol wine beer hard liquor even a sip of alcohol will can and does kick off a flare some people metabolize alcohol more slowly this can be particularly problematic if you are of Asian ethnicity but oftentimes people of different Asian ethnicities have difficulty metabolizing alcohol as efficiently and they have a build up of metabolites that results in redness and flushing and so they're more prone to flushing and redness so if you are of that those ethnicities you know that you flush readily when you consume alcohol if you also happen to have rosacea alcohol is it's really really a no-go but that goes for anyone with rosacea unfortunately I mean the holidays have to be the biggest drag not only can you not like tuck in with a hot with hot chocolate but you can't have a glass of champagne or a glass of wine without worsening your rosacea so that is the other category of food people with rosacea then the other category of food is in the family of things that contain capsaicin capsaicin is what is responsible for burning and tingling of foods is what is in spicy foods it is present in chili it is present in cayenne and it is also present in red peppers so if you have rosacea you need to be very careful that the foods you ingest don't contain these spices and peppers and things like that that definitely it can precipitate a flare of your rosacea lead to persistent worsening of of rosacea symptoms and then the other category of foods which are probably more ambiguous to you and you may not be as familiar with are those that contain something called cinnamaldehyde cinnamaldehyde is present in many foods many unrelated foods so this can be really challenging to identify and to avoid not only is it present in a lot of foods but it's also present in a lot of fragrance and skincare products out there that's why I always in Causton you guys to avoid fragrance even if you don't have rosacea to avoid fragrance and essential oils because cinnamaldehyde are often often very very abundant in those fragrance mixes and in those essential oils and in those plant derived ingredients and cinnamaldehyde it's irrespective of if you have rosacea or not cause there vasodilators so applied to the skin is like why would you want to do that unless you just want want a rosy glow but that's that's really not not a great thing to go pursuing that way just use blush if you have to but anyways sin and aldehydes not only applied to the skin and your skincare products but when ingested they can cause redness and blushing and increased sensitivity and worse and worse worsening of rosacea they are present in tomatoes they're present in chocolate again Debbie Downer no hot chocolate no chocolate no alcohol I mean this this is no fun there are present in cinnamon as well so if you are at all a fan of hot lattes that are often dusted with cinnamon got cinnamon dusting on the top of your lattes and your hot beverages can worsen your rosacea all the fun foods around fall and winter they all often have cinnamon nutmeg is another one that also has syntax cinnamaldehyde in it that you have to avoid and then citrus fruits also another winter favorite citrus fruits grapefruit lemon this is again why I always caution you guys another reason to avoid lemon peel and citrus fruit extracts and your skin care products they contain cinnamaldehyde switch aphasic dilators but for people suffering from rosacea you even have to dial it back further and consider consider if they are applying a roll and you're dyeing it in worsening your rosacea symptoms so those are the foods and food categories I will list these down below in the description box for you guys but what I would encourage you if you have rosacea what I would strongly encourage you to do is to get a diary and keep a daily at rosacea diary how your symptoms are what you ate that day what you used on your skin what the temperature what the weather was like just keep a really rigorous journal of all the things that you do on a daily basis and come in contact with this can really really be helpful in rosacea knowing what the weather was how the humidity was knowing what food you consume that day knowing if if you have the heater on if the heater was running and knowing if you were outside that day exposed to light these are all things that can help you help you kind of solve the mystery of your rosacea and you can help and can help you to identify triggers trigger avoidance is imperative in rosacea management rosacea as I've said is a chronic disease there's not a cure for it and in order to put the brakes on getting to that persistent fixed facial redness and even improve that you have got to really really dial in the triggers and that includes foods so hopefully this video is helpful to you guys in that manner alright so this is the foods and things to be aware of and again keep a diary but I mentioned earlier that there's some dysbiosis between the gut and the skin microflora and rosacea everybody has heard I'm sure in the media and wellness blogs and and everywhere about the skin in the gut microbiome this is an area of active and prolific research that's really really interesting and our gut is colonized by micro flora as well as our skin that release different chemical mediators and immune regulators that help to control inflammation and really help to protect our barriers our barriers being our skin and our gut their barriers to the outside world and there can be some dysbiosis and dysregulation in the gut flora the skin flora that can either be what's predisposing people to rosacea or if you have a diet that doesn't support a good gut microflora that can actually worsen your rosacea we do know that people with rosacea have a higher prevalence of certain diseases of the god inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease a-kor occur more at higher prevalence rate of people with rosacea having rosacea does not mean you're going to get one of those diseases but there is a correlation there is also a correlation or a prevalence and increased prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in the gut that is little bacteria that contributes to ulcers and so if you have rosacea and you have h pylori there is there is an association between that and it's been shown that when that is treated sometimes the rosacea can get better so we know that and people with rosacea with diseases of the gut that when their gut disease is under good control it can actually help their rosacea quite a bit so if you are suffering from one of those those stomach and gut conditions that I mentioned following up with your healthcare provider your gastroenterologist and getting good control of that you may see it you may see improvement in your skin likewise when flares your rosacea may be one of the first clues what is a good way to restore or to improve or enhance the gut microflora well one way that you may have heard about it's a consumption of prebiotics and probiotics prebiotics are non digestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the government the growth of good gut bacteria and they're basically fiber plant fibers you know you can take a fiber supplement as a way to get prebiotics but it is thought that eating a plant rich diet and I'm not talking about a vegan diet or any specific diet I'm just talking about making sure that you get at least the daily recommended allowance of vegetables and fruits with good sources of resistant starches and fiber that can really give your gut the the food the meat literally the food that it needs to support the growth of that good bacteria so that's prebiotics largely fiber what the what the bacteria in your gut need to thrive so that lends itself to suggesting that making sure you get those rich plant sources of fibers can can really help potentially your rosacea we don't have any data to share that really suggestive then probiotics are actual live microorganisms that you ingest and they can colonize the gut and helped you restore some healthy gut microflora and these are present in a lot of fermented foods like kimchi yogurt what else kombucha you know they're really popular sauerkraut I love fermented foods so supplementing with foods that are rich in probiotics is another way but bear in mind those probiotics they need they need the good food so if you only take probiotics and you only take a probiotic supplement without that fiber component you're really just kind of spinning your wheels that point so you definitely want to make sure you include both of them if that's something that you're considering but at this point there's really no strong consensus evidence to to say a specific supplement or regiment of probiotics and prebiotics is is like standard of care for rosacea but do you know there is some evidence to support to support that for inflammatory skin diseases the last thing that I'll touch on are supplements supplements the supplement industry first of all is like the cosmetic it's like the skincare industry the claims they make are not regulated at all so you know they can they can tell you whatever they want all right so I'm hopefully the information that I can give you is objective as possible so that you can make an informed decision yourself but suffice it to say there is no convincing evidence at this point that any specific nutrients act to alleviate rosacea we have a small amount of data that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids can be helpful for rosacea very very limited research showing this we have a small study specifically that showed that people with rosacea that effected the eyes they had some improvement in their eye symptoms when they consumed 325 milligrams of EPA and 175 milligrams of DHA twice a day for three months that was a small study and that's really really about it at this point as far as as far as omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in rosacea rosacea so too early to say anything for sure but do you know that that data that those data are out there and then the other supplement that we have a little bit of data for is zinc zinc is anti-inflammatory and there's one small trial that showed that supplementing with a hundred milligram one hundred milligrams of zinc sulfate three times a day was helpful for rosacea however another randomized control trial showed no different so at this point the studies are conflicting as far as ink supplementation suffice it to say rosacea certainly is influenced by diet and the foods that you consume to take ownership of your health and control of your rosacea again I really would push you to keep a diary of not only the foods that you consume but skincare products that you're using as well as the weather the what type of exercise you did that day and kind of how good or how bad your rosacea was on any given day this is him seem like a lot of work but it is going to enhance the outcome significantly of any treatments that you pursue for your rosacea whether it be you know you're starting a new medication for the rosacea like some of those that I've talked about before you want to invest in pulsed dye laser for the redness of your rosacea like I've talked about before any of those treatments for rosacea they really need you to come full circle with really really eliminating as many if not all triggers of your rosacea in order to have the best outcome rosacea definitely takes a toll on your overall emotional health for sure it can be incredibly distressing to have to figure out all these triggers to cope with the redness the flushing can make social situations incredibly difficult particularly around the holidays particularly this time of year when the temperature starts getting colder I mean symptoms of rosacea can really really get get rubbed off but I hope this video is helpful to you guys and kind of addressing what we know about diet and rosacea to allow you to make some informed decisions for yourself don't be misled by the supplement industry to thinking that there is a dietary cure for rosacea there's certainly not but modifying your diet definitely it can and does play a major role in and taking back control of your skin so I hope this video is helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at

won't need those anymore now everyone who's already reversed their rosacea with a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet I need you to do me a favor in the comments below I need you to tell your story

        "transcript": "well hey guys as you know there are a ton of supplements out there that make all sorts of claims about benefits for the skin things like collagen gummies hyaluronic acid tablets now i've covered a lot of these supplements in other videos so definitely check those out but in this video we're going to be talking about a dietary supplement with actual good evidence to support its use for skin benefit if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i'm a board-certified dermatologist if you like skincare skincare product reviews anti-aging tips consider subscribing or follow me over on tik tok or instagram i post on those platforms pretty consistently as well so what is this mystery supplement you speak of it is nicotinamide otherwise known as niacinamide yes that's right the b vitamin vitamin b3 which is in pretty much every skin care product these days i know you guys commiserate with me in the comments a fair amount on how niacinamide while a good ingredient in care products it seems to be something brands are just pumping in left and right and some people do find it irritating anyways i digress and if i use nicotinamide and niacinamide interchangeably throughout this video my apologies just know they mean the same thing vitamin b3 this is a water-soluble form of vitamin b3 and it's actually important as a precursor for something called nad and nad is important in the process of repairing damaged dna so we're thinking about the skin one of the biggest stressors that your skin has to deal with on a day-to-day basis is environmental stressors ultraviolet radiation pollution infrared radiation specifically ultraviolet radiation damages the dna in your skin cells and it also suppresses the immune system that circulates throughout your skin to kind of clear out damage and that is one of many reasons why sun exposure contributes to skin cancer formation later on later on in life it's the immunosuppressive properties as well as the damage to dna nicotinamide is helpful for repairing damaged dna it's anti-inflammatory and it inhibits that sun-induced suppression of the immune system in the skin where the heck do we get nicotinamide is it something that is in the water do we make it ourselves largely we get it from our diet you can find it in fish poultry legumes certain grains it's also in a lot of fortified foods and in nuts unless you follow an incredibly restrictive diet there is a good chance you are getting vitamin b3 in your diet so why would you need to supplement and is it even beneficial well turns out because nicotinamide is anti-inflammatory it has been studied in dermatology as a dietary supplement for a few skin conditions namely a condition which we won't get into in this video for time's sake well as pemphigoid this is a blistering disease that often affects older adults it can be triggered by medications in combination with another anti-inflammatory together can help treat that condition which is a blistering disease because niacinamide can help in repairing damaged dna as well as putting the brakes on that uv mediated immunosuppression in the skin it has been examined in clinical trials as a supplement to perhaps mitigate skin cancer formation older adults who have a lot of sun damage they make this skin lesion called an actinic keratosis and actinic keratosis is a precursor to a skin cancer the more actinic keratosis that you have the greater the risk that you will have skin cancer and it's just kind of a reflection that you've got a lot of sun damage going on and those patients often have to come in more frequently for skin checks and have these actinic keratosis frozen off and removed anyways so a clinical clinical trials have been done looking at nicotinamide 500 milligrams twice a day for four months and people who have a lot of actinic keratosis at the end of the four months people getting nicotinamide in these studies had statistically significant fewer actinic keratosis in comparison to people getting the placebo in addition to having a lot of sun damage another group of people who are at a greater risk for forming skin cancers are people who have had organ transplants because they are taking medications that suppress their immune system so they're not able to clear out those damaged cells in the skin as well because of that they are at a greater risk for forming skin cancers and they often make a lot of these actinic keratoses so one study looking at this population of people getting 500 milligrams of nicotinamide again twice a day for six months at the end of the study those individuals had statistically significant fewer actinic keratosis now i keep saying 500 milligrams twice a day and one of the studies they actually looked at taking it once a day and while the once a day dosage did decrease the number of actinic keratoses relative to placebo is not as much as taking it twice a day now once you make a skin cancer like a squamous cell carcinoma or a basal cell carcinoma your risk of making another one is quite high and that is why once you make one and have it removed you have to keep going back to the dermatologist to have skin checks to monitor for new ones coming up so in one study people who had already had one non-melanoma skin cancer they were enrolled in this trial given 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice a day for a year at the end of the study there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of new actinic keratosis that these people were making in comparison to placebo but importantly that effect went away after they stopped taking it so bottom line taking 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice a day may help in reducing the number of pre-skin cancers that people make who are at risk for making them however you have to keep taking it in order to maintain that benefit so once you stop you lose the benefit you'll just go back to making the same number of actinic keratosis all right so that's the people who make a lot of skin cancers you know they're they already have a lot of sun damage we're talking older adults a lot of these studies were done in australia where the uv is quite potent what if you're somebody who you know is in your 20s your 30s you have never had a skin cancer before you're pretty good about sunscreen or whatever is this beneficial to you there's no research to suggest that you need to be taking this um because you know it's only been really looked at in these populations who are at risk and again as i said it doesn't it doesn't protect you from a sunburn like sunscreen will so whether or not people who don't make skin cancers yet or have significant sun damage are are a transplant patient making a lot of skin cancers or pre-skin cancers it doesn't seem as though it is necessary we don't we just don't have the research to support everybody taking it it's not free to take it it's a supplement you got to buy it and like i said in those people for which this has been studied for they have to keep taking it in order to maintain those results so for just everybody to take it it may not be like the most cost-effective logical thing to do how safe is it to take nicotinamide is it dangerous is it harmful are there adverse effects that can occur yeah i mean you can run into problems with it for sure if you take very high levels um 500 milligrams twice a day appears to be very well tolerated with no side effects and so that is what is recommended to these patient groups however you definitely can run into dangerous side effects when taking very high doses you can get into toxic ranges if you take too much three and a half grams per day will definitely get you to toxic levels that can damage your liver so starting out you have elevation and the liver enzymes you can develop nausea vomiting headache it'll make you dizzy fatigued and it also can interfere with the platelets platelets are the component of your blood important for clotting and so if you have low platelets this may not be the best thing for you it could potentially interfere with that especially at high levels you know nicotinamide this is a dietary supplement but it's also sometimes added to like drinks energy drinks and stuff like that so you can imagine how depending on your lifestyle and you know if you're taking a lot of supplements you might actually end up running into the territory where you are getting to too high of an amount of this that is one problem with dietary supplements they're not regulated so a lot of times you can get high levels of things and on you know unknowingly so same thing happens with b12 supplements you know i i have to take b12 because i am a vegan but uh some people take b12 and then they drink energy drinks with b12 added and then maybe they take some other kind of supplement that has b12 in it and too much b12 is associated with triggering acne for a lot of people and they just don't even realize how much b12 they are consuming so remember it's not the poison it's the dose if you don't read the labels very carefully you can easily get too much so that is one word of caution if you are like reading about nicotinamide or you know thinking about it first of all hasn't really been investigated for benefit for just generally healthy people and second of all you can get to toxic levels uh and that can seriously damage your liver the other thing about nicotinamide supplements is that there is potential for medication interaction so if you take medications um definitely discuss with your health care provider before considering the supplement especially if you take the drug carbamazepine uh it is a medication some people with migraines take and some and it's an epilepsy anti-epileptic medication so nicotinamide can interfere with the metabolism of that drug and make it get to too high of a level in your body so that is a potential adverse effect all right so you're probably like bummed out right like i i'm not just here to tell you that this is the end-all be-all there's data to support giving it to people who make a lot of skin cancers but young otherwise healthy people your focus should be on protecting your skin from the sun with sunscreen and sun protective clothing not sunbathing you're better off putting your efforts there than in chasing after taking this as a supplement now i mentioned this at the beginning of the video kind of joking around about topical niacinamide or nicotinamide same same thing and you will find that in a ton of skin care products and it's actually very beneficial for a variety of skin issues when applied topically because it's anti-inflammatory it's an antioxidant so it kind of helps reduce the burden of oxidative stress in the skin upon exposure to environmental stressors and there is research in clinical trials looking at topical application of this ingredient for acne there's a study showing that four percent niacinamide is as effective for moderate acne as one percent clindamycin a prescription treatment for acne there's also another study looking at two percent niacinamide gel and showing that that decreases sebum production reducing oiliness and shine so the combination of reducing inflammation and reducing sebum output light likely explains why this is a beneficial ingredient for acne topical niacinamide also can help alleviate and improve some of the visible signs of skin aging it's been demonstrated when applied anywhere from two to four percent uh to help improve the look of fine lines red blotchiness likely because it's anti-inflammatory it also can improve the appearance of sunspots help them fade hyperpigmentation it can help fade and it can help in improving sallow yellow skin which is one of the visible signs of skin aging that you know people don't really ask about much i think they don't realize that that is a component of the visible signs of skin aging they may ask things like complexion improving uh you know how to improve dull skin but part of some of the visible signs of skin aging is this actual yellowing of the skin due to damage of the underlying dermal components from chronic uv exposure kind of gives the skin a yellow appearance combined with a loss of elasticity topical niacinamide can kind of improve some of those some of those visible signs of skin aging so niacinamide may also be helpful for those of you who deal with rosacea because not only does it help calm down redness but it has been shown to improve skin barrier function so for people with rosacea a key issue that they deal with is this this problem with barrier barrier this barrier issue it makes them more sensitive to things that come in contact with the skin irritants that's why a lot of skin care products are irritating to people with rosacea cleansers moisturizers burn and sting niacinamide if tolerated can improve barrier function and make the symptoms of rosacea likely better plus it's anti-inflammatory which also benefits rosacea in terms of the bumps that people with rosacea get so it's a good ingredient for those things however you know like i mentioned at the beginning of the video it's popping up in skincare products left and right at high percentages much greater than what has been examined in these studies and it can be irritating a lot of you guys comment in my videos gosh i cannot do niacinamide uh it burns it stings it causes irritation i do not get along with it and it is in everything these days i hear you there i mean you know it's not right for everyone and not everyone gets along well with it and finding products nowadays that are free of it seems increasingly more of a challenge it's in a lot of cleansers um and it's in you know a lot of serums moisturizers all that to say uh oral nicotinamide is has been shown to be beneficial for people who make a lot of skin cancers at 500 milligrams twice a day it is safe well tolerated however people who have problems with their platelets or people taking carbamazepine should definitely exercise caution with this and you certainly can't overdo it with oral oral nicotinamide get yourself into liver damage that could be quite deadly for you applying it topically to the skin has several benefits provided you tolerate it all right y'all so that is nicotinamide a lot of you guys have been asking me to talk about it for a while now there is another dietary supplement with quite a bit of research to support its use for skin benefit for hyperpigmentation improving sun damage from you know spending time outdoors and it is called polypodium so in the description box as well as on the end slate i'm going to link that video where i talk all about polypodium if you missed that definitely check it out if you were interested in dietary supplements with evidence behind them for their use and skin and skin benefit jeff definitely check that one out but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe i'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

        "transcript": "hey guys Dr Kyle Loveless here today I'm going to talk to you about rosacea one of the comments I got on a psoriasis video is hey can you shoot a video on rosacea so that's where here I am today I'm shooting a video on rosacea and rosacea is actually something we work a lot with in our office and helped a lot of patients with it's very similar in terms of what we're trying to do to do with the body so today you're going to learn what some of the main things that lead to rosacea number one number two I'm going to give you some things to start to change in your diet and supplement wise if you're someone dealing with rosacea maybe you have a friend or family member that is dealing with rosacea and that rosacea you know the red redness of the skin uh it can be very embarrassing because it typically is all over your face and uh just yeah it can be you know life life altering it can affect how much makeup you wear which it can be toxic and worse for your body as well and so yeah rosacea is something that uh we've gotten great results with from dietary changes and supplements and that's it and so I know the medical route is going to be the same like it is with anything else it's corticosteroids you know I had somebody comment um you know that that I'm not a dermatologist and you're right I'm not I wouldn't want to be a dermatologist because their hands are handcuffed unfortunately they've been taught in a system and a model that says okay you have a skin issue let's how do I get rid of this inflammatory skin issue well I can do something reduce inflammation which is a steroid and so they're really handcuffed in that area sometimes they'll do light ultraviolet light and things like that but it's typically just drugs medications and I would rather take the approach of finding the root cause of it I've had so many patients with rosacea and psoriasis and eczema come into our office that go to they've been going to a dermatologist for years not getting any better and then I talk to them we teach them we do testing on them and their eyes are wide open afterwards realizing how did my doctor never tell me this one of our patients actually works for a dermatologist for most of her career and when she heard me start talking about psoriasis and eczema and all this stuff and how I was able to heal my own psoriasis through through diet and through supplements and things like that and she uh and she was like wait psoriasis is a gut problem and she worked for a dermatologist for many years and she didn't know psoriasis is an autoimmune gut issue not a skin issue so that blew me away so yes you're right I'm not a dermatologist and I I don't want to be and I would highly recommend if you have skin issues and you want more than just covering up the the treat the area so you feel better in the moment but you want to get to the root cause because eczema psoriasis rosacea these are underlying health issues that affect everything they can lead to heart disease you can lead to other health issues as well so all right rosacea so first thing I want to talk about with rosacea is like many other skin issues it does has shown to go back to the GI tract one of the main things that I found the research on and I actually just didn't even realize this until I started researching more in depth I've always you know said okay this is a gut issue we understand that we're working on the gut but H pylori is actually something that they find for a lot of people and so this helicobacter pylori is a bacteria in the digestive system when we don't have enough stomach acid it builds up in our GI tract creates ulcers and other you know gut issues and it's very common with people with rosacea and so I want to address that as well and saying okay we got to get your stomach acid up and we need to address the helicobacter as well with certain supplements but this study here is in journal physiological pharmacology and what drives me crazy is all the studies I've learned and read and done these are medical studies and so your dermatologist should be reading them as well and addressing for you as well but what they found when they went through some of these this study with helicobacter is number one rosacea is a disorder in various gastrointestinal symptoms closely related to gastritis so inflamed gut the eradication of H pylori leads to a dramatic Improvement of symptoms of rosacea and reduction in related gastrointestinal symptoms cool a gastritis hypergastrinemia and gastric acid secretion okay so when we get your stomach acid in a good place you get your H pylori under control and then you work on other stuff with the digestive system to get rid of inflammation restore the microbiome that's really when you're you're going to see the rosacea change now that sounds great and sounds simple it's not it takes work it takes dietary changes because if you're still beating up your gut it's not going to start producing acid properly it takes really making bigger changes typically things like antibiotic use over the years poor diet what else chemicals other medications high high levels of stress will affect our stomach acid production those are the things that lead to this okay rosacea could be considered as one of the major extra gastric symptoms of H pylori infection probably mated by the H pylor related cytotoxins and cytokines so there you go H pylori is one of the main things that can cause it and so I'm actually glad I'm doing this video because I learned that it mostly just uh it's still working on the gut and that's what we're always doing the next thing I I want to bring up here is they've also showed deficiency in pancreatic enzymes and other digestive enzymes with rosacea again going back to the GI tract so if I look at that and I say okay we get we've got digestive enzymes we got H pylori what else is there and there's some mineral deficiencies also that they've shown with rosacea which makes sense if you have a gut issue you're not going to absorb minerals as well if you have a gut issue you're probably highly stressed so your body is going to be deficient in minerals if you have a gut issue you probably had a poor diet and a lot of antibiotic use and possibly even other medications so that all makes sense so here what do you do about it okay here's how here's how you do it number one you follow a non-inflammatory diet go ahead and go back to I know this is about psoriasis that I'm telling you but not rosacea but go back to the video I did on psoriasis the top five foods to remove for psoriasis that's the same thing I'm going to recommend you do with rosacea so make sure you go back and watch that video so that's the dietary change I put in the Good Foods your grass-fed organic free-range animals animals raise the way they're supposed to be raised okay cows eat grass and eat green things they don't have antibiotics and hormones chickens Rome and they eat you know seeds and bugs things like that duck eggs are very effective for this kind of stuff because it helps the minerals and nutrient deficiencies and then eat cruciferous vegetables you're high when it comes to vegetables like to the big bang for your buck so the the broccoli the Brussels sprouts the you know the cauliflowers the broccoli Sprouts things like that very effective for things like this okay so you're getting your high nutrient value add some good probiotic type foods in there like before your meal try some sauerkraut or maybe some kimchi before you eat and then also before your meal I want you to take digestive enzymes something with lipase in it they've shown deficiencies in lipase with rosacea so something with lipase or even get yourself a pancreatic enzyme that you can take before your meals I I would go ahead because also a gallbladder issues can lead to this so I would go ahead and take a bile salt so tadka bile salts so you have digestive enzymes tadka bile salts and then betaine HCL okay good possibility that you're having stomach acid issues so we're going to take beta and HCL to help your stomach acid digestive enzymes to help you break down that food bile salts to help you break down the fat so you can get your vitamin A your vitamin D E and K your fat soluble vitamins okay so those three things right there is your starting point supplements the next two things I'm going to rec the next thing I'm going to recommend is a supplement to help your good a good fatty acid levels so something like cod liver oil for your EPA DHA or any kind of good fish oil is going to be the next step just overall autoimmune responses and immune system issues in general next on here and the minerals okay so get yourself a good trace mixed Trace mineral mix or a multivitamin you're going to want stuff like copper you're going to want the things like folic acid B vitamins in there and then so the mixed multi mineral with your zinc your copper things like that B vitamin complex and then the final thing is nicotimide okay and we'll have that written down there but nicotiamide is also something that's been shown very effective in deficiency with rosacea okay so to repeat we got stomach acid HCL we're going to take butane HCL you're going to take a digestive enzymes with your meals you're going to take pancreatic enzymes with your meals to hudco bile salts okay fish oil some sort of omega-3 fatty acid get a good quality fish oil and then you're going to do a multi-mineral cool and make sure this tray smells like copper and Boron and things like that in there as well do those things non-inflammatory diet those supplements right there and do this for a period of time don't do it for two weeks don't do it for a month and say it didn't work follow that for a period of time if you're going for about two months and you're doing this and nothing has changed you need to investigate more the next step is testing to see maybe it's food allergies maybe you need to remove certain foods that are creating inflammation in your gut maybe you need to look at your stool and see what's happening in your digestive system maybe it's more than H pylori as an infection or tons of yeast buildup could be a lot of different stuff okay but the first step is what I just said there okay so hopefully that was helpful for rosacea hey in the links below make sure

        "transcript": "if you have ocular rosacea\u00a0\nor even just regular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 this video is for you. Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "published_at": "2018-08-15T23:56:10Z",
        "transcript": "[Music] hi beauties welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to talk about a sensitive topic that I feel like most people suffer with one or the other and that is rosacea and acne for those that don't know mean it's your first time tuning in I am a licensed aesthetician and makeup artist I work out in the field right now I work and train other estheticians I work with doctor's offices when I did work as an aesthetician I worked at Vera Bella Skin Therapy in Beverly Hills and I did work with a lot of high-profile clientele we had you know actors and actresses and models coming in so I really did work on skin type where people my clients needed to keep their skin constantly camera-ready and one of the main concerns that people would come in for is you know struggling with acne or struggling with breakouts are struggling with rosacea so I want to talk a little bit about what are those two things and what does it come from and ultimately and interesting and not interestingly enough both are signifiers of bacteria and a lot of it is especially with rosacea when you get those like the redness in the skin that's bacteria in our skin where our skin can't naturally detoxify that bacteria and the same thing with acne some people get acne because whatever reason they have oily skin they have bacteria in their skin that their skin can't naturally digest so it's really important just as topical product is bit really really important but it is just as important to treat ourselves from the inside and I think and I'm really excited to see this coming out a lot more people are paying attention to that in the industry because just like diet and exercise you cannot have one without the other I'm not going to go to the gym and workout five times a week and then be eating hamburgers and pizza every night same thing goes if you're struggling and you have a skin concern you need to treat yourself from the inside having a healthy diet taking the right vitamins and supplements as having the the right topical products so with that said I'm gonna focus today on some internal supplements that I really recommend to help treat signs of acne and bacteria so with that said just going a little bit more into like the the science behind things when you have tend to have acne rosacea that means you're more acidic inside and you need to bring your body to more of an alkaline state so a lot of and what I've noticed it's trending a lot is the alkaline waters which is super healthy I recommend if you can everyone drink it if you can't I know there's there's filters you can buy for a fee of like a Brita filter but there's different filters that you can get to purify your own water to make it an alkaline water because it is expensive to have it delivered but anyways long story short acne rosacea your tend to be acidic and you need to bring your body to more of an alkaline state so a couple of ways that you can do that is not only through your your diet there's specific foods that you can eat which I'll talk about in a second but I really want to get into the supplements that I'm using for internal use I've treated a lot of clients and recommended that they get on these these things and it's really really helped them and they've seen an impact in their skin before I talked about that one quick thing I want to mention is a lot of times you might go to the doctor or dermatologist and they immediately want to put you on an antibiotic but when you think about it antibiotics kill bacteria and that is not always good it'll kill not only the bad bacteria but the good bacteria and that's what we need ultimately you have to have a healthy gut because everything comes out through the skin and that is the body's way of letting us know that something is wrong and something is happening in inside so we need to keep our gut really healthy and really clean so a couple of things I do and take on a daily is I take probiotics these help to deliver good bacteria into the gut so this is I actually went to see an internist I think they sell this out Whole Foods but the brand is a naturals I'll link it below if I can find it online but it's a really great pair of probiotic and I actually keep this one in the refrigerator another thing I take on the daily that helps to keep your body this is an alkaline vitamin it is a mineral I take zinc daily and this is just kind of a Clark's brand it's a health food store I take zinc every day I take omega-3 fatty acids I take these every day these will help to bring your body down to an alkaline level I take every day and they say and I take the liquid forms because I use this for so many other things but I know they also have this in a in a vitamin form as well but I take the [Music] apple cider vinegar a teaspoon of this every day it's actually better to probably have more than that but you want to make sure that it is raw unfiltered and with the mother with the mother means that that it has the the bacteria I'm sorry the bacteria the enzymes in there and we want those good enzymes in there to kill any harmful bacteria and bring the body again to an alkaline state and you'll know that it's with the mother when you'll see kind of the chunks in the very bottom it's kind of hard to see on camera but it's like a little chunky at the bottom and you just want to mix that up and I take a teaspoon of this every day and lastly if there is one thing that if you could just if you're really bad with taking vitamins one thing that is a must and if you have to start with one thing it is chlorophyll this is literally and this is in a liquid form one of the most healthiest things that you can do for yourself I got this in a mint flavor just kind of a PSA this is like the most disgusting tasting thing you're ever gonna taste it's really hard to swallow I got it in the mint formula it makes it a little bit better sometimes I mix it in with juices I'm not sure if that's the best I think it's really to be drink drink with water but I do sometimes even to put a juice in there because it it's a really strong flavor but I drink it superfast and I just get it done with it's like ripping off a band-aid but the benefits of chlorophyll and what this do this is a blood Builder it helps to rebuild the red blood cells not only that what chlorophyll will do you could be taking like all the vitamins and minerals in the world and a lot of times if your body isn't in the right pH balance or a good healthy alkaline state they will not absorb so it's kind of going to waste chlorophyll allows your body to absorb those vitamins and minerals that you're taking it helps with you know I have some notes here but I know it helps with like the blood building oh and this is how I originally got on it years ago I was actually anemic as a child so it really helps with and if you have fatigue or anemia it helps with that because it helps to build up the blood cells it speeds recovery from illness unlike a little home remedy it's actually really great if you have a sore throat you can gargle a little bit of chlorophyll and it helps to kind of you know even kill that bacteria that's something new I just I just learned about that I was not aware of that little point there and then a little fun fact is one 8 ounce glass of water with chlorophyll equals three glasses of water so if you're somebody who doesn't in take a lot of water throughout the day please start taking chlorophyll because one 8 ounce glass of that is equal to 3 glasses of water so that's that's pretty incredible so some foods that want to talk about because not only are those vitamins and minerals important let's talk about food and diet and there's plenty of places that you can find this online where you can find foods that are more acidic and more alkaline so if you're trying to get your body into more of an alkaline States alkaline state some great foods for that are bananas avocados lentils quinoa your greens those are really really alkaline foods great to start implementing into your diet things that are acidic and was actually surprising because when you think acidic you just I naturally think of like you know lemons and oranges and things that are fruit but actually meat dairy and gluten are some of your top acidic foods and the top contenders that will cause acne in the skin and a lot of times it could because you have a food intolerance and you might want to get allergy tested but without a doubt any time I would tell a client start with one eliminate all dairy see if there's a difference in your skin or eliminate all gluten see if there's a difference in your skin try to go to more of a vegetarian diet and eliminate meat and without a doubt it would always make such a difference because usually they were intolerant but those are acidic those are foods that will cause and are known to cause some of the reasons why people get acne in their skin so you know those are just a couple of things I do things that work for me really work for some of my clients I would love to hear if you're doing anything I would please share your feedback and of course if you like this video please make sure to LIKE and subscribe if there's anything you want to hear me talk about any topics any product reviews please let me know I know there's so many more videos that are gonna be coming up I'm super excited to share everything with you and I can't wait to see you next time [Music]",

rosacea is really really really topic that was one of the most painful topics that i want to share with all of you and i had the acne actually to get rid of acne which was much much easier rosacea is considered autoimmune disorder if you're going to go to an endocrinologist and they're going to tell you that rosacea it is actually autoimmune disorder so you know autoimmune disorder means you have low immune system and you need to strengthen that so i'm going to share and actually have all the supplements vitamins what i was taking what actually works for me hi everyone who are here right now welcome to my kitchen welcome to my messy uh kitchen i wanted to film actually in the kitchen and because i have all the supplements vitamins and it's a lot it's a lot uh you don't have to do what i did but what worked for me i really want to share with you guys so um love you so much simmer down day spa hey jen hey love beauty is from bangladesh hey tell me guys where are you from over here live i would love to know anyway so let's go to supplements so i have three kind of um options not options like um three niches what helped me supplements lifestyle and skin care so let's start with the supplements very the most probably important is probiotics because if you have h pylori bacteria that's mean that bacteria is a bad bacteria and it's destroying your gut most of the time like 90 percent of the any issues health issues skin issues are related with your gut if you have rosacea you most likely here and there notice that you have a bloating belly aches constipation maybe diarrhea maybe when you eat your tummy aches and you're not in the mood your gut is related to your brain neurotransmitters and actually affects your mood most likely people they have rosacea they're not in the mood they have a bipolar disorder or they have anxiety or they just feel down and it's just like like a like a cycle it's not something cause something is like it's all together so probiotics to me was the biggest like impact and i have um a couple of different um probiotics so one this is kind of pricey but i wanted to share this called uh hmf bifida powder actually with this one i do enemas and also um take internally it's really really great all the lists gonna be down below under this video so you you can check it out i highly highly highly recommend do not use the same probiotics all the time rotate because your gut is gonna get used to and you wanna you wanna use something that is always consistently like new to your gut you can come back once you're done you can come back to this again like in a year but the meanwhile so these are really really really important you can do your research then i have candidates i notice sometimes i have a yeast infections or uti which is also can be related with h pylori bacteria so this is a great candidate that it works actually for both for bad bacteria and for yeast infections if you have if you tend to have everything is related your damaged gut flora can affect absolutely any issue in your healthy heart then i have a premier probiotic caps these are incredible what probiotics do they basically are good bacteria that nourishes your damaged gut flora you have a damaged gut flora because you just simply don't have enough good bacteria to fight so when you send those good bacteria to your gut they are able to fight the bad bacteria and have this balance basically we all have bad and good bacterias but bad bacteria overgrowth diminishes kind of good bacteria and we are like this and the more damage gut flora you have the more um bad bacteria are gonna grow uh less good bacteria gonna have so basically probiotics are a good bacteria that we need you need to start with probiotics immediately tomorrow then neck neck is this guy it is amazing because neck actually replenishes glutathione levels in the body and glutathione is the most powerful the most water thing in our body that actually boosts immune system uh knack stands for an acetyl lc system so i'm using nap all the time i know amazon be discontinued for some reason but some stores they still have a knack get knack right now like for three years for two years in advance until um i kind of have feeling uh eventually these big people gonna discontinue an act because this actually works even for this big word i don't want to say i don't want to say but it starts with the c so knack is really really important to boost our immune system digestive enzymes if you notice that your poop is floating or you have diarrhea or especially if you're constipated and if you eat something and you see food chunks in your poo it is very very important that you need the digestive enzyme absolutely every uh i don't want to say patience because i'm not a doctor by the way this is not medical advice do your own research talk to your own doctor this is what work personally for me i am not a doctor i'm not a nurse i'm not a practitioner this is just what what worked for me what i tested what i did the research you do not have to take this advice at all and by the way if until now you haven't clicked this subscribe button please click subscribe that going to help my channel a lot and i want more people to know what helped with my rosacea so i can help more people all right so digestive enzymes and which one i'm using i have a lot of stuff here so um i also rotate digestive enzymes digestive enzymes that currently i'm using is from optimal looks like that as i mentioned again this all information and links to all the products that i'm mentioning is going to be down below in the description box so all right digestive enzyme then vitamin d and vitamin k strengthens immune system is actually not vitamin it is hormones i it's a hormone i don't know why people name it vitamin but d3 plus k you need that because absolutely every person that has a gut issues has a low stomach acid actually have a low vitamin d if you do the blood test if you have rosacea if you do the blood test i guarantee you will be low in this one so you want to supplement this um vitamin number five natural antibacterial herbal supplements so i do have a couple of to share i also rotate as i mentioned i do not use the same vitamins or supplements all the time i rotate so oregon grape this is number one supplement that you want to have if you have any skin issues so if you have rosacea especially eczema if you have eczema or if you know somebody has eczema this is what you or they need oregon grape helps with many skin conditions nobody's talking about i am talking about you need oregon grape because that helps to replenish gut flora and that affects your skin this is great for rosacea and eczema psoriasis any kind of dermatitis then golden seal you do not want to use um all the time this you can take for 10 days then take 10 days break the same this one use 10 days this 10 days this rotate don't use this all the time it does the same thing both are anti-bacterial antimicrobial herb supplements and then cat's claw this is tincture so i use um this dropper half of the dropper like every third or every fortnight i'm still using it i love it do your own research and then of course we do have january beauty signature um anti-viral antibacterial 12 beautiful herbs over here in this little capsule and um you can check this on my website it's just a few samples that i'm sending to some of you um check it out i do have this on my website okay so this is with antibacterial anti okay the next one is anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory i have those two i have never heard about that my friend who is a naturopathic nutritionist she told me about those two produce and holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] so basically if you have inflammation in your skin you do have inflammation in your gut and these two are anti-inflammatory come from the same company it's called boss med 500 advanced boswellia is a healthy inflammation response and this one is kuramed uh super absorption curcumin curcumin if you know guys it's very very anti-inflammatory this is great if you have any kind of inflammation in your body highly recommend i rotate all of those supplements i know it looks a lot but rotating and investing in your health to prevent actually you can get rid of rosacea this is what happened i'm going to tell you a little bit later by the way stick until the end because at the very very very very end i am going to share two tips that helped me the most what helped me the most that i noticed biggest difference and just stay until then i promise you you'll be like what yeah all right so then it is fish oils you need to have a good quality fish oil first of all if you have a dry skin if you have a sensitive skin if you have a flaky skin eczema rosacea psoriasis you need omegas in your body so fish oil omegas comes from these guys that i'm using and i'm always rotating i am just in love with mercola's products you don't have to like i love it works so much so many comments adhd and anxiety from lithuania currently living okay just i'm reading guys okay love you recommend okay so these are omegas right krill oil and this is herring caviar oil you need omegas in your diet your body is so dry especially if you're using some sort of like a dose antibacterials they most of the time dry out your body you need to notice you need to hydrate another things that i have if you're vegan omegas from flax seeds where is my chia seeds you can get those these are amazing you need to drink this like every day with the shake i just had a shake i put those like this amount of like flax seeds in one shake you need those every day plus they helps with the bowel movement your bowels move faster better for you right and the binders if you for example you using those antibacterial antimicrobial you kill those kind of bacteria microbes you know metals fungi parasites and stuff like this and if you're not pooping consistently if you're not sweating enough which we don't do every day you need to get binders this is my favorite biner gi detox uh bio botanical research incorporation basically it has activated charcoal aloe vera silica apple pectin humic acid it's bind it like basically binds all the bad crap that you have in your body and you sweat it out you shed it out from your body you need binders if you're using all those and you're not using binders don't use binders together with none of those you need to use binders away one and a half hours from anything of those if you're using those in the morning make sure you use those at least two hours after and better if you don't use this with the food so you really really have to be strict i know you're gonna say gin but i'm working nine to five it's kind of hard yes well working nine to five and b being busy and having rosacea is hard right but not having rosacea and taking all those supplements every day is also hard but i choose take those supplements carry it with me all the time no matter where i go if i fly i carry those supplements with me all the freaking time i look like a crazy grandma with a bunch of supplements and vitamins but i take those every day like clearly every day and once a day i have a day when i fast once a month i fast i don't take any of that and i do enema or colonics so think that we're jumping to lifestyle and as you see i see number one enemas so enema and colonics just let's clean this ass why we don't clean our ass i don't know but i was very skeptical before i was introduced into colonics and then i did the colonics one two three sessions and i was like what do you guys do colonics let me know here in the comments in the chat i would like to know if you do colonics and animus hello will be possible to integrate in your video this um i don't know about about subtitles you guys have to figure out i think you can do that going to the settings my grandma had rosation she had these issues with oculars h balar being the major culprit makes sense yeah so animus let me know in the chat if you guys do enemas regularly i do enemas at least at least right now when everything is okay at least once a month when i have a flare-ups when i used to have flare-ups i used to do like once a week enemas are amazing a little bit uncomfortable but they cleanse your ass you cleanse your bowels they cleanse your entire like colon that you can do this naturally when you poop in the restroom and it's funny to talk about that nobody's talking about that but i'm so passionate we need to cleanse the bowels we can't just naturally cleanse the bowel here is a tip that i have if you hate animals you have tried or colonics and you're really really broke you don't have money to do this and you don't have time in the morning one tablespoon of salt with the warm water on the empty stomach right away when you wake up do this three days in a row and on a fourth day you're gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] like crazy i promise to you make sure you don't go to work that day when you do that try on the weekend so um salt eps like not epsom salt is himalayan salt actually from the same i don't have it right now with me but from the same company premier research lab you can find on amazon they have it's called pink himalayan salt it's the best to cleanse your bowel it's gonna work the same when you're gonna drink internally taking your mouth drink it in the morning with the warm water one tablespoon it's gonna be a little bit nasty but it's gonna help you to cleanse everything and you're gonna have light diarrhea so that's gonna help if you don't wanna have enemas see yes i'm talking about [\u00a0__\u00a0] i just took that too okay okay so enemas are very very very very important it cleans your bowels it cleanse the bacteria cleanse h pylori cleanse all the crab that you have in your bowels and you need to cleanse that so uh and then ozone ib i love ozone iv i'm getting ozone iv every single month i'm getting even um i have little let me show you i shouldn't maybe show that but you know what i'm going to show you i have even sometimes when oh my camera is moving this is so cool right so i have a ozone suspiratorys over here when i feel kind of bloated where i feel my digestion is a little bit off i put those in my rectum and it helps me a lot it's funny how people don't understand that our gut it is a mirror and reflection on our face our face is just not the skin our face is a representation of what's happening in your gut where is this book right now i didn't bring this book but book gaps got on psychology syndrome talks about that how god is related to your skin next one from lifestyle acupuncture do acupuncture if you can afford just once a month just do once a month acupuncture it's not expensive and it's so beneficial in chinese medicine everything every organ has their special points on the body and for example when i went when i had rosacea i was doing acupuncture it helped me so much it just regulates balance yin and yang and you know we all have energies we all have this balance acupuncture balances you out this is what was helping to me meditations joe dispenza put in youtube joe dispenza meditation do meditations we need to without addressing nervous system nothing of those white vitamins supplements skin care is not going to work we need to address nervous system meditations help a lot with nervous system you know what helps with nervous system as well we hof breathing go to youtube enter wim hof breathing and do this 11 minute breathing i do this every day almost i've been doing wim hof for like a year right now and helped so much relaxes you you're so in peace you're floating and he did actually study when he was breathing and doing cold showers and he's like he's called iceman he helps with your nervous system to balance your nervous system to strengthen your immune system he was doing crazy experiment they injected the virus in his body and his body like immune system killed all those viruses just because he's not taking like any kind of like vitamins or supplements he's just a normal man but he does cold plunges like cold showers cold baths breathing like he's um he has so many world records for not breathing swimming under the ice like lake and stuff like this he's um incredible crazy man but i learned from him with home breathing and it helps strengthen my immune system my immune system happy my gut is happy and my skin is happy all right and probably the most important that i told you before jumping into skincare which is important but i will say it's funny to say from a me aesthetician and a skincare brand owner that skin care has the least impact in getting rid of rosacea we're gonna get to skincare very quickly but the most important tip that helped me and it is actually the hardest thing to do but i'm so so happy you guys excited to learn about this to know what helped the most in my rosacea journey it is when i quit alcohol nine months today and seven days as i don't drink alcohol and three months and 17 days as i quit coffee if you quit coffee where is the substitute that i wanted to show you guys uh where is that i just had somewhere i don't know where but it's called blend uh dandy blend it is coffee substitute i just i swear to god i had it here oh right here this one if you want to quit coffee then the blend it's something that you want to try tastes just like coffee tastes really really really really good no caffeine it's actually dandy dandelion tea that helps with immune system it helps to replenish your liver will deliver what i want to mention about the skin that any person that has skin issues they have to take oregon grape oregon grape cleanse your liver your liver clean you get better you feel better so coffee and alcohol when i noticed the biggest impact this is what i did experiment i did the experiment when i started like i came back when i got rosacea when i got rosacea i actually was like this is interesting what changed right now why i got rosacea the moment i remember like i came back when i started coffee i started drinking coffee two years ago this is when i started developing rosacea i'm like no that's not true then i quit coffee my rosacea was kind of disappearing then i came back to drinking coffee my rosacea came back so i don't know if that's coincidence i don't know if that's just happened but you know what no alcohol no coffee it's helping me a lot i have more energy right now than before so and quickly about skin care number one skipping morning face wash when you're disrupting all your skin like a protective lipid barrier that's not okay i don't want to go into detail because i have a like um probably like 50 videos on tech talk about skipping morning face wash why it's beneficial by the way if you're not subscribed to my tech talk june amber over there go subscribe i have right now almost 100 000 followers over there which is my biggest uh platform so if you are on tiktok come and subscribe and check out my tik tok account then face face morning face wash no in the morning at night double cleanse then you want to over hydrate instead of over exfoliating you want to over hydrate i brought my favorite hydration cream la roche posay la roche posay lippy car bomb really really great hydrates like crazy link is gonna be down below uh then exfoliating you want to exfoliate what i'm doing only once every three sometimes once every four days i just don't exfoliate my skin my skin when i'm not exfoliating not over washing yes it has some some oil but right now more normal than ever before as you see guys i don't have makeup right now here i might gonna look oily sometimes in some videos and some pictures but i rather be over hydrated and have more oil than super dry and that ages me faster and avoiding toxic irritating and produce that have just bad ingredients like parabens fragrance dyes and stuff like this so you guys know if you're not familiar with me i do have my own natural inorganic skin care brand it's called genomic beauty just wanted to show you my two favorite produce that i have it's a peptide serum it is vitamin c they both have um 98 natural 72 organic ingredients we do not use parabens no fragrance natural have a little bit weird smell but doesn't smell nice because we don't add any fragrance fragrance it's just full of heavy metals like mercury and stuff like this that irritates our skin so clean and natural skincare if you want to check out is gin under beauty and i do have also my favorite rose water spray i can spray on my hair everywhere it's really safe it's non-toxic you don't want you don't want to apply on your skin on your face something that is toxic that is irritating your skin and just wanna do everything all this together don't go like crazy don't be overwhelmed this is like a lot of stuff make sure that you actually just loving yourself first that you like okay this is going to work i'm ready i'm going to do it slow few supplements at the time start meditation with her breathing change like slowly switch all the skin care products start reading labels really when you're gonna start reading labels you're gonna pick just one brand or a couple of products that you like you don't need crazy a lot more amount of produce you just need literally like one or two antioxidants one exfoliating few cleansers like cleansing bomb and cleanser uh protection spf we are launching spf very soon i don't have it with me right now um so just start slowly believe it you can do it i did it i watched so many youtube videos like the people got rid of rosacea most of the time they all talk about how gut affects their skin all right i'm done with the rosacea and now i'm gonna go to the comments so ask me if you want something okay okay please do a video how you cure thyroid problems autoimmunities i do have like three videos how i got rid of hashimoto's thyroiditis you can guys go to my youtube channel and just enter jin amber hashimoto's thyroiditis and i do have a couple of videos how i got rid of that i have never gotten back so i'm amazing it's incredible actually this is one of the reasons why i got rid because i was consistent exercising loving myself meditating making sure i'm addressing my sleep my nervous system supplements vitamins addressing antioxidants glutathione everything you want to boost your immune system and there is many many ways how we can address but also what works for me it might not gonna work for you so you have to really test it test your foods when you eat what do you what do you what do you eat are you eating gluten and gluten is causing you really really bad you know flair up by the way when i was like sick with the hashimoto's with rosacea with all this stuff i was really really not eating gluten no dairy no sugar no sweets nothing at all i quit completely everything sometimes right now i'm eating a little bit yesterday i had gluten and i'm okay but i don't use this every single day but when i was healing this woman i cut everything especially gluten dairy and sugar these are the most inflammatory food that any person want to stop while healing so can i can't sleep naturally what natural medicine helps melatonin malaria root valerian root is really really great check out valerian roots actually they helpful for a sleep can i go to america to study with the english level b2 um i have their rest easy tincture by 2911 wellness on sm it's amazing and enhanced natural sleep okay okay you guys can help one another in the comments this is amazing i think sugar is triggered also yes absolutely sugar is a big big big big trigger you wanna avoid sugar and if you're really craving for the sweets get the banana get get grapefruit grapefruit is really really amazing what i'm doing lately actually great for grapefruit with garlic is anti-inflammatory and this actually mask the taste of the garlic i put them together i chop it off and then i drink juice on the top sometimes i add a little bit of vinegar which is helping also with stomach acid those are amazing if you're in the budget if you can buy anything like you can't do anything what i just told you at least get this and do daily at least every other day it's gonna help you at some point a little bit uh okay oh my gosh yes i love dandy blend so much so easy to taste yes how long does it take to get off old stretch marks with the body

and\u00a0\ni went to the dermatologist and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 was like yeah you have rosacea and i just remember\u00a0\nthem telling me that and i was like oh my gosh\u00a0\u00a0 like i've you know seen people with rosacea i've\u00a0\nheard all about it and i never thought it would\u00a0\u00a0 you know hit me and hit my skin but i was starting\u00a0\nto see all these things and i just remember being\u00a0\u00a0 like oh my gosh like no this cannot be happening\u00a0\nand i went to a couple different dermatologists\u00a0\u00a0 this was all the way back when i was in atlanta um\u00a0\nand they also the same thing they're like yes it's\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea there's nothing you can do about it it's\u00a0\nincurable you just have to manage it and they all\u00a0\u00a0 wanted to throw like medication and antibiotics\u00a0\nat me and at the time like i said i honestly had\u00a0\u00a0 no idea what to do so i started taking antibiotics\u00a0\nand yeah i mean it controlled it to somewhat and\u00a0\u00a0 it helped it clear my skin somewhat but you can't\u00a0\nstay on antibiotics long and i'm going to even\u00a0\u00a0 share with you why it's the worst idea to take\u00a0\nantibiotics if you have rosacea i'm going to share\u00a0\u00a0 that with you shortly but to make a long story\u00a0\nshort when you go to a dermatologist that's all\u00a0\u00a0 they want to do is they want to throw prescription\u00a0\nmedications at you prescription topical products\u00a0\u00a0 at you and prescription you know like antibiotics\u00a0\nand internal prescriptions which that so as i\u00a0\u00a0 continued on and you know my whole little journey\u00a0\nwith this i was just like no like something\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't doesn't seem right there's no way this is\u00a0\nyou know incurable you know i had dermatologists\u00a0\u00a0 tell me that it was like mites on my skin and just\u00a0\nlike dermatologists don't even know why people get\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea like i i went to so many different doctors\u00a0\nand they all said the same thing they're like yeah\u00a0\u00a0 we don't really know what causes rosacea but we do\u00a0\nknow that it's a skin condition that you just have\u00a0\u00a0 to live with and it's you there's no cure and\u00a0\ni was like no like i'm not gonna deal with this\u00a0\u00a0 like i'm not gonna be on medications for the rest\u00a0\nof my life for skin issues like no like there's\u00a0\u00a0 got to be something to this so i really really\u00a0\nstarted researching and i remember laying in bed\u00a0\u00a0 at all hours of the night and just researching\u00a0\nresearching what other people have done and\u00a0\u00a0 researching um just everything that i could figure\u00a0\nout about this skin condition which actually led\u00a0\u00a0 me to osmosis and this was like i said like six or\u00a0\nseven years ago osmosis was like a tiny company no\u00a0\u00a0 one heard of osmosis i reached out to the company\u00a0\nbecause i read a lot of good things about them\u00a0\u00a0 on just like little blogs here and there and i\u00a0\nread like little like rosacea blogs and people\u00a0\u00a0 were saying how it really you know this brand was\u00a0\nlike the one brand that really helped their skin\u00a0\u00a0 and they were like these tiny little blogs that i\u00a0\nhad to like dig through so much research to find\u00a0\u00a0 because i said i've never heard of osmosis no\u00a0\none did back then so i reached out to osmosis\u00a0\u00a0 and become became started to become you know\u00a0\nfriends with ben johnson ben johnson he's been\u00a0\u00a0 on my channel now for years he's a really good\u00a0\nfriend of mine now but i reached out to him and i\u00a0\u00a0 remember having conversations with him about like\u00a0\nmy skin in particular and all kinds of stuff again\u00a0\u00a0 long story short ben johnson the formulator of\u00a0\nosmosis skincare is very holistic and he's the one\u00a0\u00a0 that put into my mind he's like no brianna like\u00a0\nyou're going about things the wrong way rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is internal it's like an internal issue that you\u00a0\nhave to fix from the inside out and everything\u00a0\u00a0 clicked everything he said made so much sense\u00a0\nso i started taking his advice and everything\u00a0\u00a0 in my life just completely turned around what i\u00a0\nlearned is that rosacea is an internal imbalance\u00a0\u00a0 it's gut health it is all about gut health and\u00a0\ninflammation in your gut and all of that and\u00a0\u00a0 once you have that figured out you can clear your\u00a0\nskin and that is not even just with rosacea it is\u00a0\u00a0 with acne it's with so many other skin conditions\u00a0\nmy son is 14 and was getting really bad acne we\u00a0\u00a0 completely changed around his diet put him on the\u00a0\nright supplements and he has really clear skin now\u00a0\u00a0 you can clear a skin condition including rosacea\u00a0\nit is not an incurable skin condition you can cure\u00a0\u00a0 it with internal balance so basically what's going\u00a0\non is you know you don't just wake up with rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 one morning it's an ongoing thing that's happening\u00a0\nin your body and the funny thing is i've always\u00a0\u00a0 had like like gut issues and digestion issues and\u00a0\nall of that bloating i would get like really bad\u00a0\u00a0 stomach aches sometimes and you know we're so busy\u00a0\nin our daily lives you don't even like really stop\u00a0\u00a0 to listen to your body your body is always telling\u00a0\nyou something and your skin is a representation\u00a0\u00a0 of what's going on in your body your skin is\u00a0\na representation of the health that's going\u00a0\u00a0 on inside your body and once you really begin\u00a0\nto learn that and begin to listen to your body\u00a0\u00a0 it all makes sense so rosacea stems from your gut\u00a0\nand like i said it's not something you just wake\u00a0\u00a0 up with one day and you're like oh crap like\u00a0\ni have rosacea now it doesn't happen like that\u00a0\u00a0 it's something that you know takes a while to\u00a0\nreally start to come out in your skin it's you\u00a0\u00a0 know all these little digestion issues it's your\u00a0\ngut health it's like you know food intolerances\u00a0\u00a0 are a big thing i actually took myself off dairy\u00a0\nand gluten to begin my whole journey with and that\u00a0\u00a0 helped a lot because i did find out i had um\u00a0\nintolerances to both gluten and dairy i'll get\u00a0\u00a0 into all that as well but once you really start\u00a0\nto realize that rosacea stems from the inside\u00a0\u00a0 and it's the inflammation it's the toxins that are\u00a0\nbuilding up within your gut and your digestion and\u00a0\u00a0 you know all of that once you figure that\u00a0\nout you can clear your skin and that is so\u00a0\u00a0 key so let's talk about the three steps that you\u00a0\nneed to take to cure your rosacea like cure your\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea for good step number one is diet now i\u00a0\npersonally went to a functional medicine doctor\u00a0\u00a0 um there was a place in atlanta that i went to\u00a0\na functional medicine like a holistic doctor\u00a0\u00a0 and it completely changed my life like i got\u00a0\nlike blood work done i got all of these you\u00a0\u00a0 know food intolerances done but what i really\u00a0\nlearned and it's the exact same thing that i\u00a0\u00a0 learned from talking to dr ben johnson is that\u00a0\nyour body can heal itself like i said everything\u00a0\u00a0 that's like going on in your body it will come\u00a0\nout on your skin if you have toxins building up\u00a0\u00a0 if you have inflammation it's going to come out\u00a0\non your skin and honestly going to a functional\u00a0\u00a0 medicine doctor is just so like eye opening and\u00a0\ni love it like i still go to a functional doctor\u00a0\u00a0 today just to keep up with like my blood work and\u00a0\njust to see how things are going you know like\u00a0\u00a0 i go to a normal like physicals you know i go to\u00a0\nmy normal women's physical doctors and stuff but i\u00a0\u00a0 always go to my functional medicine doctor for\u00a0\nlike the blood work and they just dive into so\u00a0\u00a0 much and they just have such a different approach\u00a0\nto healing the body in a different approach to to\u00a0\u00a0 medicine because i think i think we as like humans\u00a0\nwe are bombarded with like prescriptions upon\u00a0\u00a0 prescriptions upon prescriptions when our bodies\u00a0\nare meant to heal themselves and our bodies are\u00a0\u00a0 showing signs of distress all the time but we just\u00a0\nhave to take the time to listen to what they are\u00a0\u00a0 and rosacea acne it's a sign that something is off\u00a0\nin your body and you have to take that as a sign\u00a0\u00a0 that something's going on you know it's not just\u00a0\na skin condition that pops up it's not something\u00a0\u00a0 that just happens that's you know mites on\u00a0\nyour skin that's incurable no it is a sign\u00a0\u00a0 from inside your body like hey something's going\u00a0\non here you guys like something's not you know in\u00a0\u00a0 balance something's going on like look internal\u00a0\nwhich i think is amazing i think it's so awesome\u00a0\u00a0 that our bodies do that so step number one like\u00a0\ni was saying is diet i really went hardcore into\u00a0\u00a0 diet at this time because i really really wanted\u00a0\nto take out everything that i could to balance out\u00a0\u00a0 issues you know that i was having so\u00a0\ni took out the gluten i took out dairy\u00a0\u00a0 which the functional medicine doctor and dr ben\u00a0\njohnson both said those two things are a huge\u00a0\u00a0 cause for so many people and skin conditions so i\u00a0\ntook those out of my diet completely and i i eat\u00a0\u00a0 clean like i still eat really clean and healthy\u00a0\nto this day but i made sure like back then i\u00a0\u00a0 just didn't cheat at all i just kept everything\u00a0\ngluten free dairy free and just ate very clean\u00a0\u00a0 and i can tell you that made a big difference\u00a0\nreally look at your diet take out you know\u00a0\u00a0 take out the dairy take out the gluten you can\u00a0\nlive without those two i promise you both of those\u00a0\u00a0 create such inflammation within our bodies that\u00a0\nit comes out in your skin and again it's something\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't see overnight you're not going to\u00a0\njust eat a piece of pizza and then tomorrow have\u00a0\u00a0 you know acne or rosacea it doesn't work like that\u00a0\nit takes a long time for your body to build up\u00a0\u00a0 all that inflammation and you know really throw\u00a0\noff your gut health it's not an overnight thing\u00a0\u00a0 but once you start to take those you know those\u00a0\nfactors out of your diet your body from the inside\u00a0\u00a0 will really start to heal and repair itself second\u00a0\nand this is a huge one for me is supplements\u00a0\u00a0 i really did not take any supplements back in\u00a0\nthe day and if you're familiar with me and my\u00a0\u00a0 channel now i talk about supplements all the time\u00a0\nbecause they changed my life they changed my skin\u00a0\u00a0 supplements are key so even with my son\u00a0\nlike i said he's 14 was dealing with acne\u00a0\u00a0 i put him on certain supplements and\u00a0\nit's what really really cleared his skin\u00a0\u00a0 so you can slap all the different skincare\u00a0\nproducts on that you want but if you're not\u00a0\u00a0 fixing internal issues you're never going to\u00a0\nhave the most beautiful perfect skin because\u00a0\u00a0 you're not you're always be playing catch up\u00a0\nwith what's going on internally you have to have\u00a0\u00a0 internal balance and then use your topical skin\u00a0\ncare products as like icing on the cake and\u00a0\u00a0 they both work together to create like amazing\u00a0\nbeautiful healthy skin so supplements to me are\u00a0\u00a0 like no joke i take my supplements every single\u00a0\nday i take a lot of supplements um but honestly\u00a0\u00a0 it's necessary because we are getting we're eating\u00a0\nfood that's you know grown in certain ways there's\u00a0\u00a0 all these like our food is not like real food\u00a0\nlike it was back in the long time ago days you\u00a0\u00a0 know like we're growing food and soils that have\u00a0\nall these like chemicals and just everything is so\u00a0\u00a0 different with our foods that our bodies aren't\u00a0\ngetting the nutrients that that they need it's\u00a0\u00a0 creating toxins and and you know imbalances within\u00a0\nour gut and that's what leads to a lot of people\u00a0\u00a0 having skin conditions skin conditions are on the\u00a0\nrise because of the foods we eat because we're not\u00a0\u00a0 really supplementing and taking care of our gut\u00a0\nand our health internally so supplements are key\u00a0\u00a0 and the key supplements that you really really\u00a0\nwant to look for i'm going to share with you\u00a0\u00a0 exactly what i recommend to take if you have\u00a0\nrosacea because these will change your life\u00a0\u00a0 the first one that i'm going to talk about is\u00a0\nthis because this is a must you guys it's the\u00a0\u00a0 osmosis skin clarifier 10 day blemish cleanse\u00a0\nso i always joke with ben i'm like it shouldn't\u00a0\u00a0 really be called blemish cleanse because it's\u00a0\nhonestly good for all skin types no matter even\u00a0\u00a0 if you have a skin condition or not it's so good\u00a0\nthough for acne and rosacea people like it really\u00a0\u00a0 clears your skin so it's a 10-day cleanse and what\u00a0\nthis does is it pulls every like toxin and gunk\u00a0\u00a0 out of your like track like your digestion and\u00a0\nyour gut which is that's where skin conditions\u00a0\u00a0 start from its digestion and its gut health so\u00a0\nthis cleanse i mean it doesn't make you like\u00a0\u00a0 run to the bathroom every five seconds or anything\u00a0\nthere's no like weird side effects like that\u00a0\u00a0 at all but you will notice it in your skin so\u00a0\nit's a 10 day cleanse now if you have rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 i highly suggest three back-to-back cleanses if\u00a0\nyou're just starting out with like you know curing\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea you need three of these back-to-back\u00a0\nso it's gonna be 30 days of taking eight pills in\u00a0\u00a0 the morning and eight pills at night but it\u00a0\nis worth it because this will save your skin\u00a0\u00a0 this is the first step to really really just\u00a0\ncleaning out all the gunk that has been built\u00a0\u00a0 up in your digestion and in your gut and there's\u00a0\nnothing like this on the market this is actually\u00a0\u00a0 like a mucus cleanse basically because again so\u00a0\nmany foods that we eat our bodies are creating you\u00a0\u00a0 know its own mucus all the time but so much like\u00a0\nyou know dairy and just foods that we eat actually\u00a0\u00a0 cause more mucus in our bodies and a lot of times\u00a0\nmucus built up in your body is a form of like\u00a0\u00a0 like inflammation too so um it you have like\u00a0\na build up of mucus and it's always lining our\u00a0\u00a0 digestion in our gut and this is cleans it out\u00a0\nlike this is like we'll clean out all of that\u00a0\u00a0 so it's a must it's the very very first step to\u00a0\ngetting clear skin if you have rosacea now for me\u00a0\u00a0 personally i do still take this a hundred percent\u00a0\ni take this like every other month but i usually\u00a0\u00a0 only do one to two back to back instead of the\u00a0\nthree but again if you're just starting out with\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea and you really wanna work to clear it\u00a0\nyou're gonna wanna start with the highest dose\u00a0\u00a0 which is three back-to-back cleanses then these\u00a0\nare the other ones that i highly suggest you guys\u00a0\u00a0 the truth treatments blemish repair complex\u00a0\namazing for rosacea amazing for acne my son\u00a0\u00a0 takes this every single day and it really\u00a0\nreally helps his skin as well i take this\u00a0\u00a0 every single day i will never be without this\u00a0\nthis is a supplement that i take every day\u00a0\u00a0 whereas this you know skin cleanse is more of like\u00a0\na cleanse and i take that cleanse like every other\u00a0\u00a0 month or so just to really clean out everything\u00a0\nand to keep all the gum buildup all of that\u00a0\u00a0 this is more along the lines of like the perfect\u00a0\ningredients that your skin needs to stay healthy\u00a0\u00a0 i mean this has your vitamin a it's got all your\u00a0\ndifferent vitamin b's vitamin d3 it has chromium\u00a0\u00a0 selenium copper zinc nack nac like truly\u00a0\ntruly everything that your skin needs to stay\u00a0\u00a0 balanced to have clear amazing skin so whether\u00a0\nyou have acne rather you have rosacea this is a\u00a0\u00a0 supplement that you have to take daily because it\u00a0\nwill 100 100 help your skin that's a must as well\u00a0\u00a0 as the truth treatments the fulvic cellular\u00a0\nrepair complex so this is literally all your\u00a0\u00a0 minerals your nutrients it's got fulvic acid but\u00a0\nit's got so much like necessary like amino acids\u00a0\u00a0 and nutrients that your body cannot get it can't\u00a0\nabsorb from the foods that we eat on a daily basis\u00a0\u00a0 and this makes a huge difference with like\u00a0\nbringing down the redness and the inflammation in\u00a0\u00a0 your skin it's amazing this is definitely one that\u00a0\nyou want to be taking every single day as well and\u00a0\u00a0 then these two are a must now i have been taking\u00a0\nprobiotics forever ever since i started my like\u00a0\u00a0 supplement journey probiotic daily is a must for\u00a0\ngut health you have to be a probiotic prebiotic\u00a0\u00a0 absolute must now i've gone through\u00a0\nso many in the past however many years\u00a0\u00a0 this is the one i'm using right now and i swear\u00a0\nthere is no probiotic slash prebiotic better\u00a0\u00a0 than this one i have felt such a difference\u00a0\nsince being on this i've been taking this for\u00a0\u00a0 maybe like three to four months now and it's\u00a0\ninsane i feel so good like i always have to\u00a0\u00a0 deal with like bloating and digestion issues\u00a0\nall of that and ever since i started taking this\u00a0\u00a0 there's none of that i take this before bed and\u00a0\ni literally like wake up i have like my stomach's\u00a0\u00a0 flat not bloated there's so many times like i will\u00a0\neat like crappy food that i know i shouldn't be\u00a0\u00a0 eating for dinner or something and i know like\u00a0\nhalf the time i would wake up and just be like\u00a0\u00a0 bloated and gross afterwards not with this like\u00a0\nthere's been none of that since i've been taking\u00a0\u00a0 this and it just i feel like light inside like\u00a0\ni feel good and it also really controls like\u00a0\u00a0 being regular if you know what i mean a lot of\u00a0\npeople who have digestion issues and gut issues\u00a0\u00a0 that is a big thing and that is a huge thing\u00a0\nfor skin issues you have to like keep everything\u00a0\u00a0 moving so that nothing's like building up\u00a0\nand not gonna be coming out on your skin\u00a0\u00a0 toxins are always going to find a way to come out\u00a0\non your skin a prebiotic probiotic is a must and\u00a0\u00a0 this is something i will never be without as well\u00a0\nand honestly the symbiotica probiotic this is the\u00a0\u00a0 best thing for gut health probiotic wise ever\u00a0\nso this is a must anyone everyone should be on a\u00a0\u00a0 probiotic but if you have acne if you have rosacea\u00a0\nthat means you are struggling with gut health\u00a0\u00a0 and this is needed daily and the other thing that\u00a0\ni want to mention is the osmosis digestive support\u00a0\u00a0 enzymes the digestive enzymes they actually come\u00a0\nin a different packaging now i have some backups\u00a0\u00a0 of the old packaging but the digestive enzymes\u00a0\nby osmosis are amazing the best digestive enzymes\u00a0\u00a0 i've ever used you can take one or two of these\u00a0\nbefore every meal and it just helps your body\u00a0\u00a0 to digest so you start losing like your natural\u00a0\nenzymes to break up food you lose them as you get\u00a0\u00a0 older so that's why you notice a lot more like\u00a0\ndigestion issues and gut issues and bloating as\u00a0\u00a0 you get older so a lot of times it's so necessary\u00a0\nto supplement with the right enzymes to really\u00a0\u00a0 help break down that food and to really help your\u00a0\nbody absorb the nutrients that it's that it's you\u00a0\u00a0 know taking in if you don't you're like losing\u00a0\nthem or it's building up in like toxin waste\u00a0\u00a0 in your body and stuff so digestive enzymes are\u00a0\ndefinitely you know i would say along the lines\u00a0\u00a0 of everything i take here it's a must as well i\u00a0\ndo think these core ones that i talked about first\u00a0\u00a0 are your most key components but if you have the\u00a0\nextra time or the extra want for digestive enzymes\u00a0\u00a0 they definitely do make a difference you will\u00a0\ndefinitely notice a difference and just taking\u00a0\u00a0 this before every meal really really helps so\u00a0\nthat is another key factor so we have number one\u00a0\u00a0 really look at your diet number two you have\u00a0\nto supplement you have to get your gut health\u00a0\u00a0 in check you have to be on the right supplements\u00a0\nit's going to make a huge difference for your skin\u00a0\u00a0 number one in my book at this point in my skin\u00a0\njourney supplements is the key for me if i get off\u00a0\u00a0 my supplements i notice a difference with my skin\u00a0\nto this day because stuff starts to not work and i\u00a0\u00a0 get you know off balance internally supplements\u00a0\nare that that important all right so step three\u00a0\u00a0 final step that you really need to take to cure\u00a0\nyour rosacea is again your topical skin care\u00a0\u00a0 so we start with the internal and then it does\u00a0\nmatter you know what skincare you use topically\u00a0\u00a0 and again that is how i discovered osmosis way\u00a0\nback in the day before anyone knew of osmosis um\u00a0\u00a0 i love this brand to this day i've been using this\u00a0\nbrand for honestly like six or seven years now\u00a0\u00a0 whenever i discover them which if you've been with\u00a0\nmy channel for a long time you remember that and\u00a0\u00a0 i think it was probably about seven years ago\u00a0\nthat is how long i've used this brand and it's\u00a0\u00a0 amazing not only do i love like the osmosis\u00a0\napproach because everything's more holistic\u00a0\u00a0 ben johnson is like ahead of his time he's\u00a0\nbeen using formulations and ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 that are only now like people are like oh yeah\u00a0\nlike retinaldehyde that's like a amazing form\u00a0\u00a0 of vitamin a like there's a lot of like his\u00a0\ningredients that are only now people are like\u00a0\u00a0 oh i'm starting to hear about this ingredient\u00a0\nthey've been in osmosis for years and their\u00a0\u00a0 products work so beyond amazing because of it um\u00a0\nbut the brand itself is very holistic and very\u00a0\u00a0 different than a lot of skincare brands\u00a0\nout there so osmosis is all about\u00a0\u00a0 you know no inflammation to your skin he does\u00a0\nnot believe in ripping apart the skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 there are so many brands out there that are harsh\u00a0\nthat are using harsh products or harsh ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 and they're ripping apart your skin barrier\u00a0\nthey're promoting inflammation to your skin and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation is something we don't want we don't\u00a0\nwant inflammation internally but we also don't\u00a0\u00a0 want to be you know inflaming our skin barrier all\u00a0\nthe time either which a lot of skin care brands do\u00a0\u00a0 so that is why um the osmosis products work\u00a0\namazing if you have rosacea because they\u00a0\u00a0 it completely changed my skin like this\u00a0\nline completely changed my skin once i\u00a0\u00a0 you know started balancing you know my internal\u00a0\nissues out with supplements and then using\u00a0\u00a0 the osmosis products topically that is where\u00a0\ni was like wow like i saw insane changes and\u00a0\u00a0 that is what's got me to my skin today so osmosis\u00a0\nproducts the ones that i will say are an absolute\u00a0\u00a0 must if you want to cure your rosacea are going\u00a0\nto be these rescue you guys heard me talk about\u00a0\u00a0 this so much if you are familiar with my\u00a0\nchannel this is all about epidermal repair\u00a0\u00a0 and knocking out inflammation there's nothing like\u00a0\nthis on the market either this truly truly knocks\u00a0\u00a0 out inflammation from deep within your skin\u00a0\nand you need to get rid of that if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea you have a lot of inflammation going\u00a0\non in your skin this is going to knock out the\u00a0\u00a0 redness this is going to help with like the\u00a0\npores and the bumps all of that you need to\u00a0\u00a0 get rid of that inflammation and knock it out\u00a0\nand this is a must this will save your skin\u00a0\u00a0 also the vitamin a's the osmosis vitamin a\u00a0\nproducts again retinaldehyde so much better than\u00a0\u00a0 retinol retinol is still inflaming your skin your\u00a0\nretinol is less potent than your retinaldehydes\u00a0\u00a0 so it's not even as powerful you know you know\u00a0\nin terms of getting that anti-aging effect\u00a0\u00a0 um but retinol is also like i said you're\u00a0\ngonna get peeling you're gonna get flaky\u00a0\u00a0 skin retinaldehyde has no peeling no flaking and\u00a0\nit's truly like one conversion away in the skin\u00a0\u00a0 to retinoic acid so it's amazing for anti-aging\u00a0\nit's been clinically studied again more and more\u00a0\u00a0 for formulators and dermatologists are like oh my\u00a0\ngosh retinaldehyde like that's an ingredient like\u00a0\u00a0 everybody should be talking about using it's like\u00a0\nthe future of vitamin a but osmosis again has been\u00a0\u00a0 using retinal to hide as their vitamin a forever\u00a0\nnow when i first started osmosis when i had\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea i was using calm so calm is your lowest\u00a0\nstrength right now to hide but it changed my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like it literally changed my skin it was so\u00a0\namazing because not only is it your vitamin a and\u00a0\u00a0 like anti-aging but there's so many calming and\u00a0\nlike anti-inflammatory ingredients and it's just\u00a0\u00a0 amazing like for your skin so i highly recommend\u00a0\nit and if you are you know dealing with rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 start with the calm again i'm using renu now which\u00a0\nis the highest strength but i did work my way\u00a0\u00a0 up to that so you basically just pump you\u00a0\nknow some out on your finger you do need the\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist this is part of the whole\u00a0\nliposomal delivery system which is amazing\u00a0\u00a0 it's the best form of delivery system for skin\u00a0\ncare that you can possibly find liposomal delivery\u00a0\u00a0 system if a skin care has that you know they're\u00a0\nlegit because that is the best form that really\u00a0\u00a0 takes the actives of every product and delivers\u00a0\nthem to the skin cell and it stays active the\u00a0\u00a0 liposomal delivery system will draw in that active\u00a0\nand keep it active the whole time it's traveling\u00a0\u00a0 through your skin whereas a lot of other products\u00a0\na lot of brands out there sephora to name a few\u00a0\u00a0 they don't even have delivery systems um\u00a0\nbut then there's other delivery systems that\u00a0\u00a0 will pull the product or the active through your\u00a0\nskin but the active ingredient loses its potency\u00a0\u00a0 you know as it's traveling through to the skin\u00a0\ncell so liposomal delivery system again another\u00a0\u00a0 key component to skin care and it makes another\u00a0\nreason you know it makes the osmosis products\u00a0\u00a0 so so effective but like i was saying when you're\u00a0\nusing their vitamin a serums again rosacea start\u00a0\u00a0 with calm but you will absolutely love it you take\u00a0\na pump of it and then you missed some of the boost\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist with it and then you massage it\u00a0\ninto your skin that's all you have to do but the\u00a0\u00a0 activating mist is needed with it because it is\u00a0\npart of the product and the whole delivery aspect\u00a0\u00a0 stop using your retin-a stop using your retinols\u00a0\nthey're ripping apart your skin and when you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea you are all about anti-inflammatory\u00a0\nproducts and you have to really take care of\u00a0\u00a0 your skin barrier this is one thing that i really\u00a0\nreally started focusing on was my skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 because a lot of times with people you know who\u00a0\nhave rosacea they have a broken down skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 it's you know irritated it's more inflamed and\u00a0\nyou have to build up your skin barrier it's a must\u00a0\u00a0 so many times you know rosacea acne patients\u00a0\nand people they have a broken down skin barrier\u00a0\u00a0 one because those skin conditions cause kind of\u00a0\na breakdown in the skin barrier but two is like\u00a0\u00a0 you just don't know what you're using and you're\u00a0\nusing too harsh of ingredients and you really have\u00a0\u00a0 to baby your skin stop exfoliating stop the crazy\u00a0\nretinols and the retin-a and stuff like that and\u00a0\u00a0 just really baby your skin and really really focus\u00a0\non skin barrier health that's key to where you\u00a0\u00a0 you know really want to start as well and the two\u00a0\nproducts i would recommend for really building\u00a0\u00a0 up your skin barrier sente dermal repair ultra\u00a0\nnourish use this at night you can use it during\u00a0\u00a0 the day as well as your moisturizer but it's got\u00a0\neverything in it that your skin needs to create a\u00a0\u00a0 healthy skin bear it makes such a difference and\u00a0\ni promise you once you really start taking care\u00a0\u00a0 of your skin and using the correct products\u00a0\nand really focusing on skin barrier health\u00a0\u00a0 you will see a difference as well night and day\u00a0\nwith your rosacea this is a product that i used\u00a0\u00a0 way back when i had rosacea and it made such a\u00a0\ndifference you guys and i actually have not talked\u00a0\u00a0 about this recently it's the osmosis immerse and\u00a0\nit's a emu oil facial oil and i've talked about\u00a0\u00a0 this years ago because it honestly made a huge\u00a0\ndifference with my skin so it's an emu oil based\u00a0\u00a0 facial product and it's very anti-inflammatory it\u00a0\nliterally knocks out inflammation but at the same\u00a0\u00a0 time hydrates your skin so amazing and the other\u00a0\ningredients that he has in here are just kind of\u00a0\u00a0 like more natural ingredients like more natural\u00a0\ntype of anti-inflammatory ingredients and it makes\u00a0\u00a0 a huge difference with your rosacea you will\u00a0\nnotice that your skin will start to clear\u00a0\u00a0 up and i swear by this product and then the\u00a0\nlast thing that i would definitely suggest is\u00a0\u00a0 a product like this which is your dna repair\u00a0\nso osmosis has the catalyst ac 11 dna repair\u00a0\u00a0 but then the photozyme md the dna repair brand\u00a0\nas well you need dna repair because it's again\u00a0\u00a0 helping to heal your skin from within dna repair\u00a0\nreally helps with like facial redness and also\u00a0\u00a0 broken capillaries all of that will actually help\u00a0\nto heal itself with dna repair so that is a must\u00a0\u00a0 as well again when you're thinking skincare\u00a0\nand you're really starting you know from the\u00a0\u00a0 very beginning of curing your rosacea stay away\u00a0\nfrom exfoliating for a while and then also stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from like harsh like ingredients stay away\u00a0\nfrom your retin-a's stay away from your retinols\u00a0\u00a0 work on your skin bearer and use skin barrier\u00a0\nlike anti-inflammatory products osmosis will be\u00a0\u00a0 your best friend i can promise you that um and\u00a0\nthat's where i am today that is everything i'm\u00a0\u00a0 doing that's everything i've done with my skin and\u00a0\nlike i said honestly now after all these years i\u00a0\u00a0 actually can eat some dairy and i can eat some\u00a0\ngluten because my body is balanced out i am\u00a0\u00a0 constantly like i said taking the skin the skin\u00a0\ncleanse skin clarifier cleanse i take that every\u00a0\u00a0 other month to make sure everything is cleaned out\u00a0\nin my track you know my digestion track and all of\u00a0\u00a0 that so it allows me to you know not be so strict\u00a0\nwith my diet but that's me now i can only get away\u00a0\u00a0 with doing that now because i've really you know\u00a0\ntook control and balanced everything out it is all\u00a0\u00a0 about balancing internal issues so step one diet\u00a0\nstep two key key issue is supplements get on those\u00a0\u00a0 supplements it will make a huge difference and\u00a0\nthen step three is your topical skin care and\u00a0\u00a0 you need to you know focus on everything that i\u00a0\njust talked about with the topical skincare and\u00a0\u00a0 the three of those steps combined i promise\u00a0\nyou you will see a difference with your skin\u00a0\u00a0 a hundred percent now again this is what worked\u00a0\nfor me it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 100 work the same for you i'm not a doctor this\u00a0\nis just my experience but i can promise you that\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea is not incurable it is not\u00a0\nsomething that you can't treat yourself\u00a0\u00a0 and it's something that you don't need to take\u00a0\nantibiotics for antibiotics actually ruin your gut\u00a0\u00a0 health and that's why so many times when you're on\u00a0\nan antibiotic for rosacea or for acne because they\u00a0\u00a0 throw those things at you like crazy when you go\u00a0\nto the doctor for those skin conditions you start\u00a0\u00a0 taking them and then you have to get off them and\u00a0\nyour acne comes back worse your rosacea comes back\u00a0\u00a0 worse because you actually just messed up\u00a0\nyour entire like microbiome gut health all\u00a0\u00a0 of that because the bad bacteria overtakes\u00a0\nthe good bacteria and you're even worse off\u00a0\u00a0 when you really look at your body and your\u00a0\ndiet and you know all of that internal stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that's your key to treating and curing your\u00a0\nrosacea it is not like an incurable disease\u00a0\u00a0 it is a hundred percent curable your body\u00a0\nis just telling you there's something off\u00a0\u00a0 so that is it you guys i hope this video helped\u00a0\nyou out it's something that i get asked about\u00a0\u00a0 all the time and again it's something i'm very\u00a0\nvery passionate about because i've done it myself\u00a0\u00a0 i have i mean i look at my skin now to this day\u00a0\nand i'm like oh my gosh i can't believe like where\u00a0\u00a0 i was like years ago you know and i was thinking i\u00a0\nwas doomed and nothing was gonna i was just gonna\u00a0\u00a0 get worse and worse and nope like here i am

        "transcript": "[Music] hi everybody it's Dr Eric Corum founder of A7 welcome back to the blueprint where we distill Cutting Edge Science Leadership and life skills into the simple tactics optimized for your busy lifestyle and goals if you are someone you know is dealing with rosacea or inflamed skin this episode is for you my guest Joy McCarthy has helped so many people improve their complexion by getting to the root triggers behind inflammatory skin conditions like rosacea her holistic approach Ro addresses causes you might not expect like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth histamine intolerance hormone issues and many more her lifestyle tweaks and targeted supplement recommendations are designed to help you heal your skin barrier in microbiome from the inside out this is the second episode I've done with joy out skincare the first one blew my mind as we discuss the skin microbiome and eight ingredients in skinc care you should avoid so if you haven't listened to that it's episode 42 12 go back and do that one more thing before we get started my audio is a little bit off in this episode great thing is it's mostly Joy but if you just hang in there you're going to get a ton of benefit from this episode so out of my conversation with joy so let's lean in and learn from the best Joy it seems like rosacea impacts a lot of people as a matter of fact you sent me some stats on this 45 million people worldwide and 14 million people in the US are living with this let's talk about this let's talk about the impact of it on our skin and what we can do to help solve this problem yeah it's you know it's such a misunderstood skin condition and millions of people have it and so many people don't even know they have it so it's when your your cheeks feel hot and they are red and the blood vessels become enlarged and the skin microbiome is compromised the skin is dry and you can get acne like bum bumps and your skin becomes Uber sensitive I dealt with this for about four years and I healed my skin naturally but a lot of the considerations go beyond just like what your skin looks like depression and anxiety are very common with people who suffer from rosacea and the problem is that the dermalogical approach doesn't address the root cause what is the root cause yeah so well there's it's a multifactorial just like all skin conditions it's multiactor there's not one single thing we can kind of get into what some of the causes are but you know the the common treatment is antibiotics both an antibiotic cream and an antibiotic an oral antibiotic sometimes the birth control pill depending on your age and also is becoming more popular Ivermectin which is an anti-parasitic medication I'm sure you've heard about that in days yeah yeah so uh that's become a more common that people are using because some people think that the root cause of their rosacea is the mites that live on their skin we all have mites that live on our skin by the way part of our skin microbiome I know it's pretty gross and and the mites can irritate our skin not because of the mice but because of their poop and it actually creates flushing and redness if you have an unhealthy skin microbiome which means you have too many mites on your skin and that can cause things like rosacea but again it's not a single cause of rosacea hormonal imbalance can be a cause using products that are stripping your skin and altering that Skin Barrier function can cause rosacea I already talked about hormones sleep stress allergens there are so many different factors and also being on certain types of medications so if someone has eczema and they're constantly using cortisone creams a side effect of those creams can be rosacea it's more common in women and more common in women kind of like 40 plus but you know so many we see it across all ages it's a really awful condition sibo is another cause small intestinal bacterial overgrowth 50% of people who have rosacea also have sibo so that shows you the connection because our gut health influences inflammation the microbes depending if they're in the right spot or not influence inflammation hpylori some Studies have shown a relationship between this bacteria that's a bacteria that lives in our gut we all have it some people have too much and some Studies have shown that people with too high H ply Lori also have acneic rosacea I think those are some causes I'm trying to think if there's anything I missed my goodness it's it's like that's a lot of stuff it sounds I know which is so frustrating if you have rosacea trying to figure it out but I think I can share I have you know many different articles and podcasts that I've done on it that kind of go through like what are all of the root causes and you kind of have to just go through all of them if you want to address it from a more natural perspective if you just want to go the conventional route you know if you read any forums or talk to any people's experiences yes they always have relief for about a month or two but then always you read that there's an awful Resurgence they have a huge flare up again because you just can't you can't address you it's not a Band-Aid solution you have to get to the root causes and and address it from a truly holistic approach I mean just stress if you are someone who has always been more prone to Flushing when you're stressed out you have a higher probability of developing rosacea because that's kind of like your weak weak point for me that's definitely my weak point also I'm the poster child Celtic descent fair skin it runs in my family so those are all all factors as well but the good news is there's so much you can do there's so much you can do and it's not it doesn't mean you're going to have it for

Le burnout and injuries our team of sports scientists and performance coaches have worked in the NFL with Elite College athletes and Olympic gold medalists and we're bringing this expertise to you start your 7-Day free trial today by clicking the link in the show [Music] [Applause] notes okay let's just talk about a few of the things that you would start like let's talk about lifestyle what about your lifestyle could you start adjusting yeah so so um getting a handle on stress and making sure that you know you make sleep a priority that's so key your skin cells regenerate more in the night when you're sleeping than any other time on a 24-hour clock so make sleep and Stress Management an absolute priority because you have receptors for cortisol in your skin so stress influences and triggers inflammation in your skin so you know diaphragm breathing box breathing like find ways to healthy ways to better deal with stress and then of course he did an anti-inflammatory diet so limit alcohol alcohol is a big trigger for rosacea sugar refined carbohydrates processed foods inflammatory seed oils so all of those types of foods you want to avoid some people are sensitive to spicy foods and hot foods I mean it's not that they're bad for you but they can just be triggers if you already have a higher probability of developing rosacea eat a really anti-inflammatory diet so lots of different colorful foods make sure you get in lots of healthy fats avocado olives cold water fish all of those omega3 you know cool inflammation all of those types of foods are really key for an anti-inflammatory diet and then consider your gut health because we already talked about there's H pylori there can be sibo if you have disbiosis so too much bad bacteria not enough good bacteria all of these factors come into play developing a skin condition like rosacea and you have to be so careful when you have rosacea about your exposure to the sun because when you have rosacea Your Skin Barrier and your skin microbiome is compromised so you don't have that natural protection so when you go out in the sun you are so it's so much easier to burn so you have to kind of figure out like sunlight is good for us it's really good for our skin but if you have rosacea then you have to be careful so for me I wear sunblock on my face 365 days per year but in the summer I won't always we wear sunscreen on my body because I want that vitamin D conversion to happen in my skin so it's just about protect the areas that you know could be potentially sensitive to the Sun what about supplements yeah so there's lots of good supplements um for rosacea the first one that comes to mind is very anti-inflammatory and that's coratin so coratin and but you have to make sure so that's a phyton nutrient you have to make sure it is a bioavailable form because cortin is very poorly absor absorbed so coratin is great because not only is it anti-inflammatory but it inhibits the release of histamine histamine a whole other root cause histamine intolerance is a big root cause of rosacea as well what does histamine do it vasod dilates what happens in rosacea you have too much vasod dilation so cors keeps the skin calm great for allergies too if anyone suffers from allergies GLA from barrage oil is a fantastic it's one of the Omega sixes that are actually good a research shows that it helps prevent dryness of the skin irritation and redness of the skin so I'm a huge fan of gla it's harder to get in our diet you can get it from eating hemp seeds hemp hearts do you eat hemp hearts were you I don't personally I know what you're talking about though yes yeah they're such a great source of protein I think two or three tablespoons is 10 grams of protein which is pretty good for a plant-based protein that's a lot yeah so that fatty acid is found in hemp so hemp oil you could replace uh for example your salad dressing with a hemp oil zinc is another good one but you have to be careful with zinc because zinc can offset other minerals yes copper but zinc is really important for healthy skin for skin cell regeneration and that's really key so zinc is also very anti-inflammatory and then I'm a big fan of mushrooms so RI taking Rishi as a supplement just make sure that the supplement is a dual extract to ensure that you get all those medicinal compounds but RI on so many different levels is great for healthy skin supports your immune system it helps to inhibit the release of histamine and it is a fantastic mushroom for helping your body better adapt to stress so I'm a really big fan is like the calm mushroom so like RI is so powerful that if you are someone who is affected by caffeine in coffee if you have your coffee with Rishi and you normally get affected by the caffeine you'll probably notice a big difference uh you'll just feel like more of a clean energy but you have to make sure that it's a dual extract so heat and alcohol extraction because there's so many mushroom supplements out there that they're honestly just fluff and dust and not good quality this is so interesting if people want to learn more about you learn more about your work where can they find you yes so they can find me at joyous Health Jo y us health.com uh is my website and also on Instagram follow me on Instagram and on Tik Tok I'm on there as well so I'm

        "transcript": "hello to say it's been a hot minute is a drastic understatement but what I'm glad to report is that my skin is clear my rosacea people say it's incurable I don't care I never believed it I never wanted to believe it so I kept searching for me it's been since 2016 and it's now 2023. it's about time I would say and in this video I want to share with you uh the things that have really helped me have changed and revolutionized my skin I spent a long time believing that it was difficult to heal and that the more pain I put myself through the stretch of the regimen the more likely it was that I was doing the right thing and that I would get better that was never the case and I've had times where I feel like I've healed and then I've backtracked I got mold poisoning and everything came back even with a Vengeance I became you know having reactions to all types of food when I had made so much progress before and I just thought when is enough enough and it was actually last year in August when I got I was before August it was in June last year when I got covered and I got significantly worse again everything got re-triggered and activated and I was just fed up and you know in those moments where you go nut enough is enough what I'm doing is not working it has gotten me this far it's not getting me any further and you hit this like roadblock and it's so frustrating and you just want to cry and you're overwhelmed I hit that point back in June 2022 and I turned around and went I'm doing it differently so I met this friend through my blog in the raw and I had helped her with her rosacea journey and she came back around and swung back around and helped me with my rosacea Journey now her recommendation to me was to try particular products this is not a sponsored ad I have nothing to do with anything I would never do that um but I'm just going to share with you what worked because I think I owe it to you and I've I've recommended it to multiple different people and the results that they've had has just been amazing uh because it works and all of a sudden what I found in my health Journey was that it went from being super difficult to being very clear this is getting rid of the cause I don't have to like starve myself and worry about everything being just so otherwise I'm going to have this awful reaction which is what it was all of a sudden I'm getting better and better and I can eat I was so happy and it was such a relief because every day my skin is getting consistently better consistently better consistently better and it's just like for the first time it's not get a bit better get a little bit worse get a bit better get a little bit worse and just like this journey of just uncertainty and like is it this is it that enough you know we have to deal with enough things that we shouldn't be having to worry you know constantly about what we eat about changing our pillow every five minutes about worrying about touching our face and just all these like finicky things that we we obsess over when we have such severe issues we think oh if we do all these miniature things like then my skin will be okay as if it's your fault that your skin is not okay that you are doing something fundamentally wrong well sometimes it's about finding the root of how it occurred and allowing yourself to enjoy life and ease into the things that you want to ease into um so this is what these products did for me and oh I should probably show you what they are I didn't organize that very well this is a bit impromptu so the products that I started using were recommended by my friend who also had a severe formal rosacea very similar presentation to mine we have very different Journeys but very similar presentation and I was super skeptical at first I was I it actually she recommended to me nine months earlier and I kept thinking to myself I wish I tried this earlier uh but who cares it was perfect timing that's just the same it was perfect timing so I tie the products I but before I did I start going no like I just nosedive into all of this person's content he was originally a doctor dermatologist who got sick of the fact that the typical way that Dermatology functions the options are laser antibiotics or anti-inflammatories all of which can cause a lot of damage and for many of you I know because I speak to so many people around the world their rosacea got significantly worse after taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatories because it exacerbates the underlying cause now controversial thing to say but I'm going to say it so he started questioning that and started formulating uh and researching to what might work and rosacea is such a complex skin condition it seems to be one of the most difficult skin conditions and the one that doctors seem to believe cannot be eradicated cannot be reversed but I have reversed the vast majority of my allergies before I get to the solution I just want to share with you something so exciting for the past three weeks I have been eating gluten I've been eating all these things that I normally would be like I'm never eating that again it's so bad for you um and just enjoying food and just loving life um so uh and I still listen to my body anyway the point is let's get to the product so I started using and researching and deep diving into a product called as osmosis or a brand called osmosis I began with their rescue serum uh which helped with my dry painful red and flaky skin it was so painful and so red I'll show you before and afters um I mean you can see the after but the befores of when I start before I started using these products it's just crazy like the inflammation not just the redness and the bumps I had like a nose bump like this but also the puffiness of my eyes the swelling of my cheeks like I also had like a double chin um even though I'm the same size so I was just overall really inflamed and swollen and that's because it's autoimmune issues now I thought on the rescue and immediately I felt insane relief like previously I had been putting on so much Derma vigils like just slapping on the lipids just to try and almost like a Vaseline just like trying to cover my um my barrier so that it would not be leaking moisture all the time because it was so itchy and so sore I was applying it multiple times a day I couldn't go anywhere without it I would never ever dream of you know not cleansing my face or going through my routine if I woke up I immediately had to go to the bathroom and wash my face because I was in agony always when I wake up when I go to bed now sometimes I forget to wash my face I actually don't know who I am anymore I'm pretty good though like it's it's not a regular occurrence but that's the level I don't it it's not like an everyday Obsession because it's not painful it's it's livable I mean it's pretty good so okay rescue fantastic product it's a DNA Repair Serum it helps to heal scars does all these things for collagen look it up um I'll probably put some links below uh so that you can have a little bit of a look-see but Dr Ben Johnson has so much so many YouTube videos online I'll tell you all the other things that I also used as well so I started with rescue and I also started with regenerate which was a liver it's meant to help regenerate the liver and help the liver so Dr Ben's theory is that with rosacea it's either liver induced or it's candida introduced and he has things on the website to determine what that is you can also email him uh and I'll put his email down below you can email him personally and he will respond to you um for free so that's really generous um it's getting harder and harder for him to do it within you know a week or so but it's worth it regenerate he told me I needed to go on it for nine months I hit the nine month Mark I think a month ago um and now I'm off all the internal products and my skin stays consistently really good it's improving all the time every month and so regenerate was the second one I also after I started doing the regenerate I was making a lot of progress but I wasn't making it's like I was making progress in some areas of my skin and not in other areas and when I sent some photos to Dr Ben he said you also have candida rosacea so I went on his candida protocol as well as the liver protocol and I started as I was detoxing my skin that's why I started with the rescue because it helps detox as well detox and heal after I started with the rescue I started adding other elements into my regimen but if it was causing the detox to happen too strongly I would pair back and wait I think it took me three months before I could go on some of these other repair serums I went on stem factor which helps with like collagen and scarring and then I also wanted to try Catalyst Ace 11. once you start learning about all these incredible products and what they do for your skin it's like I want to try I want to try but you have to slow down and so I now have implemented I've got stem Factor rescue the um correct serum I started off with calm which is better for rosacea skin you start off with calm and then uh Catalyst ac11 every now and again um and that's really good for elasticity and it's just all of it helps with different things for the skin especially when you're doing repair like I've had almost what seven years of skin damage and breakage to make up for so my skin is loving it the first thing I realized when I put this topical stuff on my skin was oh it's fading my skin my my skin feels fed uh so that was really great and then um yeah so you can look up what his candida protocol is it's um something called uh you take these capsules called clarify it helps you clear out mucus which apparently is what candida different types of candida feeds off and then you take this like spray Elixir thing which helps reduce the population of the candida so I did that for three months and noticed significant effects and then I just continued to improve as I continue to take regenerate and I also took his fat supplement which I forget the name of at this point in time uh that one's really amazing as well I took that for three months because I in the past had really bad I just I just didn't have enough natural oils and lipids in my skin um that's also something that could help aid your skin as well as not having enough oils because I wasn't absorbing it because my liver wasn't functioning properly so I wasn't absorbing fat and I've noticed like I used to have a lot of pulling like my skin was pulling and tight because it didn't have enough lipids and fats and I've done you know a lot of skin scans now and the pulling is no longer there so my skin is now like having this vibrant lipid look the youthful look or whatever I know I'm younger whatever I did have like all these what appeared to be like all these Fine Lines because my skin was so dry I would highly recommend giving it a go emailing Dr Ben again this isn't sponsored but I just wanted to give you guys an update because I want more people to know about what works and at the end of the day it's all about having a better relationship with your body learning to love yourself more and living the most vibrant life you can so you can start giving to others one of the things that I struggle with the most and I think we do struggle with in self-esteem when your skin severely affects your life especially with more severe skin conditions or ones that are autoimmune related they really significantly can impact your life and it impacts your ability to contribute to the world to actualize yourself to Greater to Greater degrees it might affect travel it might affect the activities you participate in it may affect the you know the confidence level of you to be able to make contacts and friends and further yourself and your career it might reduce your ability to earn and therefore give back to society maybe you want to make more contributions to Charities causes all these things like it affects every area of your life and people don't realize the significant impact and so that's why I'm sharing this with you because I feel like the past nine months of my life 10 months I think it's 10 or 11 months now I can't even count anymore I've just lost track have been transformed because of this so let me know how you go let me know your thoughts let me know if you've tried it before and yeah I would love to see how it helps you and if you tried it as a result of watching this video anyway lots of love to you and um good luck on your skin Journey",

        "published_at": "2023-05-14T15:30:15Z",
        "transcript": "if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you're probably having a hard time coming with a skincare regimen or finding skincare products that are effective for you well today in this video we're going to discuss rosacea and I'm going to give you over-the-counter skincare that can help stay tuned till the end because I will make a skincare regimen for your rosacea skin type with actual product recommendations so my name is Dr Swati Canon and I'm a board certified dermatologist out here in California thank you so much for watching this video and welcome to my channel what is rosacea rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness flushing sometimes pimple like bumps on your cheeks your nose your chin as well as textural changes of the nose chin and forehead even various triggers can flare or worsen rosacea and some of these common triggers include alcohol spicy foods sun exposure even stress and I know stress can worsen really anything but stress definitely can worsen rosacea as well as certain histamine-rich foods like tomatoes avocados certain skincare products can also rest in rosacea so there are a lot of triggers for rosacea and a lot of people don't really know what their triggers are so I recommend sometimes keeping a diary so you can know like hey I had red wine and now I have redness and flushing and all the rosacea symptoms or I had an avocado toast yesterday and now my rosacea is worse so keeping a diary can help with noticing what your triggers are but you know it is annoying to keep a diary so I get it rosacea can also affect really any ethnicity and any gender but it is more common in middle-aged Caucasian men and women unfortunately rosacea is chronic like a lot of our inflammatory conditions and there is no cure there are different types of rosacea so we have categorized them into different subsets the first type is called erythamato telangiotatic rosacea I know I don't know why dermatologists have such long words but this type of rosacea is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels or dilated blood vessels on the skin the second type is called Popular are popular postular rosacea and this is when you get pimple like bumps kind of in the middle of your face often acne and popular puscular rosacea can go together so they can be seen together the third type is called fiberous rosacea and this is when you get a thickening of skin or like a bulbous appearance on your nose and finally there's also ocular rosacea this is rosacea affecting the eyes causing redness tearing itching and sometimes vision problems now these categories are actually kind of fluid and changing there is an overlap between all of these categories so you can have you know erythematode rosacea and popular puscular rosacea so there's a lot of overlap but it just kind of helps to Define and gives us guidelines for treatment this video is going to focus on redness and the pimple form of rosacea and how to calm down the Baseline inflammation in rosacea patients thymus and ocular rosacea there is not really any over-the-counter treatment that helps for that so those require prescription or in-office treatments what are the best in ingredients for rosacea the main thing for rosacea patients is to use anti-inflammatory and hydrating ingredients goal is to have a simple yet effective skin care regimen that decreases the inflammation and doesn't cause irritation so you don't want to overuse skin care products the first ingredient for rosacea that I really love is azolic acid we've talked about azelaic acid a lot on my channel and even in my previous video that gave you ingredients for discoloration as a lake acid is one of them so it is one of the best ingredients for acne for rosacea for skin lightening it is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial meaning that it decreases some of the bacteria that play a role in rosacea over the counter you can find 10 azelic acid and we also give prescription strength which is 15 or 20 percent acetylic acid it's best to use acelic acid at night time most rosacea patients are not going to be able to tolerate a retinoid so you're going to use azelic acid instead the next ingredient for rosacea patients is niacinamide and this is a form of vitamin B3 and again I have talked about it a lot nice and mind is in a lot of skincare products especially in moisturizers it's helpful for redness it is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for hydration it also regulates oil production it reduces the appearance of pores so it's really an overall great ingredient for rosacea patients who also have probably all these other issues I don't recommend using niacinamide above five percent I recommend staying under five percent so notorium has a five percent niacinamide gel that you can try also a lot of moisturizers sunscreens they do have niacinamide so you don't have to use niacinamide separately I actually recommend using niacinamide in a moisturizer or in a sunscreen versus by itself tranexamic acid is the other ingredient for rosacea I definitely have it in my previous video where I talk about how helpful it is for hyperpigmentation and melasma it is also so helpful for rosacea because we now know that txa regulates blood vessel formation excessive blood vessel formation and dilation of blood vessels is what causes the redness and the flushing in rosacea patients and so when we can regulate it we can really minimize the appearance of redness txa is also very gentle so it is very well tolerated by most rosacea patients the one that I like is the notorium tranexamic acid serum this contains five percent tranexamic acid and niacinamide plus kojic acid it's helpful for lightning and for rosacea the next ingredient for rosacea is sodium sulfacedamide plus sulfur so sodium sulfacetamide is an anti-inflammatory skincare ingredient but this is often a prescription and it's really hard to find it over the counter however you can find sulfur soaps over the counter and sulfur is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial and that's kind of how it helps rosacea it is incredibly stinky sulfur smells like rotten eggs so some people just can't tolerate the smell of it but sulfur also helps with acne it helps with dandruff called cyborg dermatitis there's a lot of uses for this ingredient so just to clear up any confusion the first ingredient I talked about was sodium sulfacetamide and this can come as a face wash but it's hard to find it over the counter it's usually a prescription we combine sodium sulfacinamide with sulfur and that combination is very good for rosacea but you can also just find sulfur alone as a soap and this is what's usually found over the counter and sulfur alone has some of these properties that I just talked about the next ingredient for rosacea is using ceramides so ceramides are emollients that I've spoken about in the moisturizer video before and ceramides repair the Skin Barrier and they help to hydrate the skin so for rosacea patients it's incredibly important to maintain your skin barrier to protect that Skin Barrier so that you don't get too much irritation I like products like Ulta MD or CeraVe that make moisturizers and sunscreen with ceramides and niacinamide glycerin is another really great humectant for rosacea patients because glycerin is such a powerful hydrating ingredient so it really draws in that water to help moisturize your skin the next ingredient for rosacea is called acetyl tetrapeptide 40. so remember in my peptide video and I don't know if you guys watched it if you haven't watched watch my peptide video please go check it out but in my peptide video I talked about certain peptides that are anti-inflammatory an acetyl Tetra peptide 40 is an anti-inflammatory peptide that can be very helpful for rosacea it helps to reduce inflammation as well as redness it also helps to maintain the Skin Barrier and to protect the Skin Barrier function there are also other peptides that can be anti-inflammatory in fact Paula's Choice peptide booster has multiple peptides several of which are anti-inflammatory and can be very helpful for redness and rosacea patients by the way if you're enjoying and learning from this video please hit the Thumbs Up Button And subscribe to my channel and please also share this video with others who would find it helpful I am trying to grow my channel in 2023 so I am very grateful to all of you who are watching commenting and interacting with my content another really great rosacea ingredient is called and I'm gonna butcher this Camila Camila sinensis anyway this is green tea leaf extract so green tea leaf extract is really helpful for rosacea green tea as we know is very anti-inflammatory it's a very powerful antioxidant and it is used in skincare sometimes especially for rosacea skin another ingredient that I'm going to butcher is called Santa Nella asiatica definitely can't pronounce that but we're going to continue so Santa Nella asiatica in India we actually have this ingredient as well but we call it go to kala and it has many many benefits I actually remember taking gotu kala when I was little for colds it is a powerful antioxidant it is anti-inflammatory and it also helps a lot for inflammation with rosacea patients so it has become a lot more popular in America and it's become a lot more popular in skincare recently in the last few years so beauty of joseon is a Korean skincare brand that actually has a serum that contains a green tea leaf extract Centinela asiatica and vitamin B5 so it's very calming it's hydrating and it's also fragrance free so for rosacea patients that's like a winner have you guys tried Korean skincare products and Korean sunscreens if so please let me know and comment below I really love how Koreans approach skincare with their hydrating and calming ingredients so I think I'm definitely gonna make a YouTube video about it soon but let me know what Korean skincare products you have tried so that I can also look into them Dr jart psychopair tiger grass serum tiger grass or pear serum this has Centinela asiatica and niacinamide it also has like a greenish tint so you can use it in the morning because the green tip helps to cover redness and then it's anti-inflammatory for the actual rosacea component Dr jart sick a pear stick a player is it sick of pear or a single player crap sometimes like I cannot remember these names but this particular line of product also has a moisturizer with similar ingredients that is very common for rosacea patients so you can either use it in a serum or as a moisturizer burrito Centinela green level safe SPF 50 p8 plus plus this isn't a really great sunscreen by the way for rosacea and acne important patients because it contains Centinela asiatica niacinamide vitamin E is an SPF 50. so I really do like this sunscreen fertilization patients and if you've tried it let me know the other sunscreens I normally like for rosacea patients I tend to like sunscreens with zinc oxide so which is a physical sunscreen and I like physical sunscreens over chemical sunscreens because sometimes chemical sunscreens can worsen or trigger rosacea but there are certain chemical sunscreen formulations that are okay that are more well tolerated and one of them is the Ulta MD UV clear and I recommend this for a lot of different patients but it's a really great sunscreen with SPF 46 it contains niacinamide and it's very well tolerated a La Roche Posay also makes various sunscreens for rosacea patients and these are also pretty well tolerated so not all chemical sunscreens are going to flare your rosacea in general I do prefer physical sunscreens but some chemical formulations are okay by the way let's clear up differences between sensitive skin rosacea and having allergies or rashes to certain skin care products so some sensitive skin that's a broad category of patients that just means that you can't tolerate skin care more readily this includes your rosacea patients but you can also have sensitive skin without having rosacea sensitive skin means you're more likely to get rashes or irritation or acne more easily so it's really a broad category that includes various skin types rosacea is what I just said earlier where you have dilated blood vessels and can be characterized by flushing or pimple like bumps this is different than people who get an allergic or contact dermatitis or a rash from exposure to certain ingredients and skin care products or to even certain metals or to other types of preservatives so the most common example of contact dermatitis is nickel dermatitis and dermatitis by the way just means inflammation of the skin so that's a very non-specific term but nickel dermatitis you might have seen this is when patients or when people get a rash around their belly button because of coming into contact with the nickel and the button and the pants or the jeans so if you you tend to get contact dermatitis a common way to test for this at home is you can apply skincare product on your forearm for one to six weeks and see if you get any rashes or irritation if not you can then try the product on your face now this by the way this test the forearm test doesn't work for rosacea patients so rosacea patients it's very hard to see for skincare products can help you or harm you until you try but for rosacea patients what you can do is just try on the side of your face and see if you if you get a flare what are my ingredients to avoid in rosacea skin salicylic acid is one ingredient to avoid even if you have acne and rosacea so I know we commonly use salicylic acid for acne it is anti-inflammatory but it is also so irritating that we don't really recommend it for rosacea patients and this is a similar concept for benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide also is anti-inflammatory we also use it for acne but I don't always recommend it for rosacea patients because they can be irritating perhaps in low percentages it would be okay we just have other ingredients that we can use so we don't have to use these and this is the same for glycolic acid which is a type of chemical exfoliating acid because it's irritating or it can be irritating I also don't recommend it for rosacea now on the flip side polyhydroxy acids which are like a newer type of exfoliating acid they can be helpful for rosacea because they are less irritating they are more gentle and they can be anti-inflammatory so some rosacea patients can try polyhydroxy acids by the way not everyone needs to exfoliate so your skin naturally exfoliates on its own you don't have to use a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid or polyhydroxy acid to help exfoliate so don't feel the need to do so other ingredients like witch hazel Menthol camphor those all cause tingling that doesn't mean by the way it's working but they're all kind of these tingling irritating ingredients and I don't recommend them for rosacea other astringents or toners that contain alcohol or heavy content of alcohol definitely avoid this if you have rosacea because it can be so drying on the other hand though rose water toner can be helpful because rose water is coming and I actually made this video it talks about at home remedies for skin hair and nails if you're interested you can definitely go check it out fragrance if you see that on the label that could potentially also be irritating for rosacea so I would be mindful about it but by the way when you're looking at fragrance and alcohol you know you have to also see where it is on the ingredient list so if alcohol is like the sixth or seventh ingredient in the ingredient list it's probably gonna be okay and it's not going to dehydrate your skin that much but if it's in the top three ingredients then that means that that skin care product has too much alcohol and could potentially dehydrate your skin so retinoids I mean they are really an anti-aging Powerhouse but they can definitely trigger and flare rosacea so you do have to be careful I don't think retinoids are completely off limits for rosacea patients it really depends on how severe your rosacea is and what your triggers for rosacea are you know you just want to be careful so if you're going to want to use retinoids and you have rosacea you want to start very gentle gentle retinoids and then slowly increase their use as tolerated so to learn how to incorporate retinoids you can actually watch one of my first YouTube videos ever on retinoids and it really kind of teaches you how to incorporate a retinoid slowly into your skincare regimen some good options for retinoids in rosacea patients include this Keels Retinol Serum it's ceramides and peptides so this one contains retinol which is a gentler former for retinoid also and it contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides and peptides so start this one slowly but it is a good option for rosacea patients of course if you see an irritation or you see flaring of your rosacea stop any of these skincare products immediately the other good one for rosacea patients is the ordinary Grand active retinol Emulsion brand active retinol is a much gentler type of retinoid so it's really great for rosacea and sensitive skin types and this one also contains squalene invisible law which are ingredients that help with inflammation and hydration and it doesn't contain the shark squalene but the vegan version of squalene now how would you combine all of these ingredients for a skincare regimen in the morning you can use a gentle cleanser so you can actually use the sulfur wash or a prescription sodium sulfacetamide wash like I talked about earlier or you can just use a gentle cleanser like the La Roche Posay tolerain hydrating gentle cleanser or CeraVe gentle cleanser after you clean your face you can use one of the green tea serums like the beauty of joseon green tea serum or the Dr jarts like a pear serum followed by a moisturizer and then sunscreen on top so your moisturizer recommendations include like the Dr jarts like a pear moisturizer or a banana cream moisturizer or a CeraVe moisturizer really anything that's gentle and contains ceramides is a good moisturizer for rosacea patients and you would then follow this up by a sunscreen like the Alta MD UV clear sunscreen which also contains ceramides and niacinamide at night time you can again clean your your face and make sure you use a gentle cleanser to wash off even the makeup of your face you can then use a gentle retinoid like the Kiehl's Retinol Serum or you can use acelaic acid at night time so if you're going to use salicylic acid you can actually use it every single night as long as you don't get irritation but if you want to start a retinoid then you can use a retinoid twice a week and use azelic acid on the other night you would then follow this up with a moisturizer as well and some good moisturizer for rosacea patients include Ulta mdpm therapy or that Dr jart sickle player moisturizer that I talked about earlier on a side note if you do wear makeup and heavily tinted sunscreens and you have rosacea I still recommend that you double cleanse so you can watch this video on double cleansing to learn how to do it well for rosacea patients I don't want you to use any cleansers that strip the moisture off your face so to remove the makeup I recommend the cleansing bombs like the pharmacy Green Clean cleansing balm which is very hydrating and then you would follow the cleansing balm with a gentle cleanser an alternate skin care regimen would be this so in the morning you would cleanse like I talked about above you can then use a vitamin C serum and we'll talk about that soon followed by a moisturizer and then Alta you know the Alta MD sunscreen at night time again you can double cleanse use your azelaic acid and then a niacinamide moisturizer so as you notice I did mention vitamin C even if you have rosacea and vitamin C can really help with rosacea because it is anti-inflammatory and so it can help with some of the flares that rosacea patients have however certain forms of vitamin C and high concentrations of vitamin C can also flare rosacea so if you want to learn how to use vitamin C and you have rosacea make sure to check out this video that I have on vitamin C where I give vitamin C recommendations for rosacea patients and you can learn how to use it in your skincare regimen so thank you so much for

        "transcript": "if you are someone who suffers with acne rosacea this video is for you because I'm going to share some natural tips how to get rid of it fast now some of the causes of acne rosacea that you probably haven't heard about is the fact that lack of enough natural sunlight exposure can be one of the causes and too much blue light so artificial light whether that's from your devices from your energy efficient light bulbs in your home that blue light toxicity is more damaging to your skin than actual sunlight is another factor is man-made EMF so electromagnetic fields again from our wireless and our cell phones and all these things around us can definitely aggravate that overall inflammation in your system making that acne rosacea worse now another issue is what's going on with your gut so when you look at traditional Chinese medicine and how your face is a map for what's going on internally in your organs this has and this area of the body feet and the Cheeks is related to things happening in the stomach so if you have poor digestion maybe leaky gut syndrome this can manifest in the skin as the acne rosaceous you've got to take care of that gut as well and we know that some people when they overexert themselves they have this flushing of the face this is something that happens to me in my hot yoga classes I get very very red if that is actually a diagnosis of acne rosacea I don't know I don't like those words of diagnosing things anyway if you've seen my other videos before but this could be as it's related to that internal inflammation possibly another cause can be Demodex mites I've got other videos on what those are and how to get rid of those naturally and we know that stress will always make the acne rosacea worse we know that the symptoms of acne rosacea include the cheeks of course with that overall redness and it can manifest around the eyes as well and inflammation in general so one of the markers for inflammation and the body is called something the hscrp is something that can be checked in your blood work the next time that you go to your doctors and that will give you some indication as to what is going on with the overall inflammation in your body okay but here are my nine tips how to get rid of acne rosacea fast so tip number one get some natural sunlight exposure and that means especially that early morning sunlight is going to be really important for decreasing the overall inflammation in your body so when you get up in the morning ideally if you can spend 20 to 30 minutes outside as that sun is rising this is ideal midday a little bit of UV is going to be helpful as well and as the Sun is setting that sunlight exposure is going to be helpful for your acne rosacea tip number two if you are on a computer and you need to be on devices a lot try to do that near an open window or even better outside in natural sunlight that will help to counteract all of that blue light by having all the it and the full spectrum of light from the sun and being outdoors tip number three is don't use your cell phone especially first thing in the morning when you wake up in bed and after the sun has set again that blue light toxicity is going to cause more and more inflammation in your body it is going to work against you in terms of your acne rosacea tip number four is wear your blue light blocking glasses this is something whenever I'm on devices especially after the sun has set in my home I always have my glasses my entire family does as well and this is really important to protect from that blue light in your eyes but also cover your skin because you don't want to have that exposure on your skin as well from your artificial lights tip number five is to decrease your stress whatever that means for you please check out my other channel be still and listen to the binaural beats and that healing frequencies of Music really great for decreasing your stress tip number six is to use products topically on the skin and one of those products in has been found in the research is iron oxide so this is often a pigment that is added into and can be added into sunscreens especially if you make your own with carrot seed oil and zinc oxide and in this study show to enhance the photo protection when applied topically to the Skin So helping to protect against some of that blue light tip number seven is to make sure that you've got that healthy gut and that healthy microbiome so whether that means doing some cleanup meaning doing some type of parasite cleansing with herbal medicines a few times a year along with a full body detox is something that I really like to educate people about doing and doing that naturally and doing it regularly also putting the good guys back in so those probiotics really important for that healthy microbiome because remember that manifests in the face as the acne rosacea tip number eight make sure you're eating a healthy diet high in the omega-3 fatty acids so this is a reason why I love seafood and eating local and in-season Foods is going to go a long way to decrease that overall inflammation in your body and number nine I always like to talk about that Mind Body Connection so we often see with inflammatory skin disorders that this has a lot to do with disliking of the self so bringing in and implicating your self-worth how you feel about yourself if there's an underlying anger that inflammatory response underneath the surface that maybe isn't being expelled that is something to think about as well in terms of your acne rosation why it was manifest in the first place and by resolving those mind-body connections it will go a long way to help with your rosacea now for more information on how to get clear skin please check out my video four simple tips to clear skin detox I'll see you there",

        "transcript": "Hello everyone welcome back to my channel. It\u2019s Zhenia. Today we have a highly requested topic, it's\nhow to treat rosacea at home. A few of you messaged me the other day asking\nme to make a video about rosacea. I actually have quite a few success stories\nin helping clients successfully treat signs of rosacea. So I created a series of videos for you. If you watched my videos before you know that\nI'm a big believer in treating your skin both from the outside and from the inside. A lot of the skin concerns that we are experiencing\nare actually coming from within our body, and then they just show on our skin. In this video we're going to talk about what\ncauses rosacea, what triggers rosacea outbreaks, and how to treat it internally, with the help\nof food supplements. Just a quick disclaimer, I'm not a medical\nprofessional, so all the advice in the video is purely for informational purposes only\nand I would recommend you consult with your doctor before trying any of the treatments\nrecommended in the video. I also have one more cool thing to share with\nyou. So because my videos are so information packed,\nand I don't expect you to remember all the tips that I'm about to share with you, I created\na little cheat sheet for you. When this video is over just go ahead and\ndownload it, the link is going to be in the description below. So the first part of the video we're going\nto talk about what causes rosacea, and also what triggers rosacea. So those are two separate issues, but before\nwe begin, I'm gonna give you a little bit of statistics, according to some recent surveys,\nabout 14. million of people in America alone are struggling\nwith rosacea, and what makes it worse that 78% of people don't know how to identify and\ntreat rosacea. So those 78% of people, they probably are\nnever even seeking treatments. So what does rosacea look like and how can\nyou identify if you have this skin condition?There are actually four types of rosacea, and in\nthis video we're going to discuss two most common ones. So the first most common type of rosacea is\nyou just simply having a lot of facial redness, flushing, also sometimes you have dilated\nblood vessels, or broken capillaries. The second most common type of rosacea is\nacne rosacea. Both of these types of rosacea have the medical\nterms that I'm gonna make sure to include for your information, but just for the simplicity\npurposes, I'm gonna refer to them as rosacea, and acne rosacea in this video. Again, I just want to make it simple and understandable\nbut I'm gonna make sure to include the terms in the cheat sheet that I've provided for\nyou today. Now that we know the symptoms of rosacea and\nwhat it looks like, let\u2019s talk about the causes. There are several causes of rosacea. The first one is hereditary. So, rosacea affects mostly people who have\nfair skin tone, and who have the Northern European descent. The scientists believe that the second cause\nof rosacea is that your blood vessels dilate too easily, which is usually caused, either\nby a weakened immune system, weakened skin barrier, loss of collagen, or all of the above. The main factors that contribute to that are\nthe sun and the stress, both of them weaken your immune system and your skin barrier,\nbut also sun will increase the collagen loss, which will make the supportive skin structures\nin your skin even weaker. So you're gonna have even more symptoms of\nrosacea. Other triggers of rosacea are hot and spicy\nfoods, hot temperature foods or like even if you have a hot tea, alcohol consumption\nand just simply becoming overheated so if you have a very intense cardio workout, or\nif you go to the sauna all of that can make your symptoms worse. The third cause of rosacea is something known\nas H. pylori bacteria in your gut. Now that we talked about the causes of rosacea\nand what triggers it, let's finally talk about the solutions, because that's what you\u2019re\nhere for, right? There are a few things that you can take internally,\nand it's gonna not only cure rosacea but add to your overall body wellness. Because when you have rosacea you're not supposed\nto have any dairy any yogurt, probiotics may not be a good option for you. If you look for the supplement called prebiotic\nfructooligosaccharides, that can help feed good bacteria in your gut, and it will not\nonly help you with rosacea symptoms if they are caused by H. pylori bacteria, but it will\njust help you with your gut health in general. Another effective supplement is indole three\ncarbinol, which is a really good antioxidant and also detoxifying enzyme. That will also help you clear out your gut\nand help you with that good bacteria growth. The third popular food supplement is milk\nthistle. It's also really great antioxidant and liver\ndetoxifier. The next one is the oil of oregano, it's a\nnatural antibiotic, so you can take it internally and it will also help you with that good bacteria. Tip number five and the final tip is really\nfocus on foods and supplements that boost immune system, and you can add mushrooms to\nyour diet, a lot of the mushrooms are considered to be adaptogens so they really boost the\nimmune system, and also make sure you're getting all your vitamins, however, again talking\nabout vitamins you have to be careful what foods you're eating. Good source of vitamin C is citrus, but when\nyou have symptoms of rosacea citrus can actually make it worse also. Make sure to check out the cheat sheet where\nI'm gonna include all the foods that can trigger more symptoms of rosacea. Go and download that right now. Thank you so much for watching.

        "transcript": "today i'm going to share with you my rosacea story i'm going to tell you about the six stages i went through to totally eradicate my symptoms and if it worked for me then it could work for you too so keep watching because what have you got to lose except perhaps your rosacea [Music] doctors will tell you the cause of rosacea is unknown and that there's no cure they'll also tell you that your only option is to treat your symptoms with medications probably for the rest of your life and they'll also warn you the condition might worsen with age well i'm here to tell you that your doctor's rosacea diagnosis is no medical doctor ever cured rosacea the best they can hope for is to temporarily master symptoms using pharmaceuticals and in some persons these medical interventions can even worsen the condition over time but i'm going to take you down a very different path my journey with rosacea forced me to address all the potential causes of the condition and then to rectify those issues in a logical systematic manner first we need to jump back 15 years to a rather dark period in my life from rosetta first to hold now i'm sure that those of you who suffer from this adult skin condition will understand exactly what i'm about to say next because to put it bluntly rosacea truly is a curse it literally appears out of the blue generally taking hold within a very short period of time and it can absolutely dominate your life destroying your self-confidence in the process nowadays however i'm 100 rosacea free and i never suffer relapses to achieve this i made only a few simple changes in my life nothing difficult nothing expensive anyone can do it and i guarantee that anybody who follows my example will experience positive results so here's my story detailing exactly what i did to permanently eradicate my rosacea back in 2007 when i first noticed my initial rosacea symptoms i just assumed it was mild acne now that in itself was a little confusing because i hadn't had acne since i was a teenager and i was now 47 so i tried using various medicated face wash products and sport creams but they just seem to make things worse causing more redness and drying on my skin so at this point all i'm thinking is what the hell is this on my face and to make things worse at the time i was working as an anti-aging consultant being paid to give health advice to my clients so you can imagine how that must have looked would you take health advice from somebody with a red spotty complexion probably not and we would blame you so i stopped all acne treatments there and then and decided to focus my efforts on identifying the condition and hopefully getting the appropriate treatment well of course it didn't take long to figure out that rosacea was the most likely candidate so i thought great now i know what it is i'll simply get an appointment with my doctor and i'll have my lovely clear skin back in no time but oh how soon that feeling of confidence gets dashed i wonder how many of us have heard that we're following words uttered by our doctor or dermatologist there is no cure you're just going to have to live with it we have medications and creams that can help with your symptoms but you may need to use them for the rest of your life now i don't know about you but my first reaction was to hell with that scenario long-term antibiotics together with the regular use of chemical face creams these are not components that contribute to good health quite the opposite i thought but then reality sinks in and it dawns on you that perhaps you have no option because anything's better than walking around with this red spotty face right at this point in the diagnosis i was experiencing those unavoidable feelings of despair that hit you when you feel so utterly helpless so yes initially i followed the advice of the so-called skin specialist to the letter i took my daily antibiotics and i tried a selection of medicated rosacea face creams and the end result of six months on these meds little to no visible improvement the only thing that appeared to have any positive effect was azelaic acid cream but if i had to put a number on it then i'd say a 10 improvement in most and that dreams things like hell so ultimately all these useless meds were tossed in the bin there had to be a better solution and i was damn well going to find it so here's what i did first i put my work and social life on hold nothing was going to distract me from my goal of once again having clear skin now research was an integral part of my work in life extension so the process of finding and analyzing relevant data was second nature to me i trawl endlessly through research data documenting my findings as i went however it quickly became apparent that something vital was missing from these studies not a single one took a holistic approach to dealing with rosacea it was more a case of let's see what effect therapy a has compared to therapy b compared to placebo so irrespective of whether a study was blind double blind or whatever they were all pretty much focused on finding some magic bullet that would cure the condition that in my opinion is absolutely the wrong approach it certainly hasn't been successful so far so logic dictated that an entirely different way of treating the condition was necessary i deduced if i was going to have any chance of eradicating my rosacea then i was going to have to attack it holistically i decided to focus all my efforts in optimizing my immune system and overall health by systematically addressing every possible factor that might in some way be compromising it and worsening my symptoms now up until this point i consider myself to be extremely healthy and i assumed therefore that my immune function must be close to optimal well time to rethink that one i thought if my immune system was in such good shape then why had i been afflicted with rosacea something had to be amiss and i was going to find it and fix it whatever it took rosacea causes depression there can be no argument about that just ask anyone who's ever suffered from the condition the big problem with this though is that depression suppresses immune function therefore if i was to have any real chance of success it was paramount now i focus on being positive and upbeat this really is key so here's the mindset and attitude that i employed first i accepted that every medical condition has a cause therefore every medical condition must be treatable sure we may not always know what the cause is or the appropriate treatment but simply the fact that we both must exist was all the motivation i needed to see this thing through following a full analysis of my research data i decided that my rosacea treatment protocol was to include six separate interventions and i would only proceed to add the next intervention one science sufficient time to evaluate the results of the previous one that way i'd know exactly which treatment responsible for which benefits firstly i stopped using all skin cleansing products except for a liquid soap antenna for babies it contained no chemicals caused me zero skin irritation and it didn't dry out my skin it's actually still my product of choice to this day and for anyone that might want to try it i've left a link in the description below using only this one cleansing product resulted in a noticeable reduction in redness if i ever felt like my skin needed hydrating then i'd simply apply organic aloe vera gel which proved to be very cooling and caused me no irritation next i stopped all sun exposure now i have to admit this was a hard one for me water sports on the beach had always been an important part of my life but for now at least they were gonna have to be put on hold because anything longer than a couple of minutes in the sun was causing increased facial redness but i should mention that i did take a vitamin d3 supplement in order to compensate for the lack of sun exposure following that i was next forced to address my regular sauna use i'd always been a big fan of the sauna due to its many proven health benefits but i now find myself suffering increased facial redness for several hours following each session so the only option was to knock on the head for now but a little spoiler alert i'm very happy to tell you nowadays i can use a sauna without problems and i can even enjoy sensible sun exposure without skin issues of any kind but more on that later i'd estimate that the overall benefit of these three simple changes was around a 20 improvement although i'd attribute this mainly to less frequent flare-ups as opposed to any major reductions in the symptoms themselves obtaining quality sleep each and every night is quite simply an integral part of achieving optimal health however it's probably the most common factor that most people could improve on and i was no exception before rosacea struck my bedtime would vary between 11 pm to 2 a.m depending on my work schedule or my social plans but i'd always awaken by alarm clock each morning at 7 00 am now i knew from experience that a minimum of seven hours sleep and a maximum of eight seem to provide me with optimal energy levels and mental function throughout the day so here's what i did i immediately set a fixed bedtime of 11 pm but allowed myself to awaken naturally between 6 and 7 am each morning that way i was always sleeping for just as long as my body required sleep quality is without doubt one of the strongest factors influencing both our immune system health and our mental function so i saw this approach as vital it took me less than a week to properly adapt to my new sleep schedule and within the first month i was already feeling and seeing the benefits energy levels had increased and my positive attitude was boosted by a further reduction in symptoms if i had to put a number on it then i'd say another 10 improvement let me also mention that in order to benefit my sleep patterns i use the popular supplement melatonin and for a full explanation regarding how to properly use this supplement and how to optimize your sleep quality then please see my melatonin video elsewhere on this channel next it was time to deal with those nasty little demodex mites now for anyone who hasn't heard of them demodex mites also known as face mites are parasites that live in our face and hair follicles there's two types of dermadex mite and they're both invisible to the naked eye demidex brevis live on the skin and demodex follicularum on hair but here's where i got a shock a little bit of research confirmed that people with rosacea could have up to ten times as many demodex mice on their skin as those without the condition i also learned that the mites become most active in the dark and that they have several stages in their life cycle after meeting on the surface of the skin they apparently go back into it to lay eggs before dying within the skin's layers after death the demidex corpses become liquid and decompose inside the skin when each of these tiny mice dies they release bacteria into the skin and those bacteria trigger an immune response that causes redness and inflammation now one bacteria in particular carried by deminex has been shown to stimulate an immune response in those with rosacea so it seemed pretty obvious to me that deminex must surely be contributing to my symptoms thankfully getting rid of my demonics problem was fairly straightforward a quick search on google revealed that pretty much anyone who's heard of a demodex mite also knows that tea tree oil kills them effectively so i got straight to it i mixed tea tree oil with emu oil in a 50 50 mix for application to my eyebrows and eyelashes and for application to my face and scalp i used a 30 tea tree 70 emu oil mix this ratio caused me no skin sensitivity issues whatsoever now the reason why i chose emu oil as a carrier off for tea tree is because it's non-comedogenic so won't cause clogged pores it's also highly hypoallergenic possesses anti-inflammatory properties and can penetrate deep through the skin's layers allowing it to effectively target demodex brevis every night before bed for seven days straight i applied the appropriate mix of oil to my face scalp eyebrows and eyelashes then in the morning i just showered and washed it off i experienced visible improvements and by the end of the seven day treatment my skin looked noticeably smoother and clearer following that i added five percent tea tree oil to my liquid soap for daily use now this protocol resulted in a further 20 percent improvement in my rosacea symptoms i was definitely making good progress now with a 50 overall improvement so far reports of certain foods causing rosacea flare-ups are commonplace and a quick search on google will provide a list of the most commonly reported problematic foods now at the time i wasn't really aware of consuming anything in particular that exacerbated my own rosacea other than perhaps alcohol which i'd already cut out however i still decided to try as an experiment i selected one food group at a time and totally eliminated that food from my diet for a period of four weeks in order to gauge any improvements but nothing appeared to make any noticeable difference not until this happened i eliminated dairy within three weeks the difference was significant after two months of being dairy free i could finally see light at the end of the tunnel i'd estimate that i was now 80 free of all rosacea symptoms three months into my dairy free experiment i decided to try reintroducing cheese to see what might happen within only a few days mild symptoms were returning which only served to confirm the effect that dairy was having on my condition my dietary strategy of needing to cure rosacea was based on optimizing my nutritional intake in a way that would also optimize my gut microbiome as we now know our microbiome is often referred to as our second brain influencing everything from our thoughts to our immune system health so in addition to carrying out the food group elimination tests i also made sure to avoid all processed foods primarily selecting whole foods in as close to the original form as possible now during this past decade my diet has been leaning towards vegan but i do occasionally still eat meat fish and eggs especially eating out if i were looking to put a label in my dietary practices then i'd probably classify myself as a nutritarian eating to satisfy nutrient requirements above all else nutritional supplements had always been an important part of my personal health program and i always considered a high quality daily multivitamin to be a necessity in order to cover any dietary deficiencies however i was now being forced to look at supplements from a slightly different perspective which supplements in particular would most benefit the appearance of my skin two supplements stood out the first supplement i chose was a peripheral antioxidant called astaxanthin it's a darkly pigmented substance which is produced by a particular type of microbe microalgae and it's the reason why salmon weeds are pink astaxanthin's powerful anti-inflammatory effects can also help calm the inflammation in rosacea and it's been shown to provide a useful degree of uv protection with its natural carotenoid pigments even adding a healthy color to the skin several studies have also shown beneficial effects in relation to wrinkles and skin moisture levels now i noticed the benefits of taking the supplement within a very short period of time and it continues to take it to this day one daily four milligram capsule is all is required and if you'd like to know more about this amazing supplement then you can watch my detailed astaxanthin video elsewhere on this channel the second supplement i chose to take was iodine and here was my reasoning i learned that iodine deficiency in the developed world had increased considerably over the last 40 years and i also noted the apparent steady increase in the rate of rosacea during the same period with the condition now afflicting over 400 million adults worldwide now i knew that iodine was highly important for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland which in turn has a direct influence over the appearance of our skin but what i hadn't been aware of are two reasons why i might be iodine deficient firstly i simply might not be getting enough iodine from my diet and secondly what i was ingesting might be getting blocked by three other elements from the same mineral family those being fluoride bromide and chlorine fluoride is often added to the water supply and it's also a common additive for most toothpaste products bromide is present in pesticides it's often used as a food additive in flower and you can even find it lurking in many personal care products and chlorine well it's present in drinking water swimming pools and jacuzzis now the big problem is this chlorine bromide and fluoride all compete for the same receptors that are used in the thyroid gland to capture iodine ultimately this can inhibit thyroid hormone production with the resultant low thyroid state but here's where it gets really interesting there's actually several other tissues that absorb and utilize iodine and these tissues include the skin so if i did have an iodine deficiency it certainly wasn't going to be benefiting my rosacea condition my solution was to immediately begin supplementing with six milligrams of iodine daily which research indicated was sufficient to ensure that my thyroid and affected tissues had the necessary levels available to function correctly i also made efforts to eliminate exposure to fluoride bromide and chlorine one month into my skin supplement protocol and my condition had continued to improve i'd estimate i was now 90 rosacea free and to be honest if the texture of my skin had just been a little bit better then i've considered myself to have returned to as my pre-rosacea state however i did have one last stage to go and this final stage turned out to be exactly what i needed in order to achieve my goal the final part of my six days protocol was to eliminate any chemical toxins stored within my fat cells we're all exposed to these toxins on a daily basis through the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat even the personal care products we put on our hair and skin the problem is that over time excesses of these toxins can accumulate in our fat cells and they can include such things as endocrine disruptors carcinogens even skin irritants so i figured that irrespective of whether or not they might be affecting my rosacea condition getting rid of them could only be a good thing my research indicated that the one and only truly effective protocol for eliminating chemical toxins stored within human fat cells was a detox developed by dr george ew this protocol was used by rescue workers suffering from toxic chemical inhalation following in 9 11 attacks and it proved to be highly effective shortly after dr you tweaked the protocol for use by the general adult population and is now extremely popular with anti-aging and life extension enthusiasts now initially i was a bit apprehensive about trying this detox because it does require the use of the sauna and the last thing i wanted to experience at this point was a setback however i needn't have worried it now appeared at the extreme heat of the sauna was no longer having any negative effect whatsoever on my rosacea condition quite the opposite in fact with every sauna detox session my skin was becoming closer to 100 percent clear now i'm not going to spend time here describing doctor use detox rather i'll direct you to a detailed video i made in the subject elsewhere on this channel but what i will tell you right now is this the results of this detox with regard to your overall health and the appearance of your skin can be truly transformational to this day i still repeat doctor use sonnet detox once a month in order to prevent any further toxin build up and i still take regular saunas several times a week so that was my sixth stage rosacea protocol in a nutshell to the best of my knowledge those who have tried it have all had worthwhile results and some have even experienced a complete and permanent reversal of their symptoms fast forward to 2022 i'm still 100 rosacea free and have been for the past 12 years it appears that my skin together with those underlying factors that were causing my rosacea have now fully reverted to their pre-rosacea state but the most remarkable change for me is that sunshine saunas alcohol stress even berry appear to no longer pose any threat to my clear skin however i would point out that for health reasons i choose to rarely consume dairy or alcohol the bottom line is this if you want to effectively deal with your rosacea condition then it really does require a totally holistic approach in reality this applies not only to rosacea but to our health in general perhaps if our doctors were better educated in these facts then they wouldn't be so hasty in prescribing medications because there's generally far more effective routes to achieving good health than popping pills i really do wish you the very best of luck in dealing with your rosacea condition and i'd love to hear your comments regarding your progress in dealing with this dramatic affliction the sharing of such information can only serve to benefit us all i'm wrecker black many thanks for watching and if you enjoyed this presentation then please like subscribe and comment it really does help the channel grow and as always take care be healthy and see you again soon [Music]",

massive thank you for watching the rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 skincare journey as well as the skincare\u00a0\nroutine video a lot of you came back saying that\u00a0\u00a0 you actually found that video really useful and\u00a0\nalso the skincare routine very effective i'm so\u00a0\u00a0 glad to hear that and that is the whole purpose of\u00a0\nthat video i have experienced rosacea first hand\u00a0\u00a0 and i know exactly how it feels to experience\u00a0\nrosacea on today's video as you can tell by the\u00a0\u00a0 title i'm going to talk about the foods to avoid\u00a0\nas well as the foods to eat for rosacea i hope you\u00a0\u00a0 find this video useful and if this is your first\u00a0\ntime here on my channel welcome my name is sarita\u00a0\u00a0 i mostly do like fashion videos skincare lifestyle\u00a0\nvlogs and i also talk about money if that is the\u00a0\u00a0 sort of content you like then please don't forget\u00a0\nto subscribe my channel i love to have you here\u00a0\u00a0 before i start this video i want to give you like\u00a0\na little bit of a history about my skin basically\u00a0\u00a0 i started suffering from rosacea in my 20s it\u00a0\nwas actually redness fast then it got worse and\u00a0\u00a0 it turned out to be acne rosacea apart from my\u00a0\nforehead my entire face was full of acne redness\u00a0\u00a0 and flakiness at one point i really struggled to\u00a0\nopen my mouth because i had like acne as well as\u00a0\u00a0 dryness all over my mouth especially on the corner\u00a0\nso when i would try to eat something it would hurt\u00a0\u00a0 a lot that is how worst my skin was at the moment\u00a0\nthis is the best my skin has been i'm wearing a\u00a0\u00a0 little bit of makeup but if you are interested to\u00a0\nwatch how i cleared my skin then i'll put a video\u00a0\u00a0 link up here as well as on my description box\u00a0\nso that you guys can go and watch that later it\u00a0\u00a0 has been a long journey to get where i am today\u00a0\nwith my skin but i'm really happy at the moment\u00a0\u00a0 and also i cleared my skin without any medication\u00a0\nbefore i used to rely a lot on medication which\u00a0\u00a0 was prescribed by doctors and dermatologists\u00a0\nhowever at the end i managed to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 without medication by myself which i'm really\u00a0\nproud of so let's talk about the relationship\u00a0\u00a0 of food with rosacea rosacea as we all know is\u00a0\nnot curable however it can be managed by diet as\u00a0\u00a0 well there are many foods that can trigger rosacea\u00a0\nparticularly the food that contains high level of\u00a0\u00a0 acid spice and sugary stuff i went to see quite\u00a0\na lot of dermatologists but they were heavily\u00a0\u00a0 focused on medication rather than on the diet\u00a0\ni was given all sorts of ointment to put on my\u00a0\u00a0 face i was only once recommended antibiotics\u00a0\nwhich i had for nearly two months only like\u00a0\u00a0 one dermatologist told me i should be avoiding\u00a0\nspicy food and sugary stuff hence the reason i\u00a0\u00a0 never really focused much on diet at first when it\u00a0\nstarted i was eating everything later through my\u00a0\u00a0 research i found out there is a direct correlation\u00a0\nbetween food and rosacea also not just by research\u00a0\u00a0 actually i found it myself there were\u00a0\ncertain foods that would trigger my rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 straight away like red one as soon as i had\u00a0\nred wine or even white wine would flush my skin\u00a0\u00a0 and make it red i'm not a drinker i only socially\u00a0\ndrink everybody used to ask me like are you all\u00a0\u00a0 right like what's going on with your face because\u00a0\nas soon as i had drank wine you could see the\u00a0\u00a0 effects of wine straightaways hence people were\u00a0\nlike really concerned about it which i don't\u00a0\u00a0 blame them because a lot of people have\u00a0\nno knowledge about rosacea i didn't have\u00a0\u00a0 knowledge about rosacea before i actually suffered\u00a0\nmyself the food triggers for rosacea varies from\u00a0\u00a0 person to person i'm going to talk about firstly\u00a0\nabout the list of food that you should be avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 and then next what i'll do is i'll talk about\u00a0\nthe food that really helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 so the first one is high acid vegetables yes\u00a0\nwe all think veg is good for us however when\u00a0\u00a0 it comes to rosacea there are certain foods you\u00a0\nshould be avoiding like tomatoes hot peppers onion\u00a0\u00a0 radish this is spinach but i didn't avoid spinach\u00a0\nactually i feel like spinach works well for my\u00a0\u00a0 skin it comes down my skin you have to do quite a\u00a0\nlot of trial test out all the food basically when\u00a0\u00a0 it comes to drink alcohol like gene wine even bear\u00a0\nhot coffee another one is the food that release\u00a0\u00a0 histamine when i say histamine it is citrus foods\u00a0\nlike oranges lemon etc however again i've actually\u00a0\u00a0 not avoided them it works really well for my skin\u00a0\nnext one is dairy products like milk cheese yogurt\u00a0\u00a0 i cut dairy out of my diet and i'll tell you\u00a0\nlater what happened another one is the last one\u00a0\u00a0 high level of refined or concentrated sugar and\u00a0\nsodium like processed food to sum up basically we\u00a0\u00a0 should be avoiding food that actually heat up our\u00a0\nbody spike blood sugar levels that will contribute\u00a0\u00a0 towards facial redness and triggers rosacea so\u00a0\nnow let's talk about what sorts of foods i avoided\u00a0\u00a0 basically i did quite a lot of trial i went to see\u00a0\nactually chinese like herbal medicine practitioner\u00a0\u00a0 which you can find in all the local town they have\u00a0\nlike this little store i went to see them they\u00a0\u00a0 took like a strand of my hair cut this off and\u00a0\nsent it to lab for test they wanted to check my\u00a0\u00a0 food allergy i have no food allergy at all after a\u00a0\ncouple of days my result came back and i was given\u00a0\u00a0 this sheet where there was like a tick mark of\u00a0\nfoods this is gonna sound so crazy but most of\u00a0\u00a0 the stuff i should be avoiding like garlic ginger\u00a0\nonion peppers chocolates fizzy drinks there were a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of foods that came back saying i should be\u00a0\navoiding which i can't remember off top of my\u00a0\u00a0 head at the moment but that is some of the food\u00a0\nthat i was told to avoid i was in shock after\u00a0\u00a0 that results came if i had gone by that sheet then\u00a0\nobviously i would have to have plain bland food\u00a0\u00a0 and i actually did avoid fizzy drinks and this\u00a0\nstuff they have listed like garlic ginger but\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't see much difference i did it for about\u00a0\na month and i didn't see any difference so at the\u00a0\u00a0 end i started eating garlic onion fizzy drinks\u00a0\nand then also like chocolates then what i decided\u00a0\u00a0 to do was i decided to write a food diary which\u00a0\nhelped me a lot i highly recommend you guys to\u00a0\u00a0 do a food diary which will help you to understand\u00a0\nwhich food is triggering rosacea so i wrote a food\u00a0\u00a0 diary and i was writing each day what i ate and\u00a0\nwhen i had flare up basically i understood from\u00a0\u00a0 my diary spicy food hot foods were triggering my\u00a0\nrosacea as well as drink wise i found out coffee\u00a0\u00a0 was triggering my rosacea at that point i\u00a0\nused to drink like four to five cups of coffee\u00a0\u00a0 in a day other one was wine particularly red wine\u00a0\ni always started avoiding spicy food which helped\u00a0\u00a0 me a lot i saw a massive difference in my skin\u00a0\nactually when i started to avoid spicy food and\u00a0\u00a0 being an asian it is so hard to avoid spicy food\u00a0\nbecause we grew up eating spicy food even today\u00a0\u00a0 i only occasionally eat spicy food after eating\u00a0\nspicy food what used to happen was i could feel\u00a0\u00a0 my body heat up and then the skin flushing would\u00a0\nhappen like i would have redness all over my face\u00a0\u00a0 apart from my forehead so straight away i could\u00a0\nfeel it was affecting me hence i stopped spicy\u00a0\u00a0 food i also did avoid dairy i thought it\u00a0\nwould calm down my acne as well as redness\u00a0\u00a0 maybe it's the dairy that's affecting my rosacea\u00a0\nafter a while i realized it was not the dairy\u00a0\u00a0 actually when i was eating yogurt it was helping\u00a0\nmy skin to calm down and yogurts we all know it\u00a0\u00a0 has like good bacteria it is probiotic which is\u00a0\nlike good for gut health at this point i want to\u00a0\u00a0 mention about the gut health as well if you have a\u00a0\ngood good as well that helps you to calm your skin\u00a0\u00a0 your rosacea i don't drink milk or have a cheese\u00a0\ni only have cheese with pizza i do have yogurt\u00a0\u00a0 just for my good health i realized dairy wasn't\u00a0\naffecting my skin also you guys know like i put\u00a0\u00a0 yogurt on my skin with green tea which actually\u00a0\nreally helped to calm my skin and yogurt has\u00a0\u00a0 got lactic acid which removes all the dead skin\u00a0\ncells from the top layer i talked in depth about\u00a0\u00a0 this homemade marks on my recent videos i'll\u00a0\nleave the link here as well as i'll leave the\u00a0\u00a0 link down below as usual next one i did a trial\u00a0\nwas sugary food so especially i was mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate so i just gave up chocolates\u00a0\ndidn't see much difference to be honest\u00a0\u00a0 until this day i eat chocolates occasionally\u00a0\nespecially i prefer dark chocolates because it\u00a0\u00a0 is apparently good for your skin when it comes to\u00a0\nhot drinks i strictly avoided coffee i only have\u00a0\u00a0 coffee once in the morning that's it instead of\u00a0\nhaving a lot of coffee i actually started drinking\u00a0\u00a0 green tea with mint which i again talked about\u00a0\non my last video so i would not touch on that\u00a0\u00a0 and that had to come my skin a lot the last one\u00a0\nwas spinach spinach actually didn't affect my\u00a0\u00a0 skin a lot i was actually drinking a spinach juice\u00a0\nas well as spinach salad i actually didn't avoid\u00a0\u00a0 spinach i have still included that in my diet\u00a0\nbasically i did a lot of trial with food and\u00a0\u00a0 wrote a food diary which helped me to understand\u00a0\nwhich food was actually affecting me so strictly i\u00a0\u00a0 avoided spicy food reduce the intake of coffee and\u00a0\nwine i drink wine now but only very occasionally\u00a0\u00a0 now i'm gonna move on to what foods to eat to calm\u00a0\nyour rosacea you should be eating like 25 to 35\u00a0\u00a0 fresh veg another 25 to 35 protein and then rest\u00a0\nis grains when it comes to veg eat high water\u00a0\u00a0 content veg avoid high acid veg protein you can\u00a0\neat like chicken and all the food that has protein\u00a0\u00a0 in it and when it comes to grains you can have\u00a0\nlentils rice i try to stick to this person taste\u00a0\u00a0 also try food with antioxidants which is good\u00a0\nfor your skin overall as well as it is great for\u00a0\u00a0 anti-aging so when it comes to rosacea like there\u00a0\nare a lot of anti-aging stuff we can't put on our\u00a0\u00a0 face because it triggers our rosacea i personally\u00a0\ndon't use any anti-aging creams because i focus\u00a0\u00a0 more on calming my skin down and hydration that's\u00a0\nthe reason why i don't use anti-aging products\u00a0\u00a0 if you don't use anti-aging products like i\u00a0\ndo then definitely include antioxidants like\u00a0\u00a0 blueberries strawberries blackberries etc in your\u00a0\nfood also another thing i would say to include is\u00a0\u00a0 probiotics which i mentioned earlier and fermented\u00a0\nfood which is really good for good i eat lots of\u00a0\u00a0 probiotics and fermented food like kimchi and\u00a0\nfermented like spinach which we call gunruk which\u00a0\u00a0 is very traditional food from nepal i'm originally\u00a0\nfrom nepal if you guys don't know and i eat a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of yogurts and i also put a lot of yogurt on my\u00a0\nface at least twice a week also i forgot to touch\u00a0\u00a0 on veg like what type of high content water veg\u00a0\nyou should have like cucumber asparagus broccoli\u00a0\u00a0 celery lettuce pumpkin so you can have all those\u00a0\nhigh water content food also salmon is great for\u00a0\u00a0 someone who suffers from rosacea definitely\u00a0\nincludes salmon i absolutely love salmon i'm\u00a0\u00a0 a big fan of salmon actually it has got omega-3\u00a0\nwhich is anti-inflammatory decreases redness so\u00a0\u00a0 that is the foods you need to add in your diet\u00a0\ntry not to have too much junk food i do eat junk\u00a0\u00a0 food i have not avoided or have a total ban on\u00a0\njunk food i do like to treat myself sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 with those sort of food as well but overall i try\u00a0\nto eat more veg protein and then grains let's sum\u00a0\u00a0 this video up actually because i've given you\u00a0\nso much information and i don't want you to be\u00a0\u00a0 confused i strictly avoided spicy food but reduce\u00a0\nthe intake of coffee and replaced it with green\u00a0\u00a0 tea and mint i try to eat like high water content\u00a0\nveg probiotics and fermented food to maintain my\u00a0\u00a0 gut health i feel like when my gut is not great i\u00a0\ncan see that on my skin as well avoiding couple of\u00a0\u00a0 foods actually really helped me to clear my skin i\u00a0\nwould highly recommend you guys to do a food diary\u00a0\u00a0 do a trial of different food i mentioned and see\u00a0\nwhich one triggers you and which one doesn't and\u00a0\u00a0 you can decide which one to include and which one\u00a0\nnot to include in your diet i hope this video was\u00a0\u00a0 useful for you please do like comment and\u00a0\nsubscribe my channel if there is any video\u00a0\u00a0 request then please do let me know and i'll\u00a0\nsee you guys very soon till then take care bye",

        "published_at": "2023-01-13T00:35:23Z",
        "transcript": "I talk a lot about skin on a regular basis on my channel but mostly about what I'm applying to my face to try and get it to behave and not have breakouts but one of the other parts of this is also making sure we're getting everything we need internally to help the skin actually reflect a healthy glow and help heal especially especially when you have skin issues and skin problems if I don't do these things I notice a big difference maybe about a week or two weeks later so I know it's working the first thing I do when I wake up is have a glass of water every single day no matter what it definitely just kick-starts the hydration you want to get going get something in there because you can sleep in probably a little bit dehydrated when you wake up probably feel a little bit groggy just gonna get some hydration into your system on other days I kick it up a notch and add green juice powder it's a really dark green clumpy mixture and I just put about a fourth a teaspoon into my a cup and also because it tastes pretty much like nothing but has like a slight earthy taste not a strong taste at all I like to add a little bit of davia powder I love this one that is either lemon or it's like a lemon Strawberry mix also on days when I'm going to the gym I do the electrolyte powder it makes me feel a bit more awake especially when I'm going to the gym I feel a bit more alert and I know that it's helping to detox and cleanse my livers to have the glowiest healthiest skin is to make sure your liver is being cleansed and detoxed also in the morning I like to take my apple cider vinegar this version has Ginger cinnamon and cayenne pepper in it and after taking this for a few weeks I realized it helped a lot of inflammation that I had on one of my Knuckles it made the pain basically entirely go away that is one of the keys here if you have inflammation in your body it's going to hit your skin so with breakouts and with redness and rosacea which I have as well this is some something I want to attack and this product has helped enormously I've been taking it for about nine months now I take two a day no matter what if I skip it after about a week or so I'll notice the pain comes back in my hand which means anywhere else in my body where there's inflammation that's coming back as well so this is one item I love and I take no matter what every single day I also take a multivitamin no matter what as well and I hate swallowing pills so much so if I have a gummy which the Alive Brand does have it's easier for me to take if you can take a multivitamin without actually doing the gummy part then keep at it it's probably the best thing for you so this is just really like it tastes like eating candy I take two a day one of the other supplements that I make sure to take and it really helps support my skin my hair my nails is this essential enzyme supplement I take this after I eat one of them if I'm having a meal that has a lot of complex carbohydrates or a mixture of a lot of different things in there I'm going to take too so if I'm having a salad I'll just take one and if it's something that involves bread or meat or dairy if I'm eating dairy I'll take a couple of these and what I'm going for here is to make sure that this helps my digestion so I'm getting all the essential minerals and supplemental form of vitamins into my system so it's going back into my skin and hair and nails and making sure that I have every nutrient that I need to help support my skin and the healing process and also to make sure I'm glowing and healthy especially if you eat a salad or fruit or vegetables those greens you I want to make sure that they are fully digested to the max so I can benefit entirely from those nutrients there are two food items that I make sure I have every single day and one of them is two Brazil nuts Brazil nuts actually help fight acne so I make sure I have two full Brazil nuts they have so many nutrients to help your body and your hair and your skin and your nails but especially for helping you fight acne I love this nut so much I just buy a bag of them and to make sure I have them close by so I remember to grab too I think of them as one of my supplements as well walnuts are something that I make sure I eat every single day as well I eat about a fourth of a cup a day these are going to help with inflammation which is something you're working on if you're trying to avoid acne and trying to heal acne it's also going to help with rosacea because they have natural omega-3 at fatty acids they're going to help with that all-around healthy look to your hair skin and Nails this is the lemon drink that I drink once a day you're taking the whole entire lemon including the skin and the seeds everything and blending that into the blender and I also have ginger in there I get big chunks of Ginger and slice them up and freeze those as well because this is really tart you're going to want to soften that tartness with either Stevia or blueberries if you don't want to use blueberries or don't have any I suggest using a kiwi because kiwi has so many nutrients in it that are wonderful for your skin it's so refreshing and this is going to help your skin be really really glowy try it for a week you may notice a huge difference I really recommend giving it a try if you're used to seeing my Channel or any of the videos that I've made or shorts you're probably used to seeing me drinking green tea and talking about Green Tea this is my favorite it's earl gray green tea from Bigelow I drink it pretty much two or three times a day two or three cups a day in the summer I don't like a hot drink so I end up drinking it once a day or not at all I'm gonna tell you when I don't drink it in the summer within a week I notice a huge difference in my skin my skin stops being glowy it feels a little bit there's like a missing kind of plumpness to it I used to drink the black tea so so much and once I learned that green tea would help support my skin and the issues I have especially with rosacea I was like let's try it and I just fell in love and it is something I am not going to want to ever live without because I do notice a huge difference in the glowiness and healthiness of my skin and that's what this is all about I want my skin to feel supported and healthy and glowy and I want the same for you so if there's anything that you take internally that helps support your skin if you have acne rosacea especially those two things let me know what's going on with you and if you have anything that helps you a lot I want to know tell the people let us all know foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Burke here in this video we're gonna talk about rosacea okay rosacea is a condition where you have these red and cheeks could be in the forehead the chin pimples it looks like it's like a spider vein broken blood vessels all right now if you look this up in the medical literature you're gonna find it's an unknown cause right so let's talk about some common factors relating to rosacea okay number one a lot of women get it after menopause okay what does that mean well the adrenal gland backs up the ovaries during menopause and the adrenal glands store a lot of the vitamin C in the body and vitamin C deficiency you have all sorts of issues with bleeding gums spider veins vascular issues weakness within the arteries leaky gut because vitamin C supports the integrity of the collagen so you can have a vitamin C deficiency coming from an adrenal weakness okay that's number one number two medically it's treated with antibiotics and there's some results with that so there has to be some type of microbial issue going on so the other medication you use is an anti-inflammatory so we have microbes and inflammation guess what the adrenal controls the white blood cells so that does control the immune system and it produces most of the anti-inflammatories in your body as well like prednisone is a type of cortisol that's to be used for inflammation a lot of women get rosacea after mold exposure which again is some microbe that inactivates the white blood cell so again we have an immune issue that's underlying things there's also higher incidence of mites and small intestine bacterial overgrowth so we have this microbial imbalance in your gut which again that's where a lot of your immune system is okay so I believe that it's a combination between an immune weakness caused by some micro probably mold in combination with weak adrenals okay so here's the two things I'm going to recommend and that's them okay you can get this anywhere online or a health food store which is a real good anti-inflammatory and grapefruit seed extract which is one of the best anti mult antifungal antibacterial natural things that you can take so thank you so much for watching and your comments below hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we'll send you a report",

        "transcript": "this is me before when i had rosacea this is me now when i don't have resistance you're now gonna tell me that rosacea is not curable this is total bs because i did it i am the powerful person that i can cure anything anything and yes i did the same thing with rosacea i had rosacea for a year and i was doing a lot of research guys when you get something going on with your health you know something is wrong and i know that there is an answer to get rid of that crap that i had in my life now i am not a doctor telling you straight away i am aesthetician i have my skincare brand and i was like what the heck is going on with my skin so i took my power it took my time i took my brain and researched and i have done a lot of research now this is what worked for me it does not mean that the same thing is going to work for you i highly highly recommend to do your own research rosacea is a chronic skin issue that is not true even though every single doctor in the world gonna tell you that this is true this is absolutely not true rosacea is not a skin issue rosacea is inflammation in your gut issue and it might be in the entire body inflammation so what happened when i started having rosacea and it came gradually not like right away one day i woke up and my skin is red it came like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly but with that i had other issues as well in my body and i'm very very good to listen to my body because i only had in the past diabetes hashimoto's surgeon i have obviously got all this crap going on with my health i overcame that everything is in remission i'm super happy or super healthy and i realized that rosacea is one of those outwomen disorders when i went to my tyra doctor i go to endocrinologist once a year because i have a history of hashimoto's i have to go keep checking my thyroid levels all the time and the rust last time when i talked to her she's like do you know rosacea is actually autoimmune disorder which nobody is actually talking about but i'm happy that my um doctor endocrinologist she's a little bit more towards on the holistic side so i started digging in um you know in all the articles research done about rosacea and there's a lot of confusing information a lot of contradictory contradiction you know against one another and this is like i was like lost and you know what when you're lost when there is information this is bad this is good this is good basically you can find the same information one article where you're gonna say this actually works and another article gonna say this is not working so what happens when you have this going on one saying one another saying another thing you actually test it and try on your body and this is what actually worked for me by the way all the medical articles everything i'm gonna put down below do your own research i highly highly recommend do your own research before you start doing what i did and so long story short rosacea is basically inflammatory disease condition that you can actually heal it or at least you can put it in remission you can become friends with that and don't be afraid it's actually curable i have situations where i cried and i thought what the heck is going on with my skin i cried i didn't want to film youtube videos i am youtuber i am influencer i am aesthetician and i own skincare brand can you believe can you imagine how much pressure i have on my shoulders i almost got depressed because i had rotation where i am representation of my brand i'm always presenting my skincare brand with my skin right i am obsessed about micro needlings their broilers and everything and i was like one day i can't do anything because main point of me is promoting my products right with having a nice skin and then i realized you know that rosacea is not the skin issue rosacea is the issue over there probiotics probiotics are good bacteria for your gut i use at this moment two different probiotics i always rotate i never use the same one i highly highly recommend to rotate any kind of supplements um probiotics or detox supplements that you taking taking at all times um again i'm telling you i am not a doctor this is what works for me don't take my recommendations seriously without doing your own research sakura might well already works very very well with candida i double this dose even you're supposed to take one pill i double i did two because when something happens rosacea is basically either some sort of pathogenic issue either you have parasites bacteria virus any kind of mold uh mercury whatever any kind of pathogens we don't know what we don't know right um studies also been uh showing that uh people with rosacea don't remember percentage but it's quite high above 70 percent people with rosacea have h pylori in gut that's mean that we have h pylori bacteria um and which is not good bacteria it can destroy our gut system and that affects our skin basically our skin is a mirror what's happening in the gut there is a correlation there is always relation your gut and the skin uh second some probiotics that i was taking this is ladybugs this is from walgreens just simply a lot of good lactobacillus different kind of bacteria i also double the dose of this so basically i was taking three to four pills of probiotics nothing is going to happen you're not going to overdose probiotics if you're taking double the dose uh this is what you want when you have a bacteria and of course this is not going to heal this is not going to cure but this has a huge impact another supplement that right now is bad on amazon and hopefully they're not going to ban my video this is not and acetylchycene nike is basically building antioxidants in your body short short version what is snack you can do your own research with a snack another product that helped me a lot i was listening to one really really great um a scientist that done a lot of research about rosacea he's like phd dermatologist he's some sort of like i had i don't remember the name i just listened to him and he mentioned this product nicotinamide riboside chloride or um this is from true niagara basically now which is strengthens our immunity basically they have fuel oxidation in the body we all have oxidative stress right we all have sort of like oxidation in the body with the age when we're aging we are not getting younger our cells is not getting younger we're getting only older and our cells age like when you look in the mirror you only see wrinkles right you you have a pain getting older 50 60 70 80 years old whatever even some people start getting sick much earlier like i started be sick at the age of 30. so i have a little bit of knowledge just to see guys i'm all about research i'm doing about research and reading book this is my favorite the health bible book the hands down this is what heal me what the hell means for those who are interested gotten psychology syndrome how god actually affects our psychological issues and any kind of issues in life oh my god guys i will go for hours and hours talking about the health how important is to actually start with him start with what you eat and stuff like this um so this one it is i think that helped me really really really a lot i started seeing differences right away and everything what i'm talking about more or less can apply not only rosacea sensitive skin acne skin any kind of other chronic skin issues and now let's go to um it's not a supplement it's actually um something that i did for myself it is colonics that helped me really really a lot and i'm not gonna go into diets you know guys i'm super super healthy i'm not eating any crap sugars dairy and gluten and stuff like this i am talking about right now about supplementations because i think that had a huge the biggest impact in my uh journey healing rosacea so colonics is a colon hydrotherapy where actually i cannot insert small footage when i did um it's basically cleaning your bowels doing like sort of like hey you can do enema at home but that's like professionally done by a colon hydrotherapist a procedure that you cleanse your bowels they put a little thing in your butthole and like basically filling up with the water and that water when it comes out it comes out all the bacteria basically this is a very natural way to detox your body i just did colonies at this amazing place thank you ladies the best the best massage and thank you for coming we appreciate you so much thank you some of you actually one person today or yesterday texted me hey jin i love your pager on instagram and stuff like this but i would like you not to post anything related with colonics i'm sorry but i'm standing for this i know it works it worked for me and if you don't like it if you never tried and you don't have any like serious health issues you can judge me as much as i want i'm standing for what worked for me and i know what for other people because i follow other people that heal themselves from chronic really chronic bad uh health issues and i'm doing myself the same thing and is helping me and if it's helping me i'm gonna stand for this stuff and i will promote this as soon as this is legal i have a right to speak up and i have a right to help people and i know some of you already thanking me and saying i i love when i receive messages hey jin thank you so much for this book remain recommendation i have at least 20 or 30 people that they say thank you jen for recommending this book they are healing i love when people can heal i love when people can feel better i just have this insane passion in my heart to help people because i know how bad feels when you're freaking sick when you're sick you don't want to do anything and when you heal you're just like you get your power back you can live it you can enjoy life i will always stand for what i believe and i believe in animal a lot something that i have not talked much and something that i was i'm gonna be honest i was kind of you know against it it's one sort of type of antibiotics that helped me with rotation i knew i had the research done the metro dinosaur i knew topically works with rosacea and i was always against any kind of antibiotic steroids something not natural to the human body but here is the thing um when you are actually loaded with a lot of oxidative stuff in your body when you have a lot of pathogens bacteria viruses and stuff like this and nothing really helps or maybe i didn't do enough then i was like you know what i'm gonna try antibiotics and funny story quick quick story actually i basically took those antibiotics not for rosacea reason i knew that metronidazole actually gel topical gel works for rosacea but i knew rosacea is actually internal so what happened actually one day i woke up and i had uh bacterial vaginosis bv and it was so bad that any kind of natural remedies didn't work for me so i went to my guy you know he's like you need metronidazole and stuff like this and you know i started taking this because when you have bacterial vaginosis you know the smell is not really pleasant and like i'm gonna do whatever it takes because i have to change my underwear five times a day and i cannot go in the public place because the smell is that bad and you know it's kind of weird sharing with you this but this is true this is what we women face every day you know in our lives and that's okay i'm no different than you right so this is what happened i started taking those antibiotics i did the research and the more i did research before i put something on my skin or on my body in my mouth i actually do research the more research i did the more i realized that metronidazole zoell at beauty is actually helping with rashes internally so it is funny story how i'm sharing actually how i got antibiotics for rosacea to cumulation heal rosacea but it wasn't kind of intentionally so sometimes you know things happen in life because it's supposed to happen and i think for example i believe that i don't know god or universe wherever you believe that sending me sometimes struggles so i can actually share with you i can overcome this the same was with hashimoto's and diabetes i can actually overcome this and i actually can share that information to you and can help some of you even if it's going to be just one person that i'm going to be helping that's a lot imagine if one person in the world and how many eight billion people if just one person helped to somebody else every day we all will make this planet a better place to live right so i hope this video helps let me know down in the comments below what helped you if you have any chronic health issue especially skin issues let
