        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments.

        "transcript": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition\u00a0\nthat usually affects the face. Its often mistaken\u00a0\u00a0 for acne, eczema, or an even allergic skin\u00a0\nreaction. It causes redness and visible blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels in your face and sometimes produces\u00a0\nsmall red, pus filled bumps that flare up for\u00a0\u00a0 weeks to months, disappear and reappear when\u00a0\nyou least expect. In this video, im going to\u00a0\u00a0 go over what rosacea is, what causes it, how\u00a0\nto treat rosacea, and 1 very important tip you\u00a0\u00a0 dont want to miss out on when it comes to\u00a0\npreventing it,, so stay tuned till the end.\u00a0 Hi guys, yaseen arsalan, media pharmacist here on\u00a0\nyoutube, this week's video is on rosacea. Smash\u00a0\u00a0 the like button below NOW, as there is a ton\u00a0\nof useful information in here, that I know you\u00a0\u00a0 can benefit from. Also, it helps others find this\u00a0\nvideo as well, iso we can beat rosacea together.\u00a0 Rosacea affects more than 16 million Americans,\u00a0\nwhich is another reason why i wanted to make this\u00a0\u00a0 video. To hopefully point you in the direction\u00a0\nwhen it comes to understanding managing rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and when to let your doctor know. And although,\u00a0\nthe cause of rosacea is still unknown, experts\u00a0\u00a0 believe that the following factors may contribute:\u00a0\nHot drinks and spicy foods,Red wine, alcoholic\u00a0\u00a0 beverages, Temperature extremes, like going\u00a0\nfrom really cold to really hot or vice versa,\u00a0\u00a0 saunas, sunlight or wind, emotions, and even\u00a0\nvarious cosmetic products. Rosacea is more\u00a0\u00a0 common in females than males, and it usually\u00a0\ndevelops after the age of 30. And there is 4\u00a0\u00a0 types you should know of. You have ocular rosacea,\u00a0\nwhich includes eye redness and irritation and\u00a0\u00a0 swollen eyelids. Papulopustular rosacea, which\u00a0\nincludes flushing, swelling, and breakouts that\u00a0\u00a0 resemble acne. Erythemato-telangi-ectatic\u00a0\nrosacea which includes skin discoloration,\u00a0\u00a0 flushing, and visible blood vessels referred to\u00a0\nas spider veins, which you may have heard of. And\u00a0\u00a0 lastly, phymatous rosacea: which leads to bumpy\u00a0\nskin, often accompanied with an enlargement of the\u00a0\u00a0 nose and spider veins can be present too. Although\u00a0\nNo specific test is used to diagnose rosacea. You\u00a0\u00a0 should let your doctor know of the history of\u00a0\nyour symptoms so they can look at your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and rule out other conditions that\u00a0\ncould exist, such as psoriasis,\u00a0\u00a0 eczema, or lupus as the signs and symptoms may\u00a0\nlook alike. If your symptoms involve your eyes,\u00a0\u00a0 your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist\u00a0\n(ophthalmologist) for further evaluation.\u00a0 Now lets look at some treatment option and what\u00a0\ncan you do. Before I go into home remedies you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out starting today, its best to\u00a0\nlet your doctor know of your condition,\u00a0\u00a0 as they most likely will recommend topical\u00a0\nproducts that reduce redness, and can possibly\u00a0\u00a0 be more advantageous, especially if you haven\u2019t\u00a0\ntried them out before. Brimonidine or (Mirvaso)\u00a0\u00a0 and oxymetazoline or (Rhofade) reduce redness\u00a0\nby constricting blood vessels and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 results within 12 hours after use. The\u00a0\neffect on the blood vessels is temporary,\u00a0\u00a0 so the medication needs to be applied regularly to\u00a0\nmaintain improvements. Other topical products have\u00a0\u00a0 less effect on the redness but help control\u00a0\nthe pimples of mild rosacea.These include\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid and metronidazole and take up to\u00a0\n6 weeks to show improvement. Your doctor may\u00a0\u00a0 also prescribe antibiotic such as doxycycline or\u00a0\nOracea for moderate to severe rosacea with bumps\u00a0\u00a0 and pimples. ANd if if your rosacea is severe\u00a0\nand nothing else helps, your doctor may suggest\u00a0\u00a0 isotretinoin which is a powerful oral acne drug\u00a0\nthat also helps clear up acne like lesions of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea or can recommend Laser therapy and other\u00a0\nlight-based therapies to help reduce all that\u00a0\u00a0 redness. Now lets look at what you can do until\u00a0\nthen. There are 5 things you can starting now.\u00a0 #1: Identify and avoid triggers. Pay\u00a0\nattention to what tends to flare you up\u00a0\u00a0 and do your best to avoid them. For some that may\u00a0\nbe avoiding certain foods, hot drinks, alcohol,\u00a0\u00a0 and spicy foods. Eating foods that contain\u00a0\nthe compound cinnamaldehyde, such as cinnamon,\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate, tomatoes, and citrus may be culprits\u00a0\nas well. So pay attention to food triggers.\u00a0 #2 Protect your face. You want to make sure\u00a0\nthat if your exposed to the sun for long\u00a0\u00a0 periods of time, that you Use a broad-spectrum\u00a0\nsunscreen \u2014 which blocks both uv A and uv B\u00a0\u00a0 rays \u2014 with an SPF of 30 or higher. Because\u00a0\nso many sunscreens contain chemicals that can\u00a0\u00a0 be absorbed and cause irritation like octinoxate,\u00a0\noctosalate, or octocrylene you want to avoid these\u00a0\u00a0 chemical sunscreens and opt for a physical one\u00a0\nlike zinc oxide. I left one that i commend in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, so definitely check that out.\u00a0\nAlso on that note, if you live a colder climate:\u00a0\u00a0 try to cover your face in cold weather as this\u00a0\nis known to trigger rosacea as well. #3 Treat\u00a0\u00a0 your skin gently. Don't rub or touch your face\u00a0\nexcessively. Use a nonsoap cleanser and moisturize\u00a0\u00a0 frequently. Avoid products that contain alcohol\u00a0\nor other skin irritants or comedogenic products\u00a0\u00a0 that block the oil and sweat gland openings. I\u00a0\nleft more information on that below too, so check\u00a0\u00a0 that out. #4. clean your eyelids at least once\u00a0\na day if you have blepharitis, otherwise known\u00a0\u00a0 as an eyelid inflammation occurring at the base\u00a0\nof the eyelid. And if youre unsure that you do,\u00a0\u00a0 have your doctor examine your eyelids. Using a\u00a0\nwarm compress loosens the crust and has been shown\u00a0\u00a0 to help tremendously. People who have dandruff\u00a0\nare more likely to develop blepharitis. So Keeping\u00a0\u00a0 the dandruff under control can help reduce the\u00a0\nsymptoms, which can in theory help reduce rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 symptoms as well. #5 Makeup. Some makeup products\u00a0\nand techniques may help reduce the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0 skin redness. Try powder cosmetics with a green\u00a0\ntone and matte finish. I left one as well in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, that has seemed to help others.\u00a0\nSo check that out too. Does it have to be green?\u00a0\u00a0 Green is opposite of red on the color wheel, so\u00a0\nit's perfect for hiding any redness on your face.\u00a0 Now lets look at one of the most effective ways\u00a0\nto prevent it. Which is stress management. For\u00a0\u00a0 those who experience flare-ups as a result\u00a0\nof stress, stress management is an important\u00a0\u00a0 factor in managing your rosacea symptoms. hile\u00a0\nwe may not always know the cause of our stress,\u00a0\u00a0 we do know what relaxes us. Whether it\u00a0\nis reading a book at the end of the day,\u00a0\u00a0 going for a long walk at lunch hour, or\u00a0\neven calling a loved one just to say hello,\u00a0\u00a0 there are little things that we can choose to\u00a0\ndo each day that will help us better manage our\u00a0\u00a0 emotions and have a positive effect on our skin.\nI hope this video was useful to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 and that I hope you do share this video with\u00a0\nsomeone you know who can benefit from it. I also\u00a0\u00a0 hope that you gain just a little bit more control\u00a0\nover your rosacea flare ups. Like the video,\u00a0\u00a0 if you did enjoy it and subscribe to stay on\u00a0\nboard with all my other weekly health and wellness\u00a0\u00a0 videos.

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "published_at": "2021-06-23T13:00:10Z",
        "transcript": "so many of you have been requesting videos on rosacea especially since i talked about it being a skin condition that i personally struggle with so i thought a good place to start is to tell you a little bit about what rosacea is and some do's and don'ts to follow if you have rosacea i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and find skincare products that work for you first of all what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic but treatable skin condition that typically involves the face now i say treatable and not curable because sometimes patients will come see me in my office expect to get a treatment regimen for three to four months for their rosacea and then never deal with it again and the reality is that rosacea is a lifelong condition and there will be times when it's flaring and there will be times when it's under really good control but the goals of rosacea management aren't to get rid of it because there's no cure but to manage it in a way where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life and where you're happy with your skin it's a persistent inflammatory skin condition meaning that it often presents with redness and irritation and i'll talk a little bit more about the signs and symptoms of rosacea in a minute but it also affects men and women the women slightly more than men and it is really a disease of adults so the onset of rosacea is usually after the age of 30. more than 16 million americans have rosacea that's about 1 in 20 people and we think that globally about 5.5 percent of the world's population also has rosacea rosacea symptoms can include easily flushing or blushing persistent facial redness visible vessels on the skin surface easily irritated skin scaly skin dry skin itchy skin it also can affect the eyes so some people will get grittiness or irritation in their eyes and the last thing is that rosacea can have pimples and so it is often misdiagnosed as acne someone with rosacea might just have one or two of those symptoms and someone might have all of the things i just listed so it really can exist on a spectrum of severity but also the presentation can vary widely from person to person one question i get all the time is why do i have rosacea what is causing it is it something that i am doing and oftentimes it's not it we know that rosacea is caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors but a lot of times people don't have full control over those and so it's not about what's causing your rosacea at that point it's more about you have rosacea what are we going to do about it and it's great that we have awesome treatments to help get rosacea under control for people and manage those signs and symptoms so they're not suffering from their skin condition on a day-to-day basis prior to just a few years ago we used to categorize people with rosacea based on kind of the main signs or symptoms that they were presenting with i'm gonna go over those four categorizations even though we don't really use those clinically anymore because i do think it helps people understand the signs and symptoms that rosacea can present with but just know we don't use those categorizations anymore because we understand that people with rosacea can kind of have overlapping symptoms that span more than one category the first of sort of these four categories of rosacea is something called erythematolangictatic rosacea and really what this means is rosacea presenting with facial redness and typically this is redness in the center of the face so the chin the cheeks the nose and the forehead and this is redness that is often present at baseline but then gets worse with flushing or blushing based on exposure to certain triggers and then with that flushing or blushing you can also have altered sensations of the skin like sensitivity stinging burning or sort of this overwhelming heat sensation the other thing that can happen with this erythematologic rosacea is the presence of telangiectasias which are dilated blood vessels that are visible on the skin surface the second prior subtype of rosacea was something called papulopustular rosacea and really this was rosacea presenting with red bumps or red pustules which are red bumps filled with pus this is the type of rosacea or a feature of rosacea that is most commonly mistaken or mistreated as acne so it's something that's important for your doctor to be able to recognize the third prior categorization of rosacea was something called thymidus rosacea also called rhinophyma when it specifically involved the nose but really this is the development of sort of a thick bumpy texture to the skin and it's not a common feature of rosacea but it's certainly something to keep an eye out for the fourth category of rosacea was ocular rosacea or rosacea involving the eye this will often present as irritation light sensitivity watering eyes a gritty sensation in the eye but like i said before we are not using these four categorizations anymore we know that people can have redness and eye symptoms or feminist features and papules and pustules so it's more about what each unique person is presenting with when we're diagnosing and treating their rosacea so let's get into the do's and don'ts of rosacea i just want to put a caveat here though that these are guidelines they are not strict rules i know i'm a physician i'm a board certified dermatologist and i'm telling you these things about rosacea but just know that everyone's skin is different and if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is fine it's no big deal but these might be things that are worth thinking about if your rosacea is not under optimal control and you're trying to figure out ways for you to intervene and make a meaningful positive difference see a dermatologist we are able to accurately diagnose and give you a treatment plan for your rosacea i cannot tell you how many times i've seen rosacea misdiagnosed as acne lupus an allergic reaction eczema seborrheic dermatitis if your face is red or bumpy or sensitive and you don't know why get the help of an expert to make sure you're treating the right thing get to know your rosacea triggers and then avoid those triggers so although we don't know all of the causes of rosacea we do know certain environmental factors make rosacea worse and they can really vary from person to person so things like sun exposure hot or cold weather stress alcohol chocolate dairy spicy foods i mean the list goes on and it really is unique to each person what i recommend is that if you're not sure what your triggers are keep a rosacea diary any time your rosacea is flaring write down what you ate what you drink and what your surrounding environment is like being more aware of your triggers and avoiding them will absolutely help your rosacea stay under better control protect your skin from the sun so wide brim hats please and then sunscreen every single day now i used to tell my rosacea patients to use mineral-based sunscreens only so those with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as the uv filters because we thought they were maybe a little bit less irritating but what i found over time is that a lot of my rosacea patients can tolerate chemical uv filters in their sunscreen just fine so rather than limiting my patients sunscreen options i let them know that it might be a little bit of trial and error to find a sunscreen that they love but once they do use it every day keep your skin well moisturized people with rosacea often will have some skin barrier disruption and be more prone to barrier disruption even if they're using gentle skin care so using a nice moisturizer that feels good on your skin that doesn't cause stinging every single day and maybe sometimes twice a day if you're feeling particularly dry will help your skin feel better and look better too and my final do is have realistic expectations of what's achievable when treating rosacea typically the goals should be to have fewer flares and have your symptoms be well managed but if your goal is to have zero evidence that you've ever had rosacea you're really likely to be disappointed and i'm not saying that to be debbie downer dermatologist over here but if you focus on incremental improvement you're much more likely to find success in your treatment and be happier for it let's get into the don'ts i feel like i have to say this one more time before i get into the don'ts which is if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is totally fine that's okay keep doing it these are not rosacea laws these are just recommendations don't overheat your skin or expose it to extreme temperatures now this can be tricky to do all of the time but we do know that really cold weather and wind as well as really hot weather and indoor heating can all flare rosacea don't rub or scrub the face so any type of physical manipulation or physical exfoliation can cause increased redness and irritation so that goes for physical exfoliants like microbeads or scrubs as well as even like the rough fibers of a towel rubbed on the face they can all cause increased irritation so pat your face dry don't aggressively massage it just be nice to your skin don't use too many products a simple skincare regimen really is best especially if you're incorporating prescription topical medications to treat your rosacea you really don't want to be layering product after product after product you also might be sensitive to certain products so doing a little patch test in front of your ear or on your jawline for several days before kind of using it all over your entire face is not a bad idea don't use certain skin care ingredients that are known to trigger rosacea not every person with rosacea is going to be sensitive to the same types of skincare ingredients but in a survey conducted by the national rosacea society there were some ingredients that more people tended to be sensitive to and those are things like alcohol witch hazel fragrance menthol peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil there are other types of skin care ingredients like tretinoin and retinoids salicylic acid glycolic acid benzoyl peroxide antioxidants and topical vitamin c and people want to know i have rosacea those things can be irritating can i use them and really it's on a case-by-case basis one thing i recommend is never introducing more than one active to your regimen at once so if you're thinking okay i want to introduce a retinoid go low and slow and kind of see how it works out for you i use tretinoin in my routine even though i have rosacea but i could not do that initially i had to get my rosacea under really good control before i could incorporate that ingredient i never want to say anything is truly off limits for my rosacea patients but just know that you have to use things like acids or exfoliators with caution and understand that even if you can't tolerate them at this point in your rosacea journey you might be able to in the future don't be afraid to use prescription medication i find that sometimes in clinic i meet resistance from patients who just want to use over-the-counter options but this is a true skin disease and i don't find that most of my patients want over-the-counter options for their other types of diseases that they have skin disease should be no different don't be afraid of the prescriptions they are really developed for the treatment of rosacea they have been well studied give them a shot and my final don't is if you have rosacea and you have not been able to get it under control don't feel hopeless okay team up with a dermatologist maybe get a second opinion and also understand that rosacea is constantly being researched we are learning more about this condition day by day and as we move forward we are going to have even better treatments and interventions to offer what tips have helped you with your rosacea put them in the comments below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see

        "published_at": "2021-07-31T14:00:20Z",
        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "published_at": "2023-09-02T08:00:17Z",
        "transcript": "hi I'm Phoebe McDowell and welcome to another episode of dear dermatologist where we answer your most common skin care concerns I am joined here today by consultant dermatologist Angeli Mato and today we are tackling rosacea [Music] so back is 34 and works in finance has written in to say hi I have rosacea so I've always followed a gentle simple skincare routine given my skin is so sensitive can't even use retinol I don't want to cause any flare-ups is there a way I can safely include these types of products into my routine or do I need to accept that I just have to step away from them all together so rosacea is a really common inflammatory skin condition so it's characterized by a number of features so facial redness sensitivity spots which can look a little bit like acne you can sometimes get broken veins or thread veins often around the nose or on the cheeks and not everybody with rosacea will have every single one of these features and not everybody with rosacea will have it to the same extent or severity and surely not everyone with redness has rosacea precisely so there are lots of things that can mimic rosacea so getting an accurate diagnosis is actually incredibly important so there are other facial conditions that can cause redness okay so let's try and put a bit of a treatment plan together for Beck what would you recommend so I think the foundation of treating rosacea and managing it is a good skin care routine and these lifestyle factors and things that you're putting onto the skin are incredibly important you do need to cleanse the skin in the morning and going for a cleanser that ideally is simple it doesn't have a lot of essential oils or fragrances which might disrupt the barrier function of the skin if you want to try active ingredients like vitamin C vitamin C is generally tolerated quite well what you probably want to do is look for an ingredient called ascorbic acid but at a relatively low-ish concentration so maybe about five to ten percent so you can check that on the packaging of the product that you're buying that is a type of vitamin C it is so it's a formulation of vitamin C and a few drops of vitamin C on the surface of the skin may help to reduce inflammation that can be associated with it with rosacea in general though before you start a new product don't go diving in and dolloping a whole load on every day maybe experiments starting off once a week or twice a week and if your skin is able to handle that then slowly build up over time after that moisturizing so you've cleansed you've used your vitamin C serum if you can tolerate it I.E there is no burning no stinging no irritation then going for a gentle moisturizer ideally free of fragrance free of very drying alcohols in it and then after that wearing a sunscreen and this is so important throughout the year because we know that over 80 percent of people who suffer with rosacea their redness gets worse because of ultraviolet light so the sunscreen won't treat the rosacea but it will prevent the redness getting worse over time and then make up afterwards if you choose to do that so that's probably a good basic morning routine evening routine you want to make sure you've taken everything off our skin comes into contact with dirt sweat pollution Grime we're wearing sunscreen all of that has to come off the skin so again a gentle cleanser followed ideally by a good moisturizing product now retinol is a little bit more tricky retinols or vitamin A products can be incredibly irritating to the Skin So my general advice here is start off with a low percentage so a 0.1 or a 0.3 percent and also maybe just test patch a small area maybe on the neck or a tiny patch in front of the ear if you get no redness peeling flaking soreness irritation you're probably okay to stop building that into your routine but if you're super sensitive it might be that retinol is not for you so let's start with cleanser what brands you recommend okay so in terms of general terms I really do like the event tolerance range and I do like the La Roche Posay tellerian now with rosacea prone skin some people find their skin is super dry and if that's the case going for a Milky or a cream cleanser some people on the other hand find that they are rosacea prone but they're not massively sensitive and the skin can be a little bit oily and acne prone in that case going for a foaming cleanser might be slightly better as an option so I like these two if we're talking generally about vitamin C serums something like these skinceutical C for ruleic that's usually it's well tolerated and I'd say a few drops of this underneath moisturizer moisturizers wise I think the talarian sensitive rich and tellurian sensitive cream are very good they don't tend to contain too many ingredients that can aggravate or disrupt the Skin Barrier function itself and then I think other than that what you're looking at is making sure that you have got a good sunscreen that you like and the caution and the slow build up of a retinol particularly with that patch test maybe on the neck or in front of the ear area and seeing how you get on and SPF chemical physical does it matter if you've got very sensitive skin with your rosacea and that is a feature of your rosacea then going for a mineral or a physical sunscreen May suit you better and if you get a mineral or a physical sunscreen that's tinted it may also help neutralize some of the redness and cut that down if you haven't got massively sensitive skin then it's okay to use a chemical sunscreen but I think sensitivity is what would drive your sunscreen choice so back just to recap this is your rosacea skincare prescription so gentle cleanser in the morning followed by a vitamin C serum following that a gentle simple moisturizer which is ideally fragrance free and then a mineral sunscreen and in the evening we need to cleanse the skin again and then moisturize caution with retinol maybe patch test a small area see how you get on with that and then gradually build up its use we hope that answers your question back and that it's useful for everyone

        "transcript": "welcome back is it just redness or is it something more if you're experiencing rosacea or think you might be we've got a beginner's guide of tips and tricks to treat it with dermatologist Dr Gita [Applause] talking about what is rosacea yeah I mean I think rosacea is sort of best described as something that is like an inflammatory skin condition your Skin's inflamed it's red it can look like acne it's not it can have these bumps it can feel stingy and tender and it's something that people suffer with chronically we're going to bring in our model Michelle here to help explain so what is it sometimes confused with or yeah you know so it's thank you so much so having Michelle here is great because we can sort of have a look at her skin she's kindly agreed to do that so we've got uh this redness in the background affecting the cheeks the nose the chin the forehead and also some small bumps that can look like acne and so sometimes people think it's acne and that redness in the background that's diffuse sometimes people can mistake that for sensitive skin or irritation and they think oh well it's just the products I'm using it's not an underlying skin condition okay so Michelle for you how long have you had your rosacea for and how would you describe that it presents itself sure um you know it's been about 20 years it started in my 20s and I'm in my 40s now and it's just gotten worse over time really red just as Dr yadav describes it red bumps and can be really sensitive and painful okay we want to talk about uh doctor what cause is this it's a bit complicated but I think I can break it down by saying it's generally sort of the way your Skin's microbiome reacts to the world so we got all this stuff that lives on us it's part of that makes our skin healthy and good but sometimes that gets a little bit out of whack and it can cause inflammation and that's why it doesn't always look the same it can have triggers and flares and it depends on what you're doing to kind of make it look a bit worse or make it feel a bit better okay so you mentioned flare-ups we're going to play a little true or false okay I'll get the audience to play a little true or false with me and we're going to break down some of the things that might cause your rosacea to get worse so here's your first scenario every night Sophia comes home and has several glasses of wine to wind down I feel you Sophia her excessive alcohol has caused her to develop rosacea true or false what do you all think most of you are saying false oh there's some truths in there and I'm a true as well what is it Dr yadav it's false it's false it's false yes [Applause] but maybe a bit of a trick question because you see um alcohol doesn't cause rosacea and certainly there's a bit of stigmatization around gosh that person has that red colored face they're drinking too much it's not that it's that alcohol can flare rosacea and so you may have it in the background already those blood vessels they dilate you start looking a little bit more pink and all the good things in life become harder to look good doing Michelle do you get flare-ups if you've had wine absolutely red wine is the worst I miss it and do you like red wine I love it I'm so sorry thank you okay scenario number two Amanda's skin has changed it feels hot and tender with dry swollen patches that won't clear up with treatment however she can't have rosacea because she's a woman of color is that true or is that false I don't know I thought that was true I didn't know women of color got rosacea but you all are saying it's false I feel like I might be wrong here doctor what is it um sorry to say you are okay before you know you know very good I think one of sort of the key lessons that I like to explain to patients and to everyone here today is that uh skin of color redness doesn't show up so easily on it but it can be there and so it's easy to think that it wouldn't affect someone with brown or black skin but definitely possible okay good to know just maybe harder to see harder to see but it's there so let's talk about ways to treat rosacea Dr yadav walk us through maybe a gentle skin care routine and you know this is something maybe Michelle can adopt as well that's right and you said it gentle is the rule of thumb here so you know I've brought with me a couple of different examples of products starting with a gentle cleanser is the most important you can also use like a micellar water I've picked one that's got aloe in it because that can be soothing for irritated sensitive skin next you're going to want to make sure you use a corrective product something that has azelaic acid for those that are a bit price sensitive there's a great product by the ordinary a little bit more of a sophisticated product might be something by skin suit goals that has a redness neutralizer in it and that works very well as a cream these are both lightweight formulas and you need that for skin that's prone to breaking out with rosacea pimples not acne pimples because it can be occlusive otherwise and the last finishing move if it's in the morning and you have your regular facial routine using a sunscreen Pro tip one that has tinted in it so it's pigmented because that'll protect your skin against visible light in addition to ultraviolet light and that visible light we know in white skin makes it look more red and brown skin can make it look more Brown and pigmentation alteration so it's a great thing to use if you've got rosacea's a tinted sunscreen do you mind just taking that tinted and putting a little bit on mine so that's interesting because I've never heard before that you should stick with a tinted one just because it's also going to relieve some of the color just the discoloration and not make it go worse and that's where the evidence is going and I think it's really important and it feels good it looks good on all of our uh different skin tones it sure does Dr thank you so much let's go to break a great modeling [Applause]",

        "transcript": "hi I'm Phoebe McDowell and welcome to another episode of dear dermatologist where we answer your most common skin care concerns I am joined here today by consultant dermatologist Angeli Mato and today we are tackling rosacea [Music] so back is 34 and works in finance has written in to say hi I have rosacea so I've always followed a gentle simple skincare routine given my skin is so sensitive can't even use retinol I don't want to cause any flare-ups is there a way I can safely include these types of products into my routine or do I need to accept that I just have to step away from them all together so rosacea is a really common inflammatory skin condition so it's characterized by a number of features so facial redness sensitivity spots which can look a little bit like acne you can sometimes get broken veins or thread veins often around the nose or on the cheeks and not everybody with rosacea will have every single one of these features and not everybody with rosacea will have it to the same extent or severity and surely not everyone with redness has rosacea precisely so there are lots of things that can mimic rosacea so getting an accurate diagnosis is actually incredibly important so there are other facial conditions that can cause redness okay so let's try and put a bit of a treatment plan together for Beck what would you recommend so I think the foundation of treating rosacea and managing it is a good skin care routine and these lifestyle factors and things that you're putting onto the skin are incredibly important you do need to cleanse the skin in the morning and going for a cleanser that ideally is simple it doesn't have a lot of essential oils or fragrances which might disrupt the barrier function of the skin if you want to try active ingredients like vitamin C vitamin C is generally tolerated quite well what you probably want to do is look for an ingredient called ascorbic acid but at a relatively low-ish concentration so maybe about five to ten percent so you can check that on the packaging of the product that you're buying that is a type of vitamin C it is so it's a formulation of vitamin C and a few drops of vitamin C on the surface of the skin may help to reduce inflammation that can be associated with it with rosacea in general though before you start a new product don't go diving in and dolloping a whole load on every day maybe experiments starting off once a week or twice a week and if your skin is able to handle that then slowly build up over time after that moisturizing so you've cleansed you've used your vitamin C serum if you can tolerate it I.E there is no burning no stinging no irritation then going for a gentle moisturizer ideally free of fragrance free of very drying alcohols in it and then after that wearing a sunscreen and this is so important throughout the year because we know that over 80 percent of people who suffer with rosacea their redness gets worse because of ultraviolet light so the sunscreen won't treat the rosacea but it will prevent the redness getting worse over time and then make up afterwards if you choose to do that so that's probably a good basic morning routine evening routine you want to make sure you've taken everything off our skin comes into contact with dirt sweat pollution Grime we're wearing sunscreen all of that has to come off the skin so again a gentle cleanser followed ideally by a good moisturizing product now retinol is a little bit more tricky retinols or vitamin A products can be incredibly irritating to the Skin So my general advice here is start off with a low percentage so a 0.1 or a 0.3 percent and also maybe just test patch a small area maybe on the neck or a tiny patch in front of the ear if you get no redness peeling flaking soreness irritation you're probably okay to stop building that into your routine but if you're super sensitive it might be that retinol is not for you so let's start with cleanser what brands you recommend okay so in terms of general terms I really do like the event tolerance range and I do like the La Roche Posay tellerian now with rosacea prone skin some people find

you get on and SPF chemical physical does it matter if you've got very sensitive skin with your rosacea and that is a feature of your rosacea then going for a mineral or a physical sunscreen May suit

today\nI know y'all missed me well anyways guys on the last episode of do and don'ts we\ntalked about blackheads if you haven't seen that video yet go check it out\nright now or maybe after this video so today guys I'm gonna talk about\nsomething very special for those of you who are really really really frustrated\nbecause you have no idea why your cheeks are so red all the time I feel you guys\nokay I'm on the same page as y'all I know this can be very stressful that\nis why today our topic is about rosacea when blood vessels constantly expand and\ncontrast and they actually lose the string to contrast back that is when it\ncauses the face to flush there are three main reasons of rosacea number one is\nhormones the most common cause of redness the results from decrease of estrogen level number two is changes in temperature the\ntemperature differences between indoors outdoors UV rays or even long-term\nexposure to the cold weather are all changes in temperature that causes\nredness number three the skin barrier using the wrong skincare products can\ncause redness by damaging the skins barrier so now that we've learned about\nthe causes of rosacea stay tuned until the very end because we're gonna be\nactually talking about how you can prevent rosacea and tips on how to\nimprove it all right so for today's do and don'ts we\nhave prepared seven tips on how to prevent\nor to improve rosacea so let's get started\ndo number one: foods that help with facial flushing one of the ingredients\nthat is excellent is mulberry leaf now this is a cold natured ingredient and\nalso this is not just great for the red flushing of your face but also it's\ngreat for your migraines we want to recommend that you just drink mulberry\ntea it'll be really nice to drink dried mulberry tea or we want to recommend\nthat you mix with water and Mulberry powder together that's a great\ncombination too then the second food is beans beans beans beans I love beans\neverybody loves beans and for those of you who have went through rosacea due to\nhormones we want to highly recommend beans beans are rich in isoflavones and\nthey also function as female hormones DK over there say he doesn't like beans but\ni like beans and beans are very very good for you next food is a very\nfamiliar one it's oranges did you know that oranges contain vitamin P which\nfunctions to strengthen skins capillaries this helps them to be less\nsensitive to external irritants and this helps with rosacea number two cleanse\nwith cold water using cold water to wash your face or to splash it on your face\nalleviate actually facial flushing causing the blood vessels to contract\nalso did you know that putting ice on the roof of your mouth actually helps to\nlower the temperature of your mouth slightly lowering the blood temperature\nof the blood vessels that goes through your throats the brain detects the slight\nslight temperature change and contracts the blood vessels to alleviate redness\nespecially for special occasions where you really don't want your face to\nbecome red you want to prevent that it's great if you put an ice in your mouth or\nyou get a cold drink to prevent your face from flushing. do number three lower\nthe skin's temperature rosacea results as the face's\ntemperature increases so it's helpful to lower the body's temperature so if you\nkeep your feet or the lower part of your body cooled or in cold water this can\nactually help to prevent rosacea in addition to lower the temperature of\nyour face with skincare we want to recommend that you use products with\ncooling agents we want to recommend that you use products that has really\nexcellent ingredients or agents to lower the skin use a product that can actually\nlower the skin temperature by one degree and it will hydrate skin from deep within\ndo number four care for the skins with sheet masks now sheet masks\nactually care for the skin temperature as a whole thing it's an excellent\nexcellent thing prevent rosacea with sheet masks that not only hydrates\nand soothe the skin but make sure that you use a product that doesn't have\nharsh substances like alcohol artificial coloring and phenoxyethanol we recommend\na super super gentle type of sheet mask the gauze type of sheet mask to prevent\nrosacea and another thing is we want to recommend that you use products with\nceramides in it to strengthen the skins barrier or we want to recommend a sheet\nmasks that lowers the temperature of the skin so that I can prevent rosacea and\nnot only that it suits heat and it has gentle agents in do number five\nstrengthen the skins barrier using the wrong cosmetics actually damages our\nskins barrier making our skin more vulnerable to external irritants because\nof this we need to strengthen our skins barrier with the proper and right\nproducts prevent redness and strengthen the skins barrier by using products with\ningredients such as stearic acid caprylic and Capric triglyceride\nwhich was a very mouthful but work really well to strengthen the skins\nbarrier Do number six apply UV Protection UV rays expands the capillaries now this\nis why it's so important for you to avoid the sunlight and for you to put on\nsunscreen even though when you are indoors use a product that has both UVA\nrays UVB rays and that can protect the heat all at the same time this will help\nto lower the skin's temperature by preventing rosacea for you guys Do number 7: makeup that covers redness When covering redness it's important that you\nuse a yellow tone base to cover your skin now this is much better than using\na really thick or concealer that doesn't fit your skin tone with the full full\ncoverage so cover your redness this with a very natural BB cream that can cover\nyour redness and both your pores as well use a BB cream that is layerablel that\nis buildable because you need to stack it up a little bit to cover the rosacea\nand we want to recommend that you use BB cream with a very natural finish because\nyou don't want to use those BB creams often that has great kind of tone to it until now we have learned about the do's for rosacea now let's go on to the\ndon'ts for rosacea Don't number one processed or overly stimulated foods in\nparticular, fillers in processed foods actually causes rosacea so you should\navoid foods that can raise the body's temperature I know how hard it can be\nbecause I love love spicy food too but really really spicy food or salted food\ncan have an effect on rosacea instead nourish the skin with fresh produce and\nalso protein and carbohydrates and an adequate amount of fats Don't number two: harsh exfoliation those that tends to have rosacea also has\nsensitive skin isn't that true it goes hand-in-hand right so using a harsh wash\ntowel or using a scrub can actually damage our skins barrier and it can\nworsen our rosacea avoid harsh excessive foliation and we need to put our focus\non exfoliating while hydrating the skin at the same time use essence type of\nproducts that contains AHA to gently melt away dead skin cells while at the\nsame time that has really hydrating agents as well to moisturize the skin\nand to exfoliate the skin at the same time don't number three cleansers that\nleave the face dry cleansers that give you a very squeaky-clean\nkind of finish also washes away our natural oils this leads to harsh\nirritation and dryness making the symptoms of rosacea even worse those\nwith rosacea should use about two to three pumps of a low pH cleanser these\ncleansers actually leave a less of a dry feeling so let's care for our rosacea\nwith hydrating cleansers Don't No.4:  ingredients that trigger rosacea\nwhile you should definitely avoid harsh products like alcohol you should also be\nvery careful of ingredients such as peppermint eucalyptus and clove oil which\ncan induce rosacea so those with rosacea should use\nproducts with really mild ingredients that can calm your skin like Guaiazulene at\nthe last step of your skin care apply a generous amount of Guaiazulene cream on to\nthe spots or the areas that you have rosacea it will alleviate rosacea caused\nby heat and irritation not only that it will calm and regenerate the skin this\nproducts nickname is actually called the blue cream for the red skin so just by\nthat nickname you can get an idea of how effective this cream is to calm your\nrosacea more exciting news oh my goodness news for y'all I know that we were very\nannoyed because we love the blue cream and there was a tiny tiny little bottle\nof 30 milliliters but Klairs has answered our prayers because a new\nproduct is coming out it's the same thing but in 60 milliliters so it's a\nhuge tube for us to use and I thank Klairs for answering\nour prayers and making it bigger don't number five hot showers hot springs and\nsaunas a lot of us probably really love long hot showers and also going to the\nhot springs and going to sauna it's one of my favorite things to do with my mom\nhowever this of course can help with blood circulation but it is really\nreally bad for rosacea this constant exposure of heat actually expands our\ncapillaries so this can actually worsen the symptoms of rosacea don't number six\nblood pressure medicines blood pressure medicines actually expands the blood\nvessels so it has the ability to induce rosacea\naside from blood pressure medicine and angina medicine common painkillers or\nthe medicine for our stomach can cause rosacea so we want to make sure that you\ndouble check your medicine cabinet to be safe but to be more safe we really need\nyou to double check with your doctors because you might need these medicines\nokay all right guys don't number seven Don't drink alcohol. as alcohol is broken down in our liver\nit not only expands our blood vessels but acetaldehyde produced within the\nbody as metabolism occurs induces rosacea as well so because of this\nreason I know it's hard but for those of you who is struggling with rosacea needs\nto stay away from alcohol alright guys so that is it for today for those of you\nwho are really stressed due to rosacea we really hope from the bottom of our\nheart that this video could have helped and for the next video we're gonna\nactually have four reviewers episode it's gonna be super fun we're gonna have\na lot of hairy friends who try out hair removal products so it's gonna be super\nfun so you guys have to watch it okay alright guys thank you so much for\ntuning in until the very end and please subscribe and like this video and I'll\nsee you guys next time remember guys we're beautiful just as we are",

I don't really like salmon, but I'll trade it for some halibut. And then, Brussels sprouts are really, really good. Sincerely, can we use any seafood? Because I don't love cooked salmon. I like salmon... And so, Omega-3s in salmon or other cooked seafood, yeah. So, I can eat other fish and get my Omega-3s. Exactly. It's not the only fish. Absolutely not. And any cruciferous vegetable or just Brussels sprouts, specifically? Any cruciferous vegetable is fine. They're all good for your skin? They're all good for your skin, yeah.

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and

        "published_at": "2023-05-23T20:46:57Z",
        "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so I have decided to officially dedicate a part of my channel to rosacea since now miss rosacea has officially become a major part of my life involuntarily um which I'm not happy about what what can you do um so I thought that I would just come on here and share with you guys stuff I've been doing to kind of alleviate or help with my rose shot that attacks here and there more frequently than I would like but as you guys know I have been getting laser treatments uh BBL and stuff like that to get not get rid of it because you can't really get rid of it it's something that doesn't actually have a cure but to help calm it down however that does not help the texture that comes with uh rosacea unfortunately so those lasers are only good for getting rid of the redness but that's about it so with rosacea comes these small bumps that look like acne and lots of texture which is really tough to deal with because when you put makeup on to I don't know diffuse it it actually makes it worse because you're putting makeup on bumps that are going to actually rise up more and they're actually going to be more noticeable which really sucks so the only way to deal with it is to actually try to get rid of it recently I had a flare out so bad unlike actually I've had this kind of flare out one other time but this one was really really really bad to the point that I actually ended up locking myself in my apartment I did not go anywhere I canceled every plan I didn't even even when I wanted to go get groceries covet's been over for a really long time and I had to look for a mask so that I'd pretend like I'm still worried about covet put on my sunglasses I look like a crazy person I was even considering putting fake bangs just so nobody recognizes me but I really really had a tough time with it um it really affects your self-confidence and um yeah it's really really difficult if you have anything skin related you you only then realize how important and what a significant role beautiful skin actually has on your daily life the point that now I think oh if I have clear skin all I need is just moisturizer and I feel so confident going out which before when I didn't have rosacea I would feel like I have to pack on all this makeup so that my skin looks even better but now I have a different level of appreciation for um the smooth skin that I do have so after that flare out that happened where I ended up locking myself into the house the only other place other than the grocery store that I went to was um to the walk-in clinic because I was like I cannot I cannot deal with this I had a major major meltdown um but I went to the walk-in clinic and the doctor prescribed me this gold tube it's called Roosevelt I think that's how you say it I'm sorry if I'm butchering the name but this is what it looks like and let me tell you this has been my Saving Grace um I've been applying it you're supposed to apply it once a day um I think until the two finishes um and you might have to just keep rebuying it however um you apply it once you don't want to overdo it because you actually might have a different kind of flare out that happens because this is a strong cream so you really need to actually make sure that you're not applying it more than the um directions actually say but within even one day I felt like it really um calmed my skin but still obviously I had all these acne acne you know spots and they were all over my forehead all over my temples and then all over my cheeks if I one day have the guts to um show you guys the pictures which I'm gonna hope that by the time I'm uploading this video I have the guts to put a picture somewhere over here but you would be shocked at what a difference it made and obviously today there's no filters on this camera um I wanted to show you guys the purest form of my skin the only thing I do have on my skin is a tinted moisturizer or tinted SPF but that's about it as you guys can see the texture is pretty much gone all the acne is pretty much gone and this is my skin pretty much almost raw almost raw um I promise you you're not going to be disappointed um it is something that you have to get prescribed it's not an over counter cream and the only other downside with it there's first of all no side effects the gentleman said that the gentleman the doctor said there's no side effects it's not going to harm your skin in any shape or form if anything it's going to actually better um the quality of your skin the only downside is a price I believe I paid 265 for it if I'm not mistaking um so yeah I mean for a small tube like this it is pretty pricey but there is no price on beautiful skin and the confidence that you regain after fixing your skin is honestly like this this is worth a million bucks to me so um yeah I just wanted to quickly share that with you guys I will definitely be sharing a lot more um information about my rosacea Journey because it's a never-ending one there's no cure for it and I feel for anybody that is going through it because it is really really really really frustrating because it's not just um to do with creams it's what you ingest activities that you do that bring the flare outs out so I'll be I'll be sharing all the information that I gather throughout my journey but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed watching this informative video um if you guys did please hit that like button and subscribe to my channel until next time",

        "transcript": "are you struggling with facial redness postural spots or just irritated skin keep watching to learn a holistic approach to rosacea on its treatment in today's video if you're new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret

        "transcript": "hello my friends today we are talking about rosacea again and before we start I wanted to thank you for your wonderful reactions and comments to my rosacea recovery Story video and to my rosacea skin care products video and you inspired me to create a video about rosacea makeup products the makeup products that I used when I had my rosacea really in a bad place and these makeup products really make my skin feel good and they didn't cause any new brain breakout so let's start if you're new on this channel my name is Anna and I share very easy to follow Beauty routines tips on how to grow longer and healthier hair and I shared my story of rosacea I had rosacea for 10 years and after 10 years I have successfully recovered from rosacea I have this video on my channel and I will leave the link to it down below in the description and I will also link some other related videos in the description down below as well let's start talking about makeup products and I completely understand you if you feel insecure going out wearing just sunscreen without any makeup if your rotation is really visible on your face that that was how I felt for for those 10 years of my life that's why your direction should be tinted mineral sunscreens first of all you need to go only for mineral sunscreens when you have rosacea you need to forget about those chemical sunscreens by the way I will uh add on the screen the list of ingredients that you generally need to avoid in your skincare and beauty makeup products when you have rosacea so going back to Mineral sunscreens you have so many good tinted mineral sunscreens on the market right now I created a separate video listing my favorite tinted mineral sunscreens they have all really nice coverage and they can help you cover your rosacea here in my hands I have my very favorite tinted mineral sunscreen it is almost over so I had to cut the upper part of it in order to get the remainings out of the tube I will put on the screen the way the full product normally looks I've already ordered myself a new one it's supposed to arrive tomorrow this is an svr tinted mineral sunscreen svr is a French brand it is wonderful brand this is SPF 50 and you can have this sunscreen for normal skin and for dry skin the one that I always go for is the one for dry skin with rosacea I always feel that my skin is more on the drier side than on the normal oily side this product just works wonderfully on those rosacea breakouts on those pimples it never makes them bigger it makes them look smaller it just covers everything at the same time protecting your skin from the Sun honestly it's just my favorite Foundation I just love this product so so much and I always feel safe with it I know that it's not going to cause a you pimple to come like when I'm using some other foundations from other brands I sometimes feel a little bit scared maybe this product might cause me a new pimple but this one never ever ever another product that I can recommend to cover your skin when you have rosacea is Chanel CC cream this is a sunscreen as well it is mineral sunscreen as well it has SPF 50 it has wonderful coverage it is going to cover all your breakouts your rosace is going to be completely invisible with this cream it is also very very glowy so I don't always wear it because I don't always want to look glowy most of the days I would prefer to use the svr one and this one is also more expensive so this is more like on fancy days fancy occasions I would prefer to use this one and when I add a new rosacea pimple like a new breakout I would usually not go for the Chanel because it's more like glowy and oily and I wouldn't want to get that effect on the pimple I would prefer to go for svr it would be more like mat and dry but svr is not really a mat uh finish just comparing to CC cream of Chanel it's more matte then I wanted to show you a concealer which is green when people talk about makeup products for rosacea skin they always mention green concealers and green primers by the way I don't use any primers with rosacea I would sometimes use an ninite serum or AEL acid serum but usually when my rosacea was really bad I would prefer to start doing my makeup on a bare face talking about Green uh concealers I have never been a huge fan of green concealers because with rosacea my worst concern was those stubborn pimples that would just not go away that would stay like those bumps that that you can't get rid of and the green concealer is not really going to help you hide those bumps the green concealer is best for people who just have redness like redness on the cheek or redness on the nose but no pimples and breakouts like that for me it was quite useless but sometimes I love using it in the area around my nose and I still use it because it's really common for a lot of people not not only even people who have rosacea to get the skin a little bit like darker and redder around your nose like in this area and I love using a green concealer out there there and I would usually use the green concealer before using a CC cream or a tinted uh mineral sunscreen by svr or any other Foundation because it just works better you don't apply green concealer above like after Foundation you apply it before and then it will like kind of blend with all of your other makeup and make that area of your face appear less red the one that I have is by xivi this is pretty Libra skin caring corrector in a green shade it is very light it is not full coverage it's not going to help you cover a pimple but it's going to help you cover the red areas of your face moving on to concealers that can actually help you cover a pimple a breakout my very favorite one uh for Rosa skin for Anytime really my favorite concealer in the world is Nars creamy radiant concealer this is a shade van this concealer is just perfect it looks wonderful underneath my eyes it looks really nice covering anything that I want to cover it has a really nice ingredients list that I like it never caused me to break out if you're looking for a concealer to add to your makeup Beauty bag you need this one in your life I promise you you're not going to regret it and in the end to set my makeup I would use a powder before I talk about the powder I just want to to mention the blush I really don't think the blush can actually cause you to break out more because I would usually apply a blush in the areas where I don't have my rosacea like in here I don't have I never had rosacea and out there but when I had rosacea I was still kind of anxious about trying new products because I was afraid that they are going to make me uh break out and get my rosacea worse and especially with creamy products I was very hant and if you are hant if you want to try a rare Beauty creamy creamy blush the one that is so famous and popular right now you can with my rosacea I used rare Beauty uh liquid blush it worked fine I loved it it made me feel beautiful and wonderful I even created a separate video about this blush so if you want to get yourself a rare Beauty liquid blush with rosace apply it after using your uh CC cream or uh mineral tinted mineral sunscreen you can use it you can blend it don't forget to wash your makeup brushes frequently by the way with rosacea it's very important to have everything everything always clean by the way mine is almost empty already so stting your makeup with um with powder my favorite powder for setting makeup with rosacea is Laura Mercier trans translucent loose setting powder this this powder is translucent it doesn't look white on your face it looks like your skin color it really like Blends in with your makeup and you don't really see the color of the powder I feel like it's not clogging the pores it's not making me break out it makes my skin feel wonderful and uh it is quite mattifying but it's not too matifying if you don't apply too much I apply this powder with uh the brush with a setting brush but you can also apply it with a beauty blender if you want more coverage I also uh used to uh use the powder from Sephora Sephora has a mineral powder which was good for my Rosa skin as well but I would prefer translucent powder by Laura Mercier it just it just feels lighter on the skin and you don't really need any more coverage after using um a CC cream or a sunscreen you just need to set your makeup and for these purposes I think the setting powder is the best and I feel like Laura Mercier is my favorite for rosacea skin in my experience I always felt good about this powder I always felt good about all of these prod products and I honestly understand how really complicated it might be to choose products when you have rosacea skin it might really like make you feel anxious because you're afraid that uh something that you buy and apply to your skin might make your skin feel worse and might cause a new breakout so trust me you're going to be fine with this product I really sincerely wish you to get better with your rosacea for your rosacea to be cured if you have any questions about rosacea about skincare or makeup products with rosacea please write them in the comments below I will be very very happy to answer you I'm not a doctor but I'm somebody who had Rosa for years and years and I can understand how it feels and I can remember all of the moments that when I did something wrong I felt so guilty that I I'm not like good enough I can understand you I'm going to help you as much as I can please push the like button

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see
