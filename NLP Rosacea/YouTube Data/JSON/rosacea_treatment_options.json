        "transcript": "hi everyone welcome back to another lesson this lesson is on rosacea so we're going to talk about some of the potential causes of this condition we're also going to talk about some of the triggers the signs and symptoms so we're going to get into some of the specific skin lesions that can occur with rosace then we're going to talk about how it's diagnosed and how it's treated so rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition involving recurrent episodes of skin lesions on the face we're going to get into more detail as to these exact skin lesions later on in this lesson rosacea is an autoimmune condition which means that it is the patient's own immune system that attacks its own cells and tissues to cause a lot of these signs and symptoms now although this is known to be an autoimmune condition the pathophysiology is not entirely understood but we're going to talk about some of the known pathophysiology later on in this lesson and rosace may be associated with other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease like ulcer of cius and Crohn's disease and cardiovascular diseases and neurologic diseases and rosacea is estimated to affect at least 5% of the general population which means that it is is a relatively common condition and it is more likely to affect certain ethnic groups particularly those with Celtic Heritage those individuals with Celtic Heritage have a higher likelihood of having rosacea compared to other populations and this condition affects individuals between the ages of 30 to 50 most often now let's talk about some of the potential causes of rosace so although the causes are not entirely known it's believed that genetics are involved we talked about some of those ethnic groups that are at higher likelihood of having rosace so genetics are likely involved in rosace now some other potential causes of rosace include Demodex mites Demodex mites are these microscopic hair follicle mites and it's been shown that when looking at lesions of patients who have rosacea their lesions contain high levels of these Demodex mites so there does seem to be an association between high levels of these Demodex mites or these hair follicle mites and rosacea and there has been another potential cause that has been noted and this is an infection with helicobactor poori or hpylori this is a gram negative bacteria that can cause an infection in the stomach so there does seem to be an association between an infection with H pylori and the onset of rosacea as well there has also been some association with exposure to ultraviolet or UV rays this may be more of a trigger and we're going to talk about triggers of skin lesions later on in this lesson so this may be more of a trigger of Ros not the exact cause and then certain medic have also been noted to either cause rosacea or trigger an underlying rosace some of these medications include steroids and some blood pressure medications now let's talk about some of the pathophysiology behind why rosacea occurs so it all has to do with disregulation of the innate and adaptive immune functioning and vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels so vasod dilation would be dilation of blood vessels so these are the two main categories of mechanisms and the reason why these may occur why disregulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning may occur includes increased expression or overexpression of tole like receptor 2 which is a cell receptor involved in annate and adaptive immune functioning so overexpression and overactivation of this receptor seems to be part of the pathophysiology in rosacea and with regards to the vasod dilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels there seems to be an increased release of vasoactive peptides so increased release of vasoactive peptides has been noted in patients with rosacea and patients with rosacea also seem to have higher levels of other particular receptors including increased or overexpression of transient receptor potential vanilloid one or trpv1 receptor and increased expression of trpa1 or transient receptor potential anchor in one receptor and there's some other receptors as well and each of these receptors seems to Al Al be associated with some of the triggers we're going to talk about later on in this lesson so some of these are involved in heat and cold Sensation that can cause changes to vasil regulation so we're going to talk a bit more about this later on in this lesson as well so some of these receptors can be involved in why certain things trigger the onset of skin lesions in rosacea but there also seems to be some interplay with having Demodex mites or infestation of Demodex mites and an infection with H pylori which seem to also increase some of the activation of some of these receptors and release of vasoactive peptides in some patients so again not all of the pathophysiology is known but these are some of the known factors in rosacea now there are several subtypes of rosacea that cause different clinical presentations one subtype is known as aromatic this subtype is more commonly going to be the initial presentation of rosacea another one is papulo postular this one can appear like acne and often times will occur later on in life so it can often times be termed as adult acne there is also a subtype known as fattis subtype and there's also one that is known as ocular subtype which affects the eyes and we're going to talk about all the clinical signs and symptoms of each of these subtypes later on in this lesson now it's important to make note of the fact that individuals can have features of different subtypes they can have some features of multiple subtypes and the subtypes may change over time they may be more likely to have aromatic subtype and then they may be more likely to have fattis subtype later on in their life now before we talk about the skin lesions let's talk about where they affect the face often times it's going to affect the forehead the nose and upper cheeks and the chin these are going to be common areas where we see a lot of the lesions we're going to talk about in this lesson and often times are going to be symmetric so if you see it on one side if you see it on the patient's right side you're also going to see it on the patient's left side so they're often times going to be symmetric and in these locations now let's actually talk about the clinical features of rosacea so with regards to the athato telen acatic subtype we see tasas tasas are these small dilated blood vessels that are often termed as spider veins so we can see these on the face in those areas we talked about before this is often times going to be more noted in older age we can also see Etha which is a reing of the skin this can be transient or non-transient so transient being that it can come and go away so it's temporary or it can be non-transient meaning that it can be permanent So the patient's face can become very rened and often times this is going to affect younger age groups this again is going to be part of the arithat telic tatic subtype and we can also see flushing in some patients so flushing is going to again be a transient reing of the face and it's often times going to occur in younger age groups now with regards to the papulopustular subtype of rosacea that we talked about before this is going to lead to papules so papules are these inflammatory raised skin lesions and we can also see pules so pules are also inflammatory but they are pus filled so they can often times be mistaken for acne and often times be termed as adult acne or acne rosacea but is not actually the same condition as acne because there are no comedones if you want more information on acne please check out my full lesson on that topic but suffice to say with the skin lesions in rosacea the way to distinguish these papules and postul from actually having acne vulgaris there are no comedones and often times a patient's going to have an episode of these clinical features and then they're going to go into remission and then they're going to go into another episode so there's often times going to be periods where they have an episode of skin lesions that go into remission and then something triggers them to also have another episode so there's often times going to be a pattern of episode and remission of these skin lesions some other clinical features that can be noted with these skin lesions include burning sensation from the lesions a tingling sensation from the lesions a stinging sensation can also be noted and then puitis which is an itching sensation so often times these are going to be some of the other clinical features that can be noted from these skin lesions as well let's talk about the ocular form of this condition so the ocular form of rosacea actually affects a majority of patients that actually get rosacea so 50 to 75% of patients will have eye involvement and often times what's going to be noted with ocular rosacea is that patients have issues with dryness of their eyes redness of their eyes or tearing they can often have blurred vision or light sensitivity and some more specific findings can be blefaritis which is an inflammation of the eyelids conjunctivitis which is an inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eyes keratitis which is an inflammation of the corne of the eye and iritis which is an inflammation of the iris of the eye so all of these can be noted in patients with rosacea as well and again it can affect 50 to 75% of patients who have rosacea and some patients can have another Finding known as a rinofima rinofima is an enlargement of the nose so this enlargement of the nose is due to hyperplasia of sebaceous glands so these sebaceous glands become enlarged and lead to an enlargement of the nose and this can often be due to chronic long-standing untreated rosacea so if there is long-standing untreated rosacea it can lead to this rinofima and what is noted with rhop is that almost all cases of rinofima occur in males it is very rare in female patients so again this is another clinical presentation of rosacea that can be found and rinofima would be under the classification of the fattis subtype of rosacea now let's talk about some of the triggering or exacerbating factors we talked about some of the potential triggers that can cause or increase the likelihood of having skin lesions from rosacea some of these include stress so stress can trigger rosacea skin lesions consumption of caffeine can also trigger the onset of skin lesions alcohol can also trigger skin lesions as well and consumption of hot liquids can trigger or worsen skin lesions in rosacea some other exacer factors include eating certain spices so certain very spicy foods can actually trigger the onset of skin lesions in rosacea we talked about some of those receptors when we talked about the pathophysiology of rosacea and a lot of them can be triggered by certain spices so capsacin in some very spicy foods can actually trigger and activate some of those receptors significant temperature changes so going from very hot to very cold that can also trigger skin lesions as well sunlight exposure we talked about UV light potentially being a cause but it's more likely to be an exacerbating factor and then wind exposure so wind hitting the face especially with significant changes in temperature this can also exacerbate or trigger skin lesions in rosacea as well so how do clinicians diagnose and treat rosacea the diagnosis of rosacea is often times going to be a clinical diagnosis so looking at the history and physical examination and getting some of those triggers we talked about before this is going to be enough to make the diagnosis for clinicians now with regards to how clinicians treat rosacea oftentimes they're going to break it down into categories of treatments so there's going to be lifestyle treatments so it's important to avoid exacerbating and triggering factors we talked about those in the last slide and gentle cleansing with moisturizers can also be helpful for some of those skin lesions and then sun protection so photo protection using sunscreen with at least an SPF of 30 can be helpful and the rest of the treatments are going to be more tailored to the specific spefic type of rosacea so with regards to ocular rosacea artificial tears can be helpful and metronidazol eye drops can also be helpful with regards to Emma so that reing of the skin of the face rodine tartrate gel can be helpful and oxymetazoline hydrochloride gel can also be helpful with regards to inflammatory lesions on the face these include tetracyclin and aiyin and topical metronidazol topical zic acid and icin cream to treat those Dem mites can also be helpful as well and with regards to issues with flushing in rosacea some clinicians may use propanolol or corvalol and laser therapy laser therapy can be helpful for the flushing in rosace in clinici can often treat the fima or the rinofima with doxycyclin isotretinoin and tetracyclin when it is in the inflammatory stage of the Rhino but when it's in the non-inflammatory stage when it has become enlarged in permanent surgical resection may be required and laser surgery can also be helpful in reducing the Rhino fima so if you want to learn more about other Dermatology

        "transcript": "There's nothing like an air of confidence. Looking good and feeling good inside. But what if you had a skin condition on your\nface? Would that impact your self-confidence? We're about to discuss the common chronic\ninflammatory skin condition called Rosacea with our guest, Board Certified Dermatologist,\nDr. Dimitry Palceski. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you for having me. Thanks for being here. Let's talk about Rosacea. What exactly is it doctor? Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder\nthat can give you redness to your face and can make you flush and give you pimples and\ngive you bumps. And it's interesting because 1 in 20 Americans\nhave it, which is about 16 million people. That's a lot. It is, but yet it's so under diagnosed, and\npeople that have Rosacea the problem with it is is that their perception of themselves\nand the people that look at them often give them a negative impact. And let's talk about that perception because\nhere the recent Face Values Global Perceptions Survey sponsored by Galderma Laboraties shows\nthat many ways in which Rosacea takes a deep emotional toll on sufferers. That's amazing. I mean, it really does impact them. Tremendously. More than we ever thought. And actually, what they did was, is they looked\nat 7,000 people across eight different countries. So, in all of these different countries, they\nfound that there was a common thread. People with redness were judged differently. They found that they were looked at to be\nless attractive. They were found to have less of an ability\nto have a date or to go out with somebody or to get a promotion at a job. And because of that it really affected the\nself-esteem of the person that had Rosacea, and also their social interactions with everybody\naround them. And we did a quick poll about that same thing\nwe're talking about, and I'd like our viewers to take a look. Shall we? Let's do that. What are your first impressions of these people\nin these pictures? Bad skin. I would say the lady needs a makeover. They look clean cut except for the face. Umm. Maybe sunburn? They don't look too happy? Need to change their skin. If it's an allergic reaction, get some kind\nof cream to clear it up. If I was the woman and I had to go out, then\nI'd put on makeup. Would you hire this person and do they look\nsuccessful to you? I wouldn't say I wouldn't hire them, but I'd\nsay they aren't terribly concerned with appearance, and it would depend on the office culture. I mean, there's no doubt that it can really\naffect someone's self-esteem. So, my question to you is if someone has Rosacea,\nDoctor, what can they do? I mean, it seems like we need more awareness\nand compassion for that matter. Oh, absolutely. Only 1 in 10 people, or 10%, of people that\nhave Rosacea even know that they have it or were diagnosed by a Dermatologist. Really? You have to go seek treatment or find, there\nhas to be support groups and more education so that people can treat their disease so\nthat it doesn't get worse. So why are they misdiagnosed? What's going on here? Why don't they know? Well, Rosacea is challenging because it can\nlook like other diseases of the skin. It could look like acne. And actually half of the people that have\nRosacea think they have acne. So when they start treating their perceived\nacne, and they make the Rosacea worse, they don't understand why. Oh my goodness. And then there's trigger factors. So there are certain things that make Rosacea\nflair, and it's all the good things. It's the spicy foods that you want to eat. It's the red wines. If you're emotionally upset, it makes you\nflair or flush. If you wear certain makeups. It all makes it worse. There's also some research that suggests that\nthere's a mite that lives on all of our skin called Demodex, and that mite has been shown\nto be found in greater quantities in people with Rosacea, which can potentially trigger\nit even more. So we know it's a chronic disease. Can you medicate it? Can you do something? Are there treatments? Oh my gosh. Absolutely. Once you find an accurate diagnosis, it can\nbe treated. Great. With what? Well. There are a few different options out there,\nand unlike over-the-counter medicines, these are actually FDA approved to calm down all\nof the symptoms of the redness. Soolantra Cream. Topical medicine you apply once daily, and\nwithin two weeks you'll start to see reduction within those bumps. There's an oral medicine called Oracea capsule. And Oracea is fantastic because it works from\nthe inside out. It's an anti-inflammatory that calms down\nthe surface changes. And then for persistent redness, Mirvaso Gel. You put it on and it can last up to 12 hours. And Doctor, what else should people know about\nthese medications. Like all medicines, side effects are possible. For Soolantra Cream, you can have some application\nsite irritations, some stinging, some burning. With Mirvaso Gel, they can be very similar\nas well. There can be some stinging, some redness,\nsome tinging. You can get a little bit of irritation. And for the oral medicine, you can sometimes\nsee a little bit of diarrhea. You can see some soreness to the throat or\nthe nose. Possibly some increase in liver enzymes, and\nevery now and then maybe a little high blood pressure. But again, I want to go back to the fact that\nif you suspect you have Rosacea or you don't know, it's really important to get that accurate\ndiagnosis from a Board Certified Dermatologist. Correct Doctor? Yes, correct. Because Rosacea gets worse over time. And if you can treat it early, you can control\nthe symptoms, you can watch the trigger factors and learn what they are, you can minimize\nall of the redness and the bumps and the pimples. Fabulous. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Thank you for what you do. And to find out more about Rosacea and treatment\noptions, you can go to Soolantra.com or our website, TheBalancingAct.com. (MUSIC).",

        "transcript": "So firstly, I think we have to encourage individuals to avoid the factors that go into flush, particularly sun exposure. I think sunshine needs to be explained as a factor that may aggravate rosacea over the years. Reducing inflammation by topical anti-inflammatory antibiotics, such as Metronidazole; we use azelaic acid for its anti-inflammatory effects. Topical Dapsone has been used more recently, and then the anti-inflammatory antibiotics such as the tetracycline. A new development recently is a low dose antibiotic, doxycycline, which acts as an anti-inflammatory, but maybe, it does not have this anti-bacterial effect, so this tries to bypass this resistance problem. The vascular rosacea -- lasers and intense pulsed light -- is one way of closing down these blood vessels, to reduce the flushing, and to reduce the background redness.",

Claire Alec and coffee yeah let's look at some pictures some so there was a treatment for this right right hockey whether you do a topical therapy there's a medication like antibiotics for example you can use to treat rosacea but if you have the redness and a flushing the only way to get rid of it permanently or for long term is to use lasers and that's what I'm doing in the video there usually with one laser treatment I like to use the best lasers what's called the V beam perfecta and with that laser with one treatment I can get somewhere between 50 to 70 percent improvement does it hurt it has it feels like a rubber band snapping on the skin right off you can handle it they don't work itself so do what you can put some numbing stuff on there though yeah sure we always economic can we try to be nice you don't have this like Sixth Sense of like hurting people what exactly is rosacea I don't I don't really get it is it is it a rash or is it a colorant is a rash but it's a chronic kind of inflammatory skin disease oh it's usually after the age of 30 SEC's women more than men but men when they get it can have worse cases so what it manifest is redness broken capillaries and get a lot of acne bumps oh and then oftentimes patients feel like they're red or flushing yeah particularly when they exercise when they drink alcohol is AC foods yeah what are the other options are there some topic you said there were some Tatars in topicals which can help with the acne portion of it but they don't really help with the redness and they really don't help with they don't help at all with a broken capillary sir I used to athletes that leaves or to reduce cuss so the patients who come into your office what is the complaint so so what they have they have broken capillaries and some flushy in the Facebook ok look really they say that like people notice it what they can say that it's embarrassing because their face gets to Fairview in one glass of wine you really flushed and it looks really patchy and modeled and also burns and stings a lot of patients and some patients are not actually you get some swelling in the face so it burnt is it just on the face or is it anywhere else in the body it's most likely in the face but you can actually get on the neck and chest as well it could it just be nerves I mean or because it's like alcohol or just stress or what called our alcohol does have histamine and it's just sometimes tell the certain patient on alcohol could get like this alcohol rash temporarily just for an hour - yeah so it's it's just this is an inflammation thing right so do you also talk to your patients about maybe diet or anything like that or that other side so you want to avoid of course alcohol oh yeah avoid out you got to avoid the alcohol so that's possible with the laser light coming up or you can drink get the laser drink get the laser drink a hot and spicy foods oh you know hot chicken wings or say that's a hot cup of coffee you want to stay away from saunas hot tubs things like that will make it worse so you can start that after the fourth of July or just go see dr. Graf in his office so thank you for being here you know a lot of people yeah this is this is it either you you get red or you don't get rid guys that wraps it up for us I'm going to send it back to you all right Chris",

        "transcript": "if you've got red skin and you're blushing very easily you might have rosacea this video I'll help you understand what rosacea is what causes it how it can be treated and where you can find more information about it so first of all what is rosacea well it's a common skin condition that mainly affects the face it usually appears in fair skin people but it can show up in any skin type now it can start at any age but it's most common in young adults whilst it's more common in women it tends to be more severe in men now racea is a long-term condition that can vary from mild to severe and typically it affects the cheeks the forehead the chin and the nose sometimes it can even affect the neck and the chest now rosacea shows up as persistent redness small bumps and pus filled spots that look like acne it can also cause redness and irritation in the eyes and eyelids now the exact cause of rosacea isn't fully understood it seems to be related to genetics immune system issues and environmental factors triggers like alcohol exercise extreme temperatures hot drinks spicy foods and stress can make it worse and people with rosacea are often more sensitive to the sun now rosacea can run in families but there's no clear genetic links so in terms of the symptoms of rosacea well it can cause a rash and blushing that might make you feel embarrassed can lower your self-esteem and it can even lead to anxiety or depression now the affected skin can feel very hot or sting some people with rosacea may also have eye problem problems like inflammation of the front part of the eye which can cause blurred vision if you've got symptoms affecting your eyes it's important to see a dermatologist or an optician now in terms of what it looks like it often starts with a tendency to blush easily over time the central areas of the face can turn a Deeper Shade of red with small dilated blood vessels bumps and pus filled spots in some cases the facial skin can swell especially around the eyes men might experience an overgrowth of the oil secreting glands on the nose causing it to become enlarged and red a condition that's called ryer now how is it diagnosed well usually it's diagnosed based on its appearance you don't typically need any specific tests and once there's no cure for rosacea longterm treatments can help manage it so in terms of treatments there are several ways to manage and treat rosacea starting off with topical treatments now you can apply medications to the affected areas to control inflammation it might take at least least 8 weeks to see the full effects however now some treatments specifically Target the redness Associated rosacea on the other hand there are oral antibiotics for moderate to severe Rosacea antibiotics can help with inflammation common antibiotics include tetracycline doxcycline and aryin your doctor might also suggest using the cream and the oral antibiotic together at the same time in terms of other treatments well for eye problems an eye specialists can help manage severe eye issues that are related to this in terms of the nose issues a dermatologist or plastic surgeon can reduce the enlarged nose in terms of redness and blood vessels laser therapy can help treat redness and dilated blood vessels and for blushing beta blockers or clonidine might be prescribed in severe cases isotretinoin tablets are sometimes used now there are some things you can do at home as well to help manage your Rosia and we'll cover this briefly now so i' encourage you to use a sunblock with an SPF of at least 30 every day I'd encourage you to gently cleanse your skin so avoid rubbing or scrubbing your face very hard and then use a gentle soap substitute try to use a non-perfumed moisturizer if your skin is dry or sensitive and try keep a diary of what worsens your rosacea and try to avoid those triggers you can also use makeup to cover rosacea and skin camouflage can help hide excessive redness finally it's worth avoiding using acne treatments and cortico steroid creams unless these are specifically been recommended by your health provider now the final thing to mention is that some medicines can worsen blushing your doctor might adjust your medication accordingly if this is the case now for more detailed information and additional resources please check out the links in the description box of the video and as ever thanks for watching until next time bye",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "description": "What causes rosacea? How do different factors such as sun exposure, diet, the environment, and genetics contribute to rosacea?",
        "published_at": "2023-05-07T19:00:13Z",
        "transcript": "hey everyone welcome back to the channel I'm Dr John Barbieri I'm a board-certified dermatologist and acne and rosacea expert in this video I want to break down rosacea what causes it who gets it and how can we treat it well let's start by thinking about what causes rosacea and who gets it so rosacea is most common in those over 30 people in their 40s and 50s are often where rosaceous starts as more common in women than men in rosacea we think there are a few different factors that can lead to it the microbiome likely plays a big role we know that people with certain kinds of mites on their skin especially demon X mites can be predisposed to rosacea and treatments that focus on that can be effective in addition the Sun and UV radiation play a big role in the development of rosacea and this is why sun protection is so critical and then genetics have an important role to play here as well we know that rosacea is associated with inflammation and Vascular sensitivity the blood vessels being overreactive in the skin things like catholicitis ll-37 toll like receptor 2 and mast cells these inflammatory Pathways play an important role in rosacea and people who have a tendency to over activation these Pathways may be predispose to gang rosacea people who have vascular reactivity whose blood vessels are sensitive to different kinds of triggers and inflammation are also potentially more likely to get rosacea and that may be why we see rosacea as associated with other conditions that are thought to have a vascular reactivity component like migraine headaches so we've touched on what causes rosacea what about triggers for rosacea well if we think back to that underlying pathogenesis of why rosacea happens in the first place we can really think about what a lot of the key triggers of rosacea are going to be sun is a classic trigger of rosacea so we know that UV radiation is a big player in the development of race Asia so of course exposure to the sun could be a factor that could exacerbate that could make rosacea flare in addition things like alcohol spicy foods heat things that kind of open up the blood vessels can all lead to more fleshing and symptoms of radiation as well and I think that makes sense when we think back to that issue of vascular hyperreactivity that we see in rosacea and then exercise kind of along the same Pathways as another classic trigger of rosacea and finally people with rosacea skin tend to have a lot of sensitivity Skin Barrier dysfunction and many cosmeceutical products or other skin care products mean irritating so we have to be very careful and trying to pick products that are gentle and are not irritated to the skin before we get into specific treatments for the different types of rosacea let's talk about just general rosacea skin care that's going to apply to any kind of rosacea so we talked about how important UV radiation is into causing rosacea so everybody with rosacea really should be using a good sunscreen daily at least SPF 30 to 50. sometimes if that sunscreen has other ingredients in it like niacinamide that can help calm the skin that can be helpful as well Beyond sunscreen we also want to make sure we're helping the Skin Barrier so using a good moisturizer daily often things that hyaluronic acid can feel really nice on the skin or things with some niacinamide can help in rosacea your prone skin as well so that's another critical part of General rosacea skin care and then finally being thoughtful about your own personal triggers we talked about some of the triggers for rosacea if you notice that certain things flare your rosacea being thoughtful about how can I avoid those triggers or reduce them especially when I don't want to be experiencing the symptoms of rosacea can be helpful as well when we think about classifying rosacea it really falls into three main types there's redness and flushing there's bumps papules and pustules and then there's a growth on the nose called biminous changes and you can have any mixture of these three types some people have just one some people have all three together and this is really important to understand your rosacea type because certain treatments work well for one thing but not well for the other let's start with redness and flushing so what's going on here is we have that vascular hyperreactivity those blood vessels are dilated they're too open there's too much blood flow to the skin and so the skin starts to get a red appearance and sometimes with burning and stinging so if we want to treat this we need to either get rid of those blood vessels or we need to help them calm down in terms of getting rid of them that's where our vascular lasers can be helpful so post-diser KTP laser or other energy-based devices like intense pulse light can be helpful to selectively Target those overreactive blood vessels in the skin those fixed talangectages as broken blood vessels on the skin to get rid of them so that's one of our effective treatments these can often give a durable Improvement where you do several sessions of treatment and that redness in those two languages are durably last for a period of time often many years we also can try to physically destroy some of those Challenger tasers those broken blood vessels on the skin using a technique called electrodesication or sclerotherapy where we physically destroy them on the medication side of things there are two creams one's called oxymetazoline and one's called bramonidine they both work the same way the general idea here is if we can tell those overreactive blood vessels that squeeze down to clamp down we will reduce blood flow to the skin and we can reduce that fleshing and Vascular hyperreactivity both of these can give a temporary Improvement in redness in general oxymetazoline I would say is preferable because it doesn't seem to cause rebound so with bramonidine sometimes is that eight to ten hours of redness reduction wears off there can be a brief period where the redness is actually worse than where it started and fortunately we don't see this with oxymetazoline the other thing we've noticed in the clinical trials of these treatments is that if you do them consistently it seems like it may teach the blood vessels to be less reactive and cause actually a permanent or a durable decrease in redness in addition to that transient temporary effect for more severe redness or flushing we can use beta blockers so pills by mouth that again try to help tell those blood vessels to calm down to be less overreactive and for patients with really severe fleshing or burning or singing they can be very valuable treatments moving on to the bumps of papules and pustules of rosacea this is where often our treatments are directed at the microbiome at the skin microorganisms that we know can contribute to rosacea metronidazole is our classic topical treatment for rosacea papules and pustules and it works very well however there are some newer treatments like Ivermectin that have been shown in head-to-head trials for better than metronidazole for treating the bumps of rosacea there's also now a benzoyl peroxide that we can use to treat rosacea classically we've tried to avoid benzyl peroxide and rosacea because it can be irritating and people with rosacea prone skin tend to have very sensitive skin and have trouble with benzoyl peroxide but if we encapsulate that benzoyl peroxide we micro encapsulated that causes it to be released more slowly onto the skin and these micro encapsulate benzyl peroxides in clinical trials seem Not to cause irritation for people on rosacea prone skin and can help treat those bumps those papules and pustules we also have washes like sulfur washes that can be helpful and for for some more severe bumps for more severe patches and postures that aren't responding to topical treatments that's where some of our systemic medications like oral antibiotics or like isotradino and Accutane can help with these bumps and then finally moving on to five minutes changes these gross on the nose where the nose becomes thicker and full of the sebaceous tissue here often we need to use either pill treatments like oral antibiotics like doxycycline or Minocycline or isotradone because it can be very difficult to treat these feminist changes with topical therapies and for some where these sinus changes have really progressed and become disfiguring we can use surgical treatments to help try to correct the appearance of the skin and to undo the damage from these feminist changes so thanks for watching I hope you found this video helpful for more acting rosacea content check out our Channel and if you found this useful

        "transcript": "let's talk about rosacea this used to be called acne rosacea but perhaps because of the confusion with the other type of acne called acne vulgaris which presents in teenagers and in women with hormonal imbalance the name was simplified to rosacea rosacea is common in areas such as your forehead your nose the cheeks and the chin it can present with persistent flushing which is where your face might feel quite warm and hot you would also have redness of the face where for example redness of the cheeks and dilation of your blood vessels known as what we call telegentasia and you might also notice possible spots which is what we call papules and posters and some people they can also have eye involvement where you might get contractivitis blepharitis which is inflammation of the eyelids where you might also have a gritty sensation of the eyes some people can have dry eyes and it can also present with redness of the eyes and you might have lumps and eyelids known as a calzone rosacea is more common in fair skin types so you might not get it in black people such as myself and it's also common in the ages between 40 to 60 and More in women than in men rosacea is thought to be caused by several factors possibly genetic factors because it is said to run in some families we might have mom having it daughter having it siblings as well but there has been no genetic link found so far for the causes of rosacea it is also thought to be due to your immune system where you might have an autoimmune reaction can also be due to environmental factors such as sun exposure extreme hot and cold weather hot strings such as coffee drinking caffeine spicy foods as well as stress now rosacea is a chronic condition which means there is no cure so treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms so in terms of treatments we do have a whole variety of what we call topical treatments such as brimwood in gel metronidazole gel which is something that I'm familiar with so for example if you presented to me with erythema which is redness of the face as well as the possible spots I'll be giving you metronidazole 0.75 percent gel to apply twice a day other treatments include topical Ivermectin as well as azaleaic acid 0.15 gel which is also used for acne level garage but can also be used for rosacea these gels are quite effective for mild symptoms where you have your possible spots and redness of the skin as well as your dilatation of your blood vessels but you would have to use treatment for maybe between 8 to 12 weeks before you can see a resolution of your symptoms if your symptoms are quite bad we would sometimes add an alternative treatment such as an antibiotic which is taken orally such as your erythromycin Clarithromycin and your class of tetracycline such as your doxycycline or oxide tetracycline and this treatment similar to your topical treatments can be used for another 8 to 12 weeks and you might find that in total use actually using this treatment for up to 16 weeks but it's quite important that you have a review of your doctor at each stage just to make sure that the treatment is working if treatment is not working then your doctor would usually refer you to a dermatologist for further treatment so doctor what can I do to help myself in terms of self-help techniques as I mentioned previously sun exposure is one of the risk factors so you might want to protect your skin by using a sun protection factor of at least 30 on your face every day try and avoid using soaps or perfumed products to wash your face as we mentioned extremes of heat or cold can worsen rosacea so you want to avoid heat or sunlight as much as possible avoid cold weather you know try and reduce your intake of alcohol avoid hot drinks whenever you can and importantly avoid stress stress is known to trigger rosacea one thing I forgot to mention which is quite important in rosacea is it can actually cause enlargement of the nose where you get this thickening and inflammation of the nose known as rhinophyma this can usually be treated with a course of Doxycycline which can be taken for up to 16 weeks if that doesn't help there is the option of laser treatment or even minor surgery now I hope you find this short talk on rosacea quite useful and please feel free to subscribe to my channel foreign",

        "transcript": "are you struggling with facial redness postural spots or just irritated skin keep watching to learn a holistic approach to rosacea on its treatment in today's video if you're new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret known may be considered it's a powerful retinoid medication that's often used to treat severe acne but it can also be effective in treating rosacea it's only prescribed in specialist centers if you have difficulty accessing and appropriately qualified medical professional there are online Dermatology Services who can assess your skin where you upload photographs and describe your symptoms a dermatologist then assesses your individual case and prepares a personalized blend of topical treatments suitable for your condition and your skin type I use dermatica for my own personalized night cream and contains a retinoid and a pigment reducer signing up with them at dermatica.com or demonica.co.uk and entering the code Dr Finbar on checkout means you'll get a 10 discount of any products that you purchase so rosacea can be a challenging condition to manage but by looking out for your emotional health make an appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments you can take control over your skin and enjoy a better quality of life if these methods alone don't get you the desired results have a look on their Monica's websites for personal treatment plans or visit an appropriately trained Healthcare professional don't let rosacea hold you back you deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your skin now if you found this video helpful watch this short video on how we can start start

        "transcript": "my name is Cindy wasup and I am a fellow of the new age skin Research Foundation I am here today with Dr Joshua Fox founder and medical director of Advanced Dermatology PC as well as president of the new age skin Research Foundation Dr Fox is a leading Authority in the field of Dermatology and an official spokesperson for the American Academy of Dermatology as well as a former board member for the national rosacea Foundation thank you very much for being with us Dr Fox thank you Cindy for inviting me today we will be discussing rosacea a condition that affects over 14 million Americans Dr Fox what exactly is rosace first of all I Cindy I think it's so important that we're highlighting this very prevalent condition rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease that tends to affect people generally between ages 35 to 50 and it's often with papules pules and and diffuse redness of the face it can affect the eyes it's mostly on the mid facial area what exactly causes rosacea Dr Fox while there is no known cause there have been many theories one of the theories is that it was caused by microorganisms whether a helico Bor or whether it's caused by a Demodex ficuum these mostly have fallen into disfavor and they're not thought to be the cause now however there are cases where people have had these and they've treated these microorganisms and it has improved and perhaps in some way they are responsible some other people think it's a de degenerative collagen disease or vascular disease clearly the vessels are much more um affected by minor stimuli as many of the cases occur in women as they're approaching the the per menopausal area so there there seems to be many many factors associated with it and there are many other theories however these these are some of the more common theories Dr Fox friends of mine with rosacea complain about the rosacea being triggered by certain things what are some known trigger factors for rosacea there are many precipitating factors however the factors vary between Patient to Patient uh the national racea Foundation has an excellent um patient handout on common precipitating factors some of the more common ones include certain foods like spicy foods or a lot of times things with tomato sauce and many patients in certain in certain patients foods with nitrates like salamis certain patients foods with acidity uh stress is a common factor other common precipitant Sy include alcohol change in weather emotional ability that can also sometimes precipitate it for many patients who gets rosacea are you predisposed if you're a certain age or nationality as we stated before rosacea is a very common disease with over 14 million Americans having it although most don't realize they have it it can occur in any ethnicity however it is much more common of those with fair skin it tends to Ur between the ages of 30 to 60 women get it twice as common as men however the disease is worse often times in the M what are some of the signs and symptoms that a person may have rosacea first let's define what it means by sign and symptom a sign is something that a doctor notices a symptom is something that the patient notices so therefore the signs the doctor notices is is a paple which is like a little uh pimple which may be filled with pus uh a a pusle which is rather puls filled with pus uh red red red blood vessels that are coed into the skin diffuse aemma they may develop eye symptoms uh keratitis these are the some of the things that that a doctor whether it be a dermatologist or an opthalmologist May notice now the symptoms are those which the patient feels the patient may feel flushing warmth uh they may feel um burning itching a pulling on the skin they may even find it painful in fact migraines are two to three times more common in patients with rosacea and ocular keratitis can even rarely cause blindness so there are some rare symptoms that can have pretty severe effect effects another common rare effect that people can get is the Rhino the enlarged nose how long does rosacea last and it can can it be prevented altogether rosacea is a long-term disease and it can lasts till persons in their mid-60s although there are even cases rarely where it can even last longer can it be prevented we have no known way to prevent the disease however we as we' discussed previously there are certain precipitating factors and therefore we should try to avoid those precipitating factors for example sunscreen May lessen the effect of the sun uh people that are stressed they should try to be more calm if going into from cold to hot or hot to cold affects the person they should try to make it a more gradual change it's also important Cindy to be gentle with your skin as if you're overly harsh with with with to your skin and may also promote our precipitate in another episode is there a cure for rosacea or at least a treatment to control it dayto day fortunately Cindy there are many excellent new therapies many of them just around 10 years old these include topical antibiotics oral antibiotics topical retinoids oral retinoids like acutane 13 C noic acid emal such as nerel cream and as well as uh azolic acid and and U metronidazol topical metronidazol so there's many new therapies however some of the old therapies such as uh sodium s sulfacetamide and precipitated sulfur and salicylic acid are often helpful in help in treatment of this condition patients sometimes try to treat their own rosacea and end up exacerbating it what do patients do wrong I think the first mistake is that many patients view this as their being that this is part of them and that therefore they don't need to seek treatment or shouldn't seek treatment for it that it may be considered cosmetic every insurance company in the United States considers this to be a medical problem which deserves medical therapy and most medical therapies are very very effective from the topical antibiotics to all the creams that I mentioned previously and therefore we can treat them and be very successful most of the time and only require laser and those patients who are resistant to the more simple therapies so therefore the first and most important point is that they should seek care from an appropriate dermatologist who is familiar with this condition and if necess necessary from a dermatologic laser surgeon who's capable of treating some of the resistant sequel of this disease are conditioned how exactly can lasers help rosacea patients this is a very important point that you're making lasers can help different aspects of the rosacea the different aspects that the lasers can help is the vascular component the redness of the face the broken blood vessels and some of the pap that's the lasers that help that part of the disease however a patient with a large thicken nose there's different lasers that we have to help the Rhino Fus component we're able to layer the nose back to normal as you said earlier Dr Fox rosacea sometimes presents with red papules and patients sometimes confuse this for with acne what's the real difference between rosacea and acne that's a good question there are really two completely different diseases however they do share some common threads such as papules pules however acne tends to have Comon which we do not find in rosacea and there are many other differences which are really beyond the scope of this discussion thank you very much for joining us today Dr Fox thank you so much for asking me and thank you so much for all your hard work on helping the many patients with rosacea",

        "published_at": "2023-02-03T17:00:28Z",
        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about a common skin condition that affects so many people including myself it's called rosacea we're going to be talking about the symptoms the triggers and the best treatment options for how to manage your rosacea I'm Dr Hannah koppelman I'm here to provide you with skin care advice I'm going to provide you with honest information on how to keep your skin looking healthy and Flawless if you're new to my channel don't forget to like subscribe and share like many other skin conditions unfortunately rosacea is just another chronic skin condition that causes your face to look red and irritated it typically affects the central face so what that means is you'll usually see rosacea in the cheek area the forehead the nose sometimes even around the brows and the chin it is so common that it affects over 16 million Americans that means one in every 20 patients has rosacea so you're not alone before we go deeper into rosacea if you're at home watching this and you're someone who is affected by rosacea unfortunately I don't have a magical and permanent cure to treating it however I do have recommendations and tips for how to manage it to make it a lot better if you're someone with rosacea I'm sure you've experienced how this condition can really Wax and Wane so I'm sure there's days when you wake up and you're like yay my rosacea is gone my face is clear I'm so happy unfortunately there are days when you're going to wake up and your rosacea is flaring that is just how this condition is it waxes it wanes it can be good some days and bad others but there's ways to control it so rosacea can affect both men and women however it typically affects women who are light-skinned and it really starts around your 30th birthday however you can also see it later in life so it can start anywhere between your 30s and your 50s if you're at home watching this and affected by rosacea then you probably have one of the signs and symptoms I'm about to share with you I do want to mention the clinical presentation signs and symptoms can really vary between person to person and so can the severity so I want to go through this list with you because if you're someone with rosacea it's most likely that you have at least one of the things I'm about to mention first and foremost usually you'll have facial redness we also call this erythema or irritation you can also get this waxing and weaning like I mentioned so some days it might look good and some days it might be not so good it's also possible that your face might become very flushed or blushed easily now another very common sign and symptom of rosacea is developing red bumps usually they develop in the cheek area or the nose area and sometimes these are called papules and sometimes they're even filled with push which is when they're called pustules this is very often misdiagnosed and mistreated as acne that's why you really need a specialist in order to determine if your condition is rosacea so that you get the proper treatment very often people have visible dilated blood vessels on the surface of their skin these are also called telen dictages when you have rosacea it's very possible that you also experience some other symptoms like tingling irritation itchiness and just some discomfort you might even have a burning sensation with rosacea it's also possible to get thickening of the skin around your nose now there's one more thing with rosacea I want to mention it's very possible to get rosacea around the eyes this is actually called ocular rosacea you can get this itchy burning sensation almost like a grittiness in your eye and it feels like an eyelash is stuck in there now there is some overlap between Rosie ocular rosacea and allergies so again something that a specialist really needs to diagnose you with the exact cause of rosacea is unclear but what we do know is that there are common stimuli that can trigger it first and foremost is sun exposure hot and cold temperatures hot and cold drinks hot showers or hot baths these are all not great for your rosacea this evening includes coffee and hot tea also stress not great for your rosacea as well even chocolate alcohol spicy foods sometimes even Dairy can trigger your rosacea now don't go crazy here I'm not telling you to take away all those things out of your diet in life my motto is everything in moderation it might be helpful for you to keep a journal or a little log of what triggers your rosacea that way you can avoid it now I want to share with you a story about my best friend about two to three years ago around his 30th birthday he came up to me and he told me he had this red annoying rash on his face it would get flaky and he always knew it was coming on because he would get some tingling around his nose he asked me what it was was he doing something wrong was he putting something on his face was he eating something that was bad for him he did notice that it would flare with stress or when he would work out really hard and get hot like in a hot spin class or a hot yoga class He also mentioned that some days he would wake up with his skin looking beautiful and clear and then other days he would know that a flare was coming because he would get that weird Sensation that burning stinging sensation and he knew he was about to get a rosacea flare I explained to him what he had was rosacea which was likely contributed by a combination of both genetic and environmental factors which unfortunately is out of our control but I told him I had ways and tips to help him manage it so now when he feels a flare is about to come on he ramps up his rosacea regiment and he nips it in the butt before it gets worse so today I want to help you do the same it's important to know that treating rosacea is not a one-size-fits-all approach because there's such variability in symptoms and signs of how your rosacea might look or appear or feel there's also variation in how you treat it and you might have to try different treatment options before you find the one that best suits you now you're probably getting really sick of me telling you this but sunscreen is so important we know that sun exposure is one of the number one triggers for rosacea therefore it's so important to start your day with a daily SPF and protect your skin if you're someone who likes to cover up your rosacea when you go to work or school or go out for the night I recommend using a foundation that either has a light green or a yellow tint to it this will blend really well and counteract that erythema or redness on your face now there are some things that I want you to avoid if you have rosacea first and foremost are obviously those noticeable and obvious triggers that you know are causing your rosacea to be worse so if you're someone that eats spicy food and your rosacea goes crazy then maybe try to cut back on the spicy food but in addition to this avoid scrubbing the face with astringent harsh chemical products harsh exfoliants acids or chemical peels you don't want to cause more irritation to an already red face try to stick with the products that are more sensitive and gentle so for example I highly recommend using Vani cream sensitive face moisturizer I use this every single day in my skincare routine it is very gentle and it will keep your face moist throughout the day if you're someone who struggles with ocular rosacea I recommend using artificial eye teardrops and wiping your eyelids with this wipe you can also use warm water this will really reduce the inflammation around your eyes now let's narrow down on how to best treat the rosacea on your face this requires a prescription to control it so first and foremost try metronidazole either in a cream or a gel form the cream might work better for you or the gel might work better for you you have to try and see I also recommend acetylic acid sodium sulfactamide and sulfur cleansers sometimes if your rosacea is really flaring and you just can't get it under control with the topical therapies or you're just not satisfied with how it looks you might need to try a course of oral antibiotics usually this is with Doxycycline you'll be on it for about two to three months I know you're probably like two to three months of antibiotics that sounds like a really long time but it really helps your rosacea once you come off that course of antibiotics you want to continue the maintenance with a topical therapy because as I said rosacea is a chronic skin condition and if you just stop all your therapies all at once your rosacea is just going to come right back now one more thing I want to mention that I have found really helpful in treating rosacea and it's a more permanent fix it's an in-office device called a pulsed Dye Laser PDL for short and this is really good for rosacea for the redness and if you're someone with those dilated blood vessels on your nose or your cheeks or even your forehead I've seen this work really well it's very effective sometimes it requires three treatments and it's a very long lasting so that's a wrap I hope I provided you with tips and guidelines on how to best manage your rosacea if you have any questions leave them in the comments below and don't forget to hit the Subscribe button and give this video a thumbs up I'll see you in the next video",

        "transcript": "well hey guys how do you tell the difference between acne and rosacea in today's video I'm going to explain to you exactly how to do that now if you're dealing with redness and painful pimples breakouts you might think you have acne but you could actually have rosacea they look very similar as I've said before not everything that looks like acne is acne and rosacea is pretty darn common and the reason it's so important to tell the difference and know what you're dealing with is because the approach to treating each condition is very different and in order to get good control of either condition you've got to know what it is you are dealing with when it comes to acne the signature skin lesion the spot that is very characteristic of acne is called a Comey Dome basically a plugged up pore now that comidone can have a black spot in it or it can present as a white bump these are commonly referred to as blackheads and whiteheads but the medical term for them is open and closed comedones but with acne you can also have Painful nodules and cysts and you can have red bombs that fill with pus as referred to as pustules in contrast with rosacea you can have red spots you can have pustules but there are no comedones no blackheads no white heads people with rosacea they can have very prominent pores but the pores are not clogged poor clogging is not a part of rosacea both acne and rosacea present with facial redness but where the redness is located is different in each condition with acne the redness tends to be confined around the breakouts whereas with rosacea the redness is more widespread covering the cheeks the nose the forehead the chin with rosacea the redness can come and go with acne the redness pretty much goes along with the breakout and it may last long after the breakout has healed that's referred to as post acne erythema now I have a whole video explaining that and how to get rid of that so check that video out and in the beginning with rosacea the redness actually comes and goes but with time if the rosacea is not kept under good control that redness can persist and be there all the time fixed facial redness acne affects the skin rosacea affects the skin and it often can affect the eyes this can appear with bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids swollen eyelids dry eyes and The Sensation of like grittiness in the eyes that is a very important distinction over half of people who have rosacea have involvement of their eyes a trigger for acne is an increase in oil production and people who have acne often tend to have oily skin not 100 of them do but many of them do because the oiliness really feeds the little bacteria that live in the Skin Within the pore and that all leads to inflammation rosacea on the other hand is not necessarily an oily skin condition sure you may have a genetic tendency towards oiliness along with rosacea but the oiliness is not playing a role in rosacea so treatments that address oiliness will not improve the rosacea whereas treatments that address oiliness can help improve acne another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea is what happens when you do nothing when you do nothing with acne the consequence Downstream is that it can heal with a scar there are a lot of different types of acne scars I have videos on this channel as to the different types of acne scars the different treatments for these scarves as a reminder you can have a raised SCAR or you can have a depressed scar acne can also heal with a dark mark or a red mark post acne redness post acne hyperpigmentation rosacea on the other hand left untreated left uncontrolled the consequence of that is that the individual can go on to experienced persistent facial redness that does not go away they also can develop prominent dilated blood vessels and in some cases although pretty rare it is also possible to develop skin thickening in the areas involved with the rosacea this is referred to as feminist change often can involve the nose but it can really affect anywhere on the face where you've got rosacea flares chin forehead in contrast to acne climate as change is not a scar but as you can see it's important to treat both conditions because there are consequences that are long-lasting when the conditions are not appropriately managed another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea are the symptoms acne especially cystic acne can be very very painful but a lot of times acne can also itch rosacea on the other hand is a skin condition where one of the Hallmark findings is the fact that patients are exquisitely sensitive to things that come in contact with the skin whether that be makeup sunscreen perfume skin care products other Cosmetics they're also exquisitely sensitive to the Sun as well as to wind and to just really anything coming in contact with the skin and this leads to symptoms of burning stinging sometimes itch sometimes discomfort sometimes a feeling of heat in the skin when you're asking yourself is this acne or is this rosacea pay attention to the location where you are breaking out acne tends to affect the forehead the cheeks the nose it can affect the neck the upper chest and the upper back as well as the shoulders whereas rosacea tends to affect the mid face like the cheeks over the nose it can also affect the forehead and the chin it can extend to involve the scalp and it also can involve the neck the upper chest and the upper back the people who get acne are a little different from the people who get rosacea although there is some overlap people who get acne most commonly are in their teens are tweens but truthfully you can develop acne at any age including in a newborn and adults as a side note recently I did a whole video on acne in your 40s and above so check that one out we explain why you are still breaking out breaking out for the first time as an adult acne affects all Races all skin tones rosacea on the other hand while it really could occur at any age generally speaking it impacts adults 30 years of age and above of course there are exceptions to that but it generally is a disease that first presents in adulthood all Races can be affected by rosacea it is generally taught that rosacea is a lot more common in people who have paler skin types I have always questioned this because I do think that and people who have a deeper skin tone it's very easy to miss a diagnosis of rosacea because the redness of rosacea can be very subtle in a deeper skin tone so getting a really good history for my patient with a deeper skin tone and always considering rosacea as a possibility is super important I think a lot of patients who have deeper skin tones might accidentally be misdiagnosed as having acne if you don't have blackheads and whiteheads and you also have symptoms of Exquisite sensitivity burning stinging if you feel as though your eyes are are being impacted you've got bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids a feeling of like something in your eye you might actually have rosacea I want to interject why it's so important to distinguish the two accurately because the treatment for one could potentially worsen the other condition so that's why why an accurate diagnosis is King taking a step back let's let's talk about what causes acne as opposed to what causes rosacea the causes are different both conditions likely have an underlying genetic component we can always blame our genetics oh officer I was going 10 miles over the speed limit because it's my genetics it's just in my DNA I digress all right when it comes to acne there are a few factors playing a role acne is a condition where the sebaceous oil gland plays a major role as I mentioned earlier with acne you have an increase in sebum output that is largely governed by genetics again as well as your hormones um whereas rosacea there is no issue going on with the sebaceous oil gland putting out more oil so there's you know that takes that out of the equation with acne you also have a problem with the cells lining the pore not turning over efficiently they kind of get stuck together and that's what leads to those comedones blackheads and whiteheads with rosacea that's not what's going on and with acne as a consequence of the plugging up of the pore and the increase in sebum you have another little Factor down there in your pore called cutie bacterium acne that is a part of everyone's skin but when it's down there in an acne pore and within that comidone and with all that extra sea bomb it starts snacking on that breaks it down into something that triggers a lot of inflammation and that's what leads to painful acne cysts think of rosacea on the other hand as a problem that is a neurosensory issue where you have little nerves that go through your skin and for whatever reason in rosacea the working idea is that the nerves in rosacea release inflammatory mediators apparently upon exposure to otherwise innocuous things that can lead to blood vessel dilation with rosacea there's also some degree of local skin immune dysregulation now in acne I mentioned there's a little bacteria that lives on everyone's skin who is kind of to blame for some of the acne symptoms while that character cutie bacterium acnes is not playing a role in rosacea there is another Little Critter that likely plays a major role in a lot of people's rosacea and that is Demodex mites Demodex are part of everyone's natural skin biology but it's thought that for people who have rosacea they have an abnormal inflammatory response to that little Mite or they have an overabundance of that little mind so you'll see that some of the treatments for rosacea actually specifically Target that part of rose Asia namely ivermecta and topical Ivermectin sold the brand name for that is cilantro so the root causes of acne and rosacea are much different and the things that trigger an acne flare are very different from the things that trigger a rosacea flare with acne you can get a flare from changes in your hormones this is especially the case when you have acne as an adult adult women with acne breakouts a lot of it can be influenced by changes in the hormones the Androgen hormones signal to the oil gland make more oil and that can lead to acne breakouts with acne you also have things that you put on your skin can potentially trigger acne flares if they are comedogenic now skin care products are not formulated to be comedogenic but sometimes sometimes patients find that certain products lead to worsening of acne aggravate their acne especially the kids with very heavy oily Cosmetics or heavy oily hair care products like oily pomades are known to trigger comedones on the forehead or the sides of the face face where the hair touches medications and supplements can trigger acne certain diets may play a role in someone's tendency to have more stubborn acne I I have a video all about a clear skin diet and foods that researchers believe may play a role in acne but suffice it to say the full story on how our foods and diets impact an individual's tendency towards acne are not fully elucidated and acne can have an interesting response to sun exposure some people find that their acne actually calms down a bit with sun exposure but it's clear that acne can get a lot worse after sun exposure likely because exposure to the sun is immunosuppressive but you can get this rebound worsening of acne now rosacea on the other hand let's unpack the triggers there do hormones influence rosacea they probably do to a certain extent but there's not that underlying issue of Androgen hormones driving oil production and leading to to flares that's specific to acne not really it's not a major driving force although you may find that your skin is even more sensitive active with changes in hormones for example changes and hormone profiles around your menstrual cycle may make your skin overall more sensitive more prone to redness skin care products Cosmetics fragrances things that come in contact with the skin are notorious for triggering rosacea and I always get a lot of questions like what skin care products are off limits for rosacea a lot of it really is highly variable and very unique to the individual but in general things like Menthol fragrance ingredients that have cinnamon cinnamaldehyde these can actually trigger vasodilation and worsen redness now heavy moisturizers in rosacea actually can trigger a flare much different from how heavy greasy products might aggravate acne by potentially poor clogging with rosacea a really really heavy moisturizer may actually make you feel a little overheated because it might slow down the evaporate operation of sweat and as you start to feel overheated your body's response to that is going to be to flush and so it can trigger a flush a flare of rosacea with flushing and blushing which is a Hallmark symptom of rosacea upon exposure to things that are irritating to the skin rosacea definitely can be triggered by many different foods I have a video going into detail about different foods that trigger facial redness if you have rosacea you absolutely need to watch that video because there are some mechanisms there that I think will be very helpful for you to understand spicy foods tend to be a culprit likely through vasodilation a lot of people with rosacea are very sensitive to alcohol triggers a flush not everyone for whatever reason red wine seems to be more of a culprit for a lot of people but again it's very individualized so just pay attention to how your skin responds when you do consume alcohol and consider omitting it completely or perhaps it's a certain type of alcohol that's more of a problem for you you also have to be careful with consuming hot liquids like hot tea hot coffee drinking warm soups because that warmth can precipitate a flush of course again this is not true for everyone but it is a relatively common trigger in rosacea you definitely need to be very cognizant of your sun exposure because UV rays definitely are a notorious trigger for a rosacea flare in general people with rosacea are more sensitive to heat that can be from the environment or from sitting next to a heater once they start getting overheated and flush boom that can trigger trigger a flare of course harsh skin care products excessive cleansing definitely can aggravate rosacea something that is common to both acne and rosacea that a lot of people Miss is the fact that both conditions there is an underlying problem with the Skin Barrier and therefore moisturizing can be beneficial for minimizing symptoms and minimizing flare of both conditions it's just a matter of choosing a moisturizer that works for your skin and doesn't actually aggravate your skin so for acne if you find that certain moisturizers seem to aggravate breakouts then avoid those and go with something that is more lightweight likewise with rosacea pick a moisturizer that is more lightweight it's not going to feel heavy on the skin it's going to you know in most cases for people with rosacea it's best to choose products that are free of fragrance and and common irritants like certain essential oils for example because these ingredients they may actually worsen redness cause vasodilation and precipitate a flare so go really mild really boring really Bland now that you know a little bit about how these two differ hopefully these tips in this video arm you with the information that maybe you can begin to distinguish yourself why do we treat acne why do we treat rosacea it's important to treat acne because regardless of acne severity it can go on to lead to permanent scarring which is what we're really trying to prevent and it also can lead to very stubborn hyperpigmentation and very stubborn redness around the acne breakouts that takes a long time to resolve the other reason to treat acne is because it has a huge impact on your quality of life and a lot of people with acne that is untreated they have a lot of mental health consequences as a result so treating your acne could potentially help with your mental health research it clearly shows that having acne is associated with more symptoms of depression and a lot of acne treatments once initiated and the acne improves there is an improvement in the mental health symptoms so that is another potential benefit and the other reason to treat acne is treating it early prevents further flares treating acne also can help give you some relief from the pain and possible itch of painful acne lesions why treat rosacea it's important to treat rosacea because treating it especially early can prevent you going on to have fixed facial redness it can basically help in preventing it from getting worse can prevent you from going on to develop those prominent dilated blood vessels telangentasias and treating it early can help get you some relief from the most uncomfortable symptoms of flushing blushing burning stinging treating rosacea is also very beneficial for your overall quality of life and again your mental health both acne and rosacea untreated can impact your quality of life and mental health which in and of itself is definitely a reason to pursue treatment the other reason it's important to evaluate and treat rosacea early on is to assess for comorbid eye involvement over half of patients with rosacea will have involvement of their eyes sometimes the eye involvement comes long before the skin symptoms and so untreated the eye involvement can lead to eye problems symptoms in the eyes include bloodshot eyes crusting of the eyelids swollen eyelids itchy dry eyes and if not those symptoms persist then that inflammation in the eye can have consequences for your eye health so evaluating rosacea early on in the course and looking for possible eye involvement and treating and addressing that appropriately through you know referral to referral to an ophthalmologist if necessary is really important now I encourage you to see a board-certified dermatologist for evaluation and management so that you can not only ensure that you have the right diagnosis but that you're on the best treatment plan for you treating acne treating rosacea it's not a cookbook approach everyone's acne differs everyone's rosacea differs and what's going to be an appropriate treatment for one person is simply not going to be right for another person it's not a cookbook approach you know you don't take a patient with rosacea and say if rosacea then X Y and Z it's not that algorithmic some things are going to be better options depending on overall symptoms skin lesions severity all sorts of the factors go into go into picking the best treatment for either acne or rosacea anyways guys I hope this video was helpful in laying out how to distinguish acne from rosacea how they differ hopefully gave you a clear understanding that the treatment approaches need to be much different and they're tailored to the root causes of both conditions now as I mentioned I have a video on foods that cause facial redness I'm going to link that on the end slate make sure you watch that if you are dealing with facial redness of any form including related to rosacea because you will identify potentially certain foods that may be aggravating it if you guys enjoyed this video though give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye thank you [Music]",

        "transcript": "if you've watched my YouTube channel before you've probably heard me mention that I have rosacea and this is what my rosacea looked like at the height of my flares so today I'm going to be sharing what I did to get my rosacea under control and what I continue to do to keep it that way [Music] if you're new to the channel welcome I'm so happy to have you here I'm Dr Sam Ellis I'm a board certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist in Northern California and I'm here to help you understand your skin and find products that work for you so if that sounds good give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel before I get into my personal rosacea story let's do a quick overview of rosacea so rosacea is a chronic but treatable condition that primarily affects the face and I say treatable rather than curable because there is no known cure for rosacea once you're diagnosed with rosacea it's something that you carry with you typically for the rest of your life to some degree that doesn't mean there aren't good interventions to make it better to reduce the flares to make you more comfortable but if you go into your rosacea treat expecting a cure and to never have to deal with rosacea again that's not the right expectation to have when you think of any chronic medical condition whether or not it affects the skin high blood pressure for example hypothyroidism the thought is that as you continue your medication or the lifestyle interventions that you've pursued to keep your medical condition under control your disease will be well managed however if you come off of your medication or you stop participating in those meaningful lifestyle interventions your disease comes back where it reveals itself again and the same goes for rosacea so many times my patients are on therapy for a few months their rosacea is a lot better and then they want to come off of therapy and that's when we have to have this conversation of we've made you better but in order to maintain the control of rosacea that you're looking for we need to keep you on some type of treatment intervention I think people traditionally think of rosacea as manifesting on the skin as redness easy flushing dilated invisible blood vessels but rosacea can Encompass so much more than that it can show up as pimples or little red bumps on the skin so it's often mistaken are misdiagnosed as acne it also includes things like skin sensitivity burning sensation stinging sensation inability to tolerate a wide variety of topical products and so rosacea is so much more than just redness I also wanted to put this video out there because rosacea affects so many people it's estimated that about 16 million Americans have rosacea and then about 5.5 percent of the global population is affected the other thing that's worth noting is that rosacea is typically misdiagnosed or under-diagnosed in skin of color so rosacea is not just a disease of Caucasian skin or a fair skin people with deeper skin tones or more melanated skin can also have rosacea and with that I think we're ready to delve into my personal rosacea Journey the last thing I'll mention is that what has worked for me and my rosacea may not work for you in your rosacea I think it's nice to see what someone has gone through and all the things I've tried and what has worked and what has not worked so that you understand that it's a process and it's not always like the first thing you try is going to be you're hit it out of the park home run type of treatment but I also think it's really important to recognize that you need to team up with your own personal dermatologist to make sure that the treatments you're doing are right for your rosacea and that you have someone who is a professional who knows your medical history to guide you through your rosacea Journey as well so I was formally diagnosed with rosacea in 2015 and something very pivotal happened in that year I moved from Michigan where I had completed my medical school training at the University of Michigan to Denver Colorado where I was starting my intern year and Denver has a pretty particular climate it has super dry air there is no moisture when you're walking around two it's at elevation so Denver's known as the mile high city it sits at about 5300 feet so you're up closer to the Sun and we know that UV protection goes down the higher up in elevation that you go and also Denver gets these like wild temperature swings where it's like 80 degrees and sunny one day and then the next day it's 32 degrees and snowing and I really think that that climate took a toll on my skin over time also while I was there I was spending a lot lot more time outside I was only in Denver for my intern year and I knew that going in and I wanted to take full advantage of being in an incredibly beautiful nature-filled state and so I was hiking all the time I was going skiing I was spending tons and tons of time Outdoors much more time Outdoors than I did when I was crammed away studying all throughout medical school for the prior four years and so I feel like that combination of the climate plus all of that excess outdoor time kind of did me in now I'm not blaming my rosacea on moving to Denver I absolutely loved living there I have a genetic predisposition to rosacea my father has rosacea I've seen it in some of my aunts and uncles and I had spent a lot of time Outdoors growing up as well getting that excess UV exposure which can predispose you to having manifestations of rosacea later in life I just think at that point in my life I sort of hit an inflection point where all of a sudden my skin was like so I started noticing that I was getting a lot more red so I was easily flushing and then the biggest thing was that my skin felt uncomfortable like I would get these waves of heat and burning in my cheeks and then when I would look in the mirror my skin would be bright red and that had really never happened to me before yes growing up I would flush kind of easily if I got embarrassed or if I exercised really hard that's just normal flushing physiologic flushing but it's that symptom of burning heat that Rising discomfort in your face that really started at that point in time I also began to notice my pores for my whole life I had never really noticed my pores and it was really in that year that when I look in the mirror I'd be like what's going on on my face and it would be almost this subtle swelling and increased poor prominence on my nose on my cheeks on my chin and I'll be first one to tell you as a dermatologist everyone has pores but it was a very abrupt change where I never noticed my pores before to all of a sudden it they almost looked more pronounced and my face had like very mild subtle swelling but really the thing that bothered me the most were sort of these Blooms of heat where seemingly out of nowhere my skin would just become really red and hot and uncomfortable it really wasn't until I saw my dermatologist and she brought up the idea of rosacea that I even considered that I had distinct triggers because she asked me what are your triggers and I was like I don't have any triggers it just happens out of nowhere but then after that visit I really started paying attention and realizing oh every time I go on a long hike or spend a lot of time outdoors and if I haven't been really properly Sun protected my skin feels really hot later in the day or every time I drink alcohol especially wine my skin turns super super red or anytime I sit next to a fireplace or the indoor heating is on too high my skin is on fire and that's when I realized I do have distinct triggers but because these things had also been part of my life for so long I just didn't really pay attention to the fact that they were happening at such specific moments so step one in this journey was getting my rosacea diagnosis and that's a really important step because I've had so many people come into my office thinking that they have rosacea trying to treat their skin as if they have rosacea but they actually have something else going on so before you really embark on your treatment interventions start with the diagnosis because it's only going to respond and get better if you're treating the right thing and the second part of my rosacea journey is treatment what I actually did to get my rosacea better that's probably why you clicked on this video to watch it in the first place so let's talk about my rosacea treatment the number one thing I did to improve my rosacea was limit or in some cases completely avoid my triggers I would venture to say that for most people who have rosacea limiting or avoiding their triggers will be the most impactful intervention that they make when addressing their rosacea however it can also be one of the hardest things to do because it usually involves making some significant changes to your lifestyle and Breaking Habits or changing your lifestyle for a skin condition is a big commitment and you really have to decide when you're going to treat your rosacea how committed to these interventions you want to be and you just have to understand that if you're not willing to avoid your triggers there might be a limit to how much improvement you can get with your rosacea so when it came to my rosacea of course I had to spend some time I done defying my triggers and then I had to really decide which triggers were worth avoiding or limiting and which ones contribute to the richness and the enjoyment of my life and that I'm not willing to sacrifice understanding that if I don't eliminate all of my triggers I will still have some rosacea flares to some degree but they will certainly get better by at least limiting the triggers that I'm willing to cut out I'll give you a couple of examples so I knew that every time I spent time Outdoors whether it was skiing or hiking my skin would feel like crap later in the day it would be really red it would feel like it was throbbing or burning but I also recognized that when I was out doing those activities I wasn't optimally protecting my skin from the Sun or wind I wasn't reapplying my sunscreen as frequently I wasn't really wearing a wide brim hat I was still in like my baseball cap era I also wasn't wearing like a balaclava or something to protect my face from the wind when I was skiing so there was a lot of hits my skin was taking throughout that process so rather than say hey I'm not going to hike or ski or be outside which is I huge passion of mine I love that it brings so much joy to my life I realized I could augment my behavior during those times to make that less of a trigger for me another very clear trigger for my rosacea was alcohol or is alcohol and I feel like at that point in my life I was drinking casually but not a lot but I felt like I could drink a lot less and still be really satisfied with my life and not miss it so now I drink probably somewhere between five and ten alcoholic beverages a year it's just not my personal advice and I feel like my rosacea is so much better I also feel better for loads of other reasons that I don't drink alcohol but I think the effects that it's had on my skin have been tremendously positive now I live in Northern California and if I get invited to go wine tasting with my girlfriends I'm not skipping it I just have to understand that my skin is going to feel kind of crappy for a few days after that event and I have to weigh the pros and cons of that and that's what I ask my patients to do too it's just understand what your limit what your triggers are what you're willing to sacrifice what you aren't and then adjust your life accordingly but trigger avoidance is just one piece of my rosacea treatment puzzle I also changed up my skincare I started prescription treatment I started in office treatment so let's talk a little bit about those the first thing I did is I stopped over washing my skin I feel like my generation was taught that you're supposed to wash your face twice a day and that's a sign of both cleanliness but that's also going to keep your skin healthy but that can actually be quite harsh and stripping especially for those who suffer from rosacea or other conditions of skin sensitivity like atopic dermatitis so I reduced my face washing from twice a day morning and night to just at night in the morning I just get my face wet with water I don't use any type of cleanser or soap and that alone has made my skin feel a lot better staying within the category of skin cleansing another thing I did to really help get my rosacea under control is I stopped using makeup wipes and I started doing a different type of double cleanse in the evening to prepare my skin for the rest of my evening routine the concept of a double cleanse is to perform a two-step cleansing routine in which you wash your face with some type of gentle cleanser and then you wash your face again with a different type of gentle cleanser using a makeup wipe is kind of a double cleanse because you're washing your face with that and then you're doing some other type of cleanser to remove anything else that's left on your face but the makeup wipe isn't particularly gentle especially for me and so when I switch to an alternative double cleanse in which I was using either micellar water a cleansing balm a cleansing oil as my first cleansing step and then following that with a liquid gel cleanser my skin was so much happier Also let's be honest there were plenty of nights where I would just use a makeup wipe and not pursue any further nighttime skincare routine and that certainly wasn't going to make my rosacea better I've tried hundreds of cleansers over the years to this day probably one of my most used first cleansing steps is my bioderma micellar water I sort of think of this as the gentlest makeup remover and if you're in the habit of using makeup wipes I feel like this is a nice transition Shin because it doesn't feel so abrupt if you've never used a cleansing oil or cleansing balm for example because I like to pour my micellar water onto a little cotton round and then swipe it over my face to remove my makeup and my sunscreen at the end of the day and get me prepped for my second cleansing step and that really makes me feel like I'm using a makeup wipe but it's so much more gentle on my skin I then follow this up with a gentle cleanser CeraVe Cetaphil Vanna cream they all make really nice gentle cleansers one thing you'll notice if you suffer with rosacea is that some cleansers will really agree with your skin and some will not and it's not predictable I could recommend one gentle cleanser and you could be like oh that didn't work for my skin at all and another person could try the same cleanser and be like Oh Holy Grail I'm I'm just like you Dr Ellis so it's really important that when you have rosacea that you understand that you might need a little bit of trial and error to find the products that really work well and complement your skin that being said if you have rosacea and you're watching this video and you've found a gentle cleanser that you really love put it in the comments below I think people who suffer from rosacea always need more viable options so I'd love to hear from you another skincare habit I changed once I was diagnosed with rosacea was I became extremely consistent about my sunscreen application over the last eight years there's probably a handful of days that I haven't applied sunscreen and it has just become part of my daily habit so I don't forget it and so my skin is always protected of course there are days that I put my sunscreen on and I never go outside and did I really need sunscreen on that day no but by having it as part of my daily routine my skin always has that Baseline level of protection I also got a lot better about reapplying my sunscreen so anytime I'm out hiking skiing by the pool at the park with my son I'm putting on sunscreen a minimum of every two hours now if I'm inside at work all day at my desk in patient rooms and my reapplying during that time no I kind of have that Baseline protection from the morning and I'm not really getting excess UV exposure but anytime I'm outdoor doors and have true UV exposure consistently sunscreen is getting reapplied super consistently as well if you're looking for a good sunscreen that's going to agree with your skin I have so many videos out there talking about my favorite sunscreens I do want to give a special shout out though to Ulta MD UV physical SPF 41 because this was probably the first sunscreen I ever used consistently like I grew up swimming I would put on my banana boat or my copper tone or whatever as needed but when I was getting into a daily sunscreen habit this was the one I was reaching for I really liked that it had a little bit of a tint and a little bit of a blurring effect so I feel like it makes my skin look better and I really like that it was gentle on my skin even now it's one of my top recommended sunscreens for people who have rosacea or people who have sensitive skin in general sometimes I get asked hey if you have rosacea do you need to use mineral or physical sunscreens or our chemical sunscreens okay and that really varies person to person I for example have rosacea and I can use the whole Spectrum any type of UV filter and I don't really have problems with it other people who have rosacea really like to stick to the mineral sunscreens other people's rosacea really like to stick to the chemical sunscreen so again it's a little bit about testing out some various sunscreens I think it's such a good investment to try sunscreens and figure out what you like because once you land on your Holy Grail sunscreen you can use it for the rest of your life and be so much more protected so I stopped washing my face twice a day I started using a double cleanser I started being consistent with my sunscreen application and reapplication and then the final thing I did for skin protection was I started not just relying on my sunscreen for UV protection but also started wearing a wide brim hat more consistently as well as sunglasses because sunscreen is not fail proof you can still get UV damage even when you apply sunscreen you're not going to apply it perfectly every time you're not going to reapply it perfectly every time so having other ways that you're protecting your skin from the Sun is super important and wide brim hats have been a staple for me also when I hike I will typically bring a bandana so I have one by coolibar which is a company that makes a lot of different Sun protective clothing and I will use it up over my face if I feel like I'm walking on a really reflective surface where sun is not just hitting me from above but it's also bouncing off of concrete and hitting me in the face I also really like having a bandana to wear over my face if it suddenly gets really windy or it's really cold because it's another way that I'm protecting my skin from my rosacea triggers the reason I'm placing so much emphasis on sun protection is because not only is UV radiation a rosacea trigger for me it is the most common trigger for rosacea so over 80 percent of people who suffer from rosacea will have UV exposure as one of their triggers so I just want to give you lots of different options of ways you can protect yourself in addition to those skin care interventions I also use prescription medication to treat my rosacea so let's talk about that next before I talk too much about my prescription interventions I want to be very clear about something because it actually comes up a lot when I talk to my patients about rosacea interventions which is the vast majority of prescription medication that we have for rosacea is good at treating the pimples and bumps that come with rosacea if you have redness if you have flushing those are much harder to treat with medication it's not to say that there aren't some interventions there are both topical and oral medications that can help with that redness and flushing component temporarily but they also come with potential side effects and when I was deciding on how aggressive I wanted to be with treating my rosacea those particular interventions for example topical oxymetazoline or oral quantity to help with flushing didn't really appeal to me my flushing wasn't so bad that I felt like I wanted to be on those particular medications so the prescription medications that I opted to use and those that worked best for me were really to address sort of that poor prominence that slight bit of swelling that slight reactivity of my skin and I used a combination of prescription azelic acid 15 and sodium sulfacetamide sulfur cleanser so that is a prescription sulfur-based cleanser that we can prescribe for people who have rosacea those are the two things I used the most when I was trying to get my rosacea under control which was you know almost a decade ago now now remember how we said in the beginning of the video that there's no cure for rosacea but it can get better or worse over your lifetime based on a myriad of factors so I don't use those prescription medications that frequently anymore because after I didn't live in Denver after I was consistent with my trigger avoidance after I really implemented a year or more of new skin care practices my rosacea got so much better so I still have a prescription for azelic acid I still use it intermittently especially if I'm traveling to a lot of hot climates or I feel like I'm going to be doing a lot of things that might trigger my rosacea but they're not consistent parts of my routine now because I'm happy with my rosacea just with my lifestyle interventions okay that's not entirely true I'm happy with my rosacea because of my lifestyle interventions and the in-office treatments that I do so let's talk about that fine final puzzle piece of getting my rosacea better which is the treatments I do in my office to improve my redness the thing that bugged me the most about my rosacea aside from that uncomfortable feeling of my skin which got a lot better with trigger avoidance was the redness and the visible dilated blood vessels on my cheeks and nose and chin and those red blood vessels are structural changes in the skin and there is no skin care in the world that's going to make those go away the only way you can make those go away is to actually destroy those little blood vessels and I do that with a laser in my practice I have something called a v-beam laser that is a brand name of a pulsed Dye Laser so pulse Dye Laser is the type of laser that it is and it is meant to Target hemoglobin in the skin hemoglobin is the protein that is inside your red blood cells and it's what gives your blood that red color and so that laser is specifically designed to Target that redness and eliminate it or reduce it so I have a v-beam treatment done twice a year maybe three times a year when I was initially getting my redness under control I had a lot more blood vessels on my face because I I did my rosacea pretty much ever and I'd been accumulating them over a lifetime so when I initially started treating myself with the vbeam I did three back-to-back treatments like once a month for three months and then I went into maintenance mode which is a couple of treatments a year now there are other lasers or devices out there that can Target redness in the skin for example IPL BBL XLV laser we just happen to use a v-beam laser in our practice I think it's the gold standard I feel very comfortable using it so a lot of times people ask me well what's the best device for treating rosacea or treating red blood vessels or addressing redness in the skin and it's not so much about the device it's about the person operating the device what are they comfortable using what kind of results do they get with that technology even though I have maintenance sessions a couple times a year that's probably because I'm a little more nitpicky than the average patient a lot of my patients will do sort of their initial rosacea blood vessel treatments three or four treatments back to back and then maybe once a year or every couple of years they'll have a single treatment to help them maintain their results the thing about rosacea is that if you treat it with a laser it doesn't reduce your tendency to make blood vessels so it's not that your blood vessels that you treated are coming back but you're going to continue to make new blood vessels over a lifetime and if you have rosacea those blood vessels might be more prominent or more reactive and more bothersome and you may want to continue maintenance treatments so that you can continue to address them unfortunately this is not something that's covered by insurance this is considered an aesthetic or a cosmetic treatment and so unfortunately that means that it's not going to be financially available to everyone but I wanted to be really honest about what I do and not pretend that it's all skin care and Trigger avoidance and prescription medication I need a machine to make me the most satisfied with my rosacea and I think it's important to be forthcoming about that so that is how I got my rosacea under control and how I keep it under control now that doesn't mean that I don't get flares from time to time I certainly do and I still hate them and I still think they're super annoying but they are less intense and less frequent than they used to be and that's the reality of living with a chronic health condition a chronic skin condition is that you might have really good control but there still might be triggers or flares that come up from time to time and it's all about lessening the intensity of those lessening the frequency of those and having them be part of your life but not take over your life do you deal with rosacea share any tips or products that have helped you in the comments I'm sure it will help other people as

        "transcript": "as an Interventional dry eye specialist who has incorporated low-level light therapies into my Optometry practice by adding an esthetician I'm an advocate for advanced therapies as I have seen them help so many patients but I always want the patient whether you're my patient or not to understand all aspects of not only their medical issue but the available treatments so today in that spirit I wanted to impart a little education about something that's not super common in Eye Care this isn't really an eye doctor's area necessarily but this is pity rosacea and the information available stating that uva-1 phototherapy has demonstrated high levels of efficacy and tolerability for treating a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic skin diseases like pity rosacea so there's actually four types of rosacea Iris themedotel injectatic rosacea is the first that's the kind that has lots of little blood vessels on the face papulopuscular or acne related rosacea where you'll have like actual pustules five minutes rosacea that shows big changes in the nose and then ocular rosacea and today we're going to discuss Pityriasis rosacea which can be mistaken for skin conditions like tinea which is a fungal skin infection also known as ringworm or psoriasis so careful diagnosis is needed there's also other less common illnesses like syphilis that can cause a similar rash and so today we're going to get into treatments and Pityriasis rosacea and how it's different from those facial rosaceas that can cause ocular rosacea foreign so welcome back to ischool with me Dr D where I teach you about products and treatments related to dry eye syndrome and eye Beauty so that you can have healthy beautiful comfortable eyes and before you go give a little tap on the Subscribe button to stay up to date with all the latest eye tips and tricks I have for you so Pityriasis rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that causes a temporary rash of raised red scaly patches on the body and it can affect anyone but it's more common in older children and young adults so ages 10 to 35. it's actually a skin rash that sometimes begins as a large spot on the chest the belly or the back followed by a pattern of smaller lesions the cause of Pityriasis rosacea isn't well understood but it may be triggered by a viral infection it's currently thought that perhaps P rosacea is caused by a viral infection and it's thought that this virus is one of the herpes viruses so children and young adults are more susceptible for unknown reasons but recurrences are actually Fearless rare a person who develops this type of skin rash has only a two percent chance of experiencing it again the condition causes widespread minimally itchy skin rash on the trunk and upper legs and upper arms it does usually go away on its own but steroid creams antihistamines and in rare cases antiviral drugs can help now Pityriasis rosacea is not considered an STD and though it is recently thought to be identified as a herpes virus that doesn't make it an STD it's also not known to be due to any type of allergic reaction and it's not a sign of any type of internal disease so it kind of happens in isolation so since it's neither contagious nor sexually transmitted there's no reason to avoid close or intimate contact when somebody has this on their skin the exact cause is unknown there's no germ bacteria virus or fungus that's been found in people with the rash however certain types of herpes viruses can be part of the cause it's also not associated with allergies Foods medicine or stress that we know of in one uncommon type of P rosacea the rash can be concentrated on the armpits and groin or on the face forearms and Shins It's usually going to begin as a single patch of that pink to Red scaly skin that's called a Herald patch and that's normally on the trunk neck or upper arms but this type of rosacea is not the type that commonly causes ocular rosacea which I made a video about here kitty rosacea continues for about 10 to 14 days and the rash gradually spreads out when you see new spots or bumps on your skin once the rash stops spreading it lasts for a few days to a few months this is considered a mild but common skin condition it's characterized by these scaly pink inflamed skin and it can last from one to three months and usually leaves no lasting marks behind it can be treated with corticosteroid creams or ointments you can put this medicine on that rash two to three times a day for up to three weeks some people will use calamine lotion a pink watery lotion that can help stop itching or even antihistamines so phototherapy is specifically uva-1 phototherapy has recently demonstrated high levels of efficacy and tolerability for treating a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic skin diseases so phototherapy can take the form of exposing the skin to sunlight or to an UltraViolet bee light either one can help alleviate the symptoms of Pityriasis rosacea it reduces itching and heals that rash faster the ultraviolet B light or UVB exposure is done at a doctor's office not an optometrist I would recommend a dermatologist and if you wanted to try to use natural sunlight you should consult your doctor first both types of phototherapy can cause the spots of the rash to darken and remain visible after the rash is gone so given the commonality mildness and such a low recurrence rate for p rosacea and with so many available treatments in this particular situation for this specific condition it does not appear that UV A1 phototherapy is really first line due to the fact that it can alleviate the symptoms by reducing itching and healing but it can also increase the amount of spots that remain after the rash is gone which is something that doesn't happen if you use a cortical serum cream or ointment calamine lotion or something like that and finally although this disease shares the name rosacea it's really not the same as the types of rosacea that predominantly affect the face and cause ocular rosacea which in turn causes dry eye syndrome my bromine gland dysfunction and all of these things I treat in my clinic so ultimately if you feel that you have a rash that looks like pity rosacea I would absolutely recommend seeing your dermatologist or your primary care who can get you into your dermatologist for appropriate diagnosis and treatment if you've made it this far and you're not already subscribed to my Channel please hit the button and Bell so you don't miss notifications that's it for today's ischool class is dismissed

        "transcript": "There's no way to know for sure whether you're going to get rosacea, but there is no way to necessarily prevent it. Rosacea tends to be an inflammatory type of skin disorder, but there are several different types of rosacea. There is the papulopustular type, which tends to be on the cheeks, nose, chin and forehead. There is also the type where you get telangievtatic, or blood vessels that cause reddening of the skin. There is another form called rhinophyma where you get thickening of the skin. It tends to happen in one particular area, the nose or the chin. There's also a form called ocular rosacea where there's redness and blood vessels along the margins of the\neyelid. You can also get some tearing associated with that and some sensitivity to light. There are many treatments for rosacea. Papuls and pustuls are best treated with a topical medication. If the topical medications don't work, sometimes we go to an oral medication. For the ocular form of rosacea, generally the oral medication is the best. That tends to be more of an inflammatory component of rosacea, and it takes the oral medication to really get that under control. The rhyinophyma form generally is more of a surgical treatment. There are also some lasers that can help with that. There are certain factors that will aggravate rosacea, things like exposure to sun, alcohol, hot liquids, spicy foods and stress. These types of things do tend to flare most people. There can be overlap between rosacea and acne, and it can be difficult to tell the two apart. We cannot cure rosacea. It is not something that we can completely get rid of, but it's something that we can control. It's a matter of finding the right combination of treatments for your particular subtype of rosacea.",

        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "hi Rosie friends its Julie and today I'm gonna do something a little bit different than what I normally do in my videos I'm not gonna be talking about types of treatments and products I've tried and things like that today I'm going to be responding to something that I feel is very important because so many of you have reached out to me and have told me about the things that you've been going through and I think that there is one point that I've heard over and over again that I just really would like to help with and that's the fact that the people in your lives your friends and family just don't understand what you're going through and so I'm not gonna make a video about what rosacea is because we have it we know what it is and there are some great places where you can learn about that and I'll put that in the description below but I think what there isn't enough of is what rosacea actually feels like because it's not fun at all and that's really an understatement so for this video I haven't done my normal lighting I haven't made any effort to make myself look any better I'm trying to show exactly what rosacea feels like I'm one of the lucky ones I actually have my condition mostly under control it takes a lot of work sticking to a very very tight schedule of skin care and treatments and things like that and I still get flare-ups but mostly it's under control and yet still when I wash my face it still comes out like this for about an hour every single day and this is what it looks like you can see the redness there are even little pimples that come up and they go away within the hour but this is what it looks like when it's under control for me and I've even been told that this is about as good as it's gonna get in my lifetime I think it's very important to point out that I don't have a sunburn I'm not an alcoholic and I don't have acne those are all very serious conditions but they're not what I have and they are not treated in the same way and still if I walk into a drugstore and I'm looking at makeups I have people who say Oh somebody's been spending too much time in the Sun or I can recommend a different acne treatment for you to help you with those pimples and that's very very hard to deal with over and over again if it happens once or twice it's one thing but basically every time I go into a skincare section that's what I hear and it's very hard on me and I'm not alone in feeling that way research published by the National rosacea Society has shown that ninety percent of people who have rosacea also have struggles with their own self-confidence and self-image as a result of it it's not just a little bit of redness and it's not just a little bit of discomfort when I have a flare-up my skin isn't just a little bit pink it turns beet red it's very dark it also becomes very inflamed and swollen it actually puffs out a little bit so my face actually gets rounder as a result of it as I showed you a few moments ago my skin also breaks out in tiny the little bumps they're called papules they look like whiteheads they're not pimples at all in fact they can come and go for me within the span of an hour my skin actually gets very hot and to the touch it feels very warm but on the inside it feels burning hot it feels as though I'm sitting too close to an actual fire it also starts to sting it feels as though somebody has been missing my face with acid and it can be very painful or it can be very itchy or it can be Bowl when my face becomes too inflamed because it's also very sensitive skin I can also break out in hives which are like wheels that are that are very similar to an allergic reaction and they're very uncomfortable too and that reaction that kind of flare-up can last anywhere from a few hours to days or weeks and as I've already said that's with my skin condition under control I'm actually one of the lucky ones out of four subtypes of rosacea I only have two there are two others which are ones that can affect the eyes ocular rosacea and there's another one that actually causes the skin to thicken on the nose to the point that it actually grows out and becomes deformed there are a lot of studies that are underway to try to find the cause and a cure for rosacea but neither of those things are actually known right now a lot of companies out there pretend that they have a cure they try to market to say once you use this you'll never have a flare up again none of those things are true I really recommend that you speak to a dermatologist before you try any products no matter how big the promises happen to be or what kind of research they state because there is nothing known that will cure rosacea it just doesn't exist so we just have to keep going through this and trying very hard to keep up skin the right skincare for the time of year and for the reactions of our skin we have to keep learning about what we should be eating we need to stay out of the Sun and we need the support of those around us it's very difficult at times we feel very very ugly and it just gets worse and worse over time so all you need to do to support somebody who has rosacea is to get that they are feeling a lot of discomfort at the moment that they can't necessarily spend as much time in direct sunlight as everybody else and that they might have to turn down that glass of red wine even if they really want it it's not that we're trying to be sticks in the mud it's that if it makes it worse we'll be even more uncomfortable and we don't know how long the flare-up will last so I'm not using this video to complain about what rosacea is I've had it for over 15 years now and as I said like I'm one of the lucky ones so I really don't have the right to complain but what I am trying to do is Express what it feels like on the inside having this condition because it there are times when you can forget about it but there are times when it can be very painful and very difficult so a little bit of understanding goes a long way and I hope that this video will help to spread that and a little bit of kindness and a little bit of patience before you make assumptions about people and the skincare they've been trying and what they've been doing to try and help themselves they're not necessarily overreacting and it doesn't mean that they've been making the wrong choices so if you did find this video informative or if you did find it interesting or if you think it would be helpful I hope that you'll share it with somebody else you know because the odds are they know somebody else with the rosacea and they might be saying things or doing things with the best intentions but that are only making things worse for that person I also hope you'll take a moment to share your own stories your own experiences in the comments below because it can go a long way to find out that you're not the only person who's been going through this I've joined forums and that's exactly why I've started making these videos and I keep my blog I keep up with everybody on social media and that's why I do this is because it actually helps me as much as everybody said it's been helping them too it's really important to know that you're not alone so as I said if you want to learn more about the condition about the latest research and about the things that are being recommended to help to care for it and treat it and things like that there are some great resources in the description below none of them are trying to sell any things they're all dermatological associations and things reputable organizations like that so I hope this helps and I'll be returning to my regular videos on Sunday and I guess that's everything for now and I'll see you next time",

        "transcript": "probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea the first one is actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big overview of rosacea what it is all the different types Medical Treatments that I recommend and then also a full AM and PM skincare routine please let me know if you have any questions let me know what you think of this video below please please don't forget to like And subscribe I do have a lot of stuff coming out for you soon and I'm always taking topic recommendations so if you want me to address

        "transcript": "welcome I'd like to first of all thank everyone who had a very busy day I'm sure today for joining us this is absolutely the most excited I've been to do a webinar or speak on any topic literally in the last decade I'm gonna be talking about the redesigned V beam prima and redesigned is about the most underwhelming way I think to speak about this fantastic new device but it is entirely redesigned and it's just it's got some tremendous features and I feel very lucky to have been the first one to use this just to give you some background about me I'm a board-certified dermatologist however I have been doing laser surgery almost exclusively using lasers and energy based devices for most of my career here and I'm embarrassed a loan that's been but it's been a very long time and so this is my passion and I could not be more excited or grateful to be the one speaking today and I've been working with Candela since Wow since the early 90s believe it or not and so I've gotten to see these lasers evolve and change over time so the redesigned technology it's a pulsed dye laser but it's it's absolutely the most used laser in my practice and by me and I do in my office actually all the treatments with this laser because I love it Candela created the first fda-cleared pulsed dye laser post eye laser is key because the wavelength of light that comes out of the post that laser 595 nanometers is not easy to get yet from any other way so you know when we use lasers we're limited by the physics and by at physics and then the ultimate biology of that physics you know we're limited to what wavelengths we can get easily and 595 nanometers used to be very challenging to get because it's it's produced from a dye and these lasers are beginning more sophisticated more advanced and more reliable over time and this is the culmination of all that research you know it's been 12 years as you'll see in a little bit since we've had a new PDL so a larger maximum treatment size 15 millimeter treatment beam is huge what does that mean it means faster treatments but it also changes the nature of the biology meaning I believe I see a more uniform result and I see better clinical results in my experience longer laser die life I actually tested a prototype of this laser in very very busy office use and I'll talk about that a little bit how much longer is the die life or how much longer was it in my experience once daily calibration this is great so currently I have to calibrate the laser every time I change the energy the fluence or change the spot size that's going to be just calibrate once the beginning of the day and you're off to the races it saves a lot of time there's gonna be the option of contact cooling so it's really nice to have that option there's a zoom handpiece which means you can very quickly and easily change from different spot sizes today you have to change a slider which it's pretty quick but it certainly have to calibrate each time it's not as convenient and the Diagnostics is key they can diagnose the laser remotely you know if it's having an issue although how the reliability in my hands has been dramatically improved that's a big deal and the user interface is cool it's a computer interface so it's going to be a lot just a lot more user friendly although it's pretty user friendly now but any improvements always welcome well if you think of PI R squared the area the area of a 15mm spot is a hundred and twenty-five percent larger than the spot I currently use the most which is a ten millimeter and it's over 50 percent 56 percent larger than a twelve millimeter diameter beam that's a big difference which means much more even treatments but I also think it means you know greater even penetration of the laser energy of depth and so that's a much bigger deal than it seems like than just oh you know we can now treat you know 56% fast or 125 you know double you know double is fast half the treatment time I think it means more than that but it certainly means much faster treatment times I mean it's incredible and again I've had the pleasure of using this laser and a couple clinical trials one of which I'll be talking about today you know one treating the face one treating the neck and just the speed is incredible I mean it's it's it's awesome and again you know you'll try the laser for yourself my enthusiasm aside you know I always tell people you know use it for yourself don't listen to me and I'm not invested again in people following my advice you know try and see what you think so again you know showing 12 versus 15 millimeter what the area is one point and and and the other key point is the maximum fluence so there's 50% more energy available from this device so for example with a 12 millimeter beam diameter with the old VB imperfecta you can deliver seven joules per square centimeter but with the v being prima you can give 9.75 joules per centimeter squared which is quite a difference and for a 15 millimeter spot size didn't even exist with the v beam perfecter the max was 12 and here you can give 6.75 joules per centimeter squared which is a clinical meaningful fluence with that spot-size and so that's a big deal but when you have 50% you know more energy available and no one not only allows you to give bigger being diameters with the laser you're using but it allows you to give higher flow once is with the splat size as you're used to using dye life management first of all it's more efficient and what that means is the entire laser head the place where the energy comes from which is really cool if you've you know I don't know how many people have had an opportunity to see one of these disassembled but it's a completely redesigned laser which means it's much more efficient dye consumption is more efficient this is a major departure from the previous technologies not just like you know we're tweaking something here and there this is a big change and and that's the reason we have a bigger beam diameter available and better dye life so using similar plant parameters which I had so I had a laser that basically had the same energies and parameters available as the current of eating perfecta but with the newly designed head it lasted much much longer and we can discuss how longer in my hands during the question and answer period at the end the software keeps track of tire life which is pretty cool so instead of waiting for the laser to eventually slow down you know as we've done in the past the laser will know when the dye life is nearing its end and can be changed before you notice any change in function experience PDL leadership what does that mean well the pulsed dye laser was really the first Dermalogica laser that was put into use back in 1983 and the SPT l1 which was 577 nanometers that was released in 1988 the Candela SPT l1 a I believe it had a five millimeter beam diameter repetition rate may have been one pulse per second or may have been one pulse every three seconds then came the SPT l-1b which is a pretty big advance 585 nanometers much faster rep rate bigger beam diameters that was a pretty darn good laser and I loved it then came the tunable sclera plus I was one of the first to use that and and the SPT l1 be one of the first the sclera plus I may have been the first and that was tunable and we quickly found a 595 nanometers was the optimal wavelength for linear vessels rosacea diffused redness and actually worked well also for port wine stains then came the V beam classic and then the VB imperfecta which was a very big leap in technology and the reason is it had eight sub pulses meaning the long pulse durations for treating linear vessels without bruising without purpura the the V beam classic tried in my opinion to do that at but it didn't do well I think we often got purpura because there were a few four sub pulses and so you really didn't see purpura free removal of most vessels like we did with the VB imperfecta so laser we use now i can remove linear vessels on the face and legs without purpura very rapid rep rate but I I'm limited to a 12 millimeter beam diameter and and not such high fluencies with the 12 millimeter and we have dim limit I have a limited die life if I choose to use the laser at maximum fluence and so although the VB imperfecta it's it's today gotta be the most used laser in my office to me the VB imperfective state-of-the-art but the things I'd like to improve have all been addressed with the V being Prima so I'm pretty excited about that five ninety five to me is the ideal wavelength for treating vessels for sure but it's also the number one on rejuvenating laser in my practice you can see the oxyhemoglobin curve and the melanin curve and what's keys you want to be you know at a hemoglobin absorption that's above where there's not an absorption because we're not aiming at the pigment that skin necessarily we're aiming at the hemoglobin when we're treating vascular things the reason I like 595 nanometers you know as you go longer wavelength is less Mountain absorption but there's a lot of hemoglobin absorption and to me that's the ideal scenario for a pulsed dye laser why aren't there more pulsed dye lasers on the market because they're hard to build technology is not easy but candelas been doing it since I started since before I started in lasers and and they know how to do it now and make it extremely reliable what can you treat tons of stuff you can treat vascular things you know man geo men's angiomas spider Angie you know miss cherry angiomas pour wine stain birthmarks facial redness rosacea leg veins POC poor clitoris Avadh I just completed a study treating that with the new vegan Prima pigmentation you can certainly treat pigmentation with it and then clearly wrinkles there's a good literature and I believe I want a paper showing that helps treat wrinkles so just showing some of the history rosacea it's absolutely the treatment choice for treating rosacea I did a paper wanna also another my derma logic heroes without were Kligman treating rosacea with the VB imperfecta I've also recently completed a study we've submitted for publication using the V beam prima for treating rosacea it's a hundred percent in my opinion the treatment in choice for treating for winding birthmarks and there's an enormous enormous literature doing so for treating red scars again in my opinion treatment of choice 100% treating angiomas all day long very easy treatment of choice for inflammatory acne i can tell you i treated my kids with it as part of their regimen so rosacea clinical results i said i completed a study with this the v being prima the new device we did I did four treatments I used an elliptical 3 by 10 millimeter spot cryogen cooling to treat the linear' vessels then treated the whole face with the superfast 15 millimeter new beam diameter we we were it was open enrollment to any skin type we had 17 subjects were seen for treatments to received 3 treatments just based on their follow-up did a globalisation assessment and then blinded evaluation of digital images taken with the Canfield system which again you know sort of like Candela Canfield systems of gold standard in my opinion for medical photography we use the Vizia CR which i think is the it's the research version of their photographic software treatments were tolerated well can be annoying I don't use numbing cream typically pain score was five point six Anna ten on average these are the fluence ha's we used I use I treat all the patients I started the first treatment everyone's treated the same fluence and then gradually increased as we went up there was a slight range although it was pretty narrow the number of pulses went down probably because I was treating treating patients with most certainly less medium pulses went down definitely with the 3 by 10 because people had less linear vessels with each treatment some of them disappeared so I had less less vessels to treat with the circular spot the number of pulses was around the same because I'm trying to treat the whole face so I did not really decrease the number of pulses because I'm covering the whole face but with the 3 by 10 I use the same fluid it's each time and I treated with less pulse as time went on because there were less vessels one would hope and that's actually a good indication there are less vessels because I'm obviously not counting the pulses I'm just treating so my global assessment I'm a biased observer but so I don't put a whole lot of faith in these but it was done as part of the study so we included we used a six-point scale 0 is clear 6 is severe and I looked at the two-month follow-up and of course you know there was improvement but big deal let's look at the blinded photography and when we look at the this is a global assessment so rosacea symptoms we looked at a global and then inflammatory lesions erythema inject Asia rated 1 is 0 to 6 scale and obviously at follow-up we saw a big increase global improvement from 4.3 to 1.8 all these improvements to significant flam Ettore lesions 1.7 to 1 or a theme of 4.5 to 1.6 and twinject ages 4.2 to 1.1 moving forward blinded evaluation so this is blinded evaluation of digital images this is the part that I like as a scientist and the most and blinded evaluators correctly identified the baseline image the two-month follow-up period in 96.5% 55 out of 57 images which is fantastic for a blinded study you know why wouldn't it be a hundred percent because rosacea waxes and wanes so in some of the inn's you know sometimes people can have a flair even though their baseline rosacea can be whatever it is you know maybe they're flared post-treatment but not pretreatment or whatever and that's 96 455 out of 57 images is darn good improvement scores averaged fifty three point nine percent plus or minus two point six percent which obviously I'm very pleased with 16 out of 19 subjects approximately 84% had improvement greater than forty percent and more than half of subjects improved more than fifty percent again you know the way I describe rosacea of my patients and waxes and wanes like the stock market right you have a trend that's either up or down but any given day can be you know more up or more down but you got to look at trends with rosacea and so I explained that to all my patients and I explained it to investigators and doctors right subject and investigators satisfaction well subject satisfaction I guess matters a lot but again we're still biased observers 18 out of 19 subjects were very satisfied what was somewhat satisfied that's good to know that means everyone was satisfied I'd write an investigator which was me was very satisfied to 18 out of 19 subjects I wonder if I was the same one that was somewhat satisfied and the investigator rated subjects global improvement seventy one point six percent you know it's interesting to is it's it's easier to rate people even if you do blinded ratings although I don't know you would do that because if you're doing two time points the blind the Raider is going to know the later time point is after treatment but looking at actual patients real time is even better indicator than the best photography in my opinion side effects side effects are pretty minimal people can get a Deema usually it's pretty mild you know I get treated and usually get treated in the middle of my treatment day but it's very you know patients have a lot of rosacea they can get a lot of edema purpura ranges from zero to you can induce purpura depending on the settings you use and it really is it's a function of setting the the more modern lasers the the VB perfect envy being prima you can really treat people without any bruising without Perot or you can choose to treat them with purpura you know depending on the individual patient what you trying to accomplish with the older generation way older more than twelve years ago and beyond lasers the earlier ones there was always purpura and it's pretty severe and it can be pretty limiting because it can let you know in the old days it lasted seven you know one to two weeks now you know you don't really see that unless unless you adjust the laser because you want to see it you know and then there's reasons for that that are complicated sometimes I do that so I'll just go through some some clinical samples of patients I treated these are pretty typical examples you can see before on the left after on the right another patient various angles this person had three treatments I see great results so you know study overview I was very pleased with the results of this study how many people have rosacea I mean in my opinion is my personal opinion pretty much any light person will develop to inject asia's extra blood vessels they'll tell you they're broken blood vessels they're not broken they're extra they don't belong there and once they come they flush and blush more than the native vessels we all have because they're abnormal what makes them flush and blush anything fun right Eck well exercise alcohol chocolate coffee hot cold basically life I always thought it was funny where you know my doctor told me to avoid ancient triggers good luck with that all right don't go in the hot cold have coffee drink alcohol exercise I mean you know give me a break so sixteen million people are estimated to have rosacea in the u.s. you know any skin type of person can get rosacea so it's you know like skin people are more susceptible because the sun is a critical cause of rosacea in my opinion in a hundred percent of cases but that combines with people's genetics as to who's more susceptible to developing rosacea so when you combine sunlight with genetics you know you have millions of people that are susceptible to getting rosacea in my opinion any person skin types 1 2 3 given enough Sun will develop facial redness and flushing whether they get the pimple strip or I am and over going oil glands or not remains to be seen but in my opinion I call that rosacea if there's flushing and blushing and I personally believe anyone with light skin is susceptible 6 and 10 people that adverse Asia consider to be extremely or very bothersome 710 people united states who have rosacea have been suffering for three years or longer but when also I found interesting about this market research seventy-four percent of patients are not satisfied with their treatment no kidding because I don't believe any treatment addresses the root cause the vessels themselves except for laser prescription creams gels and cosmetics I mean creams and gels 62 percent over-the-counter 49 so half of people homeopathic 32% that's interesting actually oral antibiotics 20% and laser therapy only 8% so clearly we need to do a better job of educating patients so now I'm done I'm ready for questions and I hopefully can supply answers I'm also prepared to ask you the audience questions and and have you supply me with some of your answers because geez you know I can always learn more so I want to thank you for coming today if you have to run thank you for being here but if you stopped stick around as long as anyone wants to to answer questions and to ask questions thank you communication by web I know I am yeah I'm kind of a lazy nerd this is far away I'm most excited or laser project but I also had my telescope out last night trying to look at Mars and then how many other components oh we're doing that so getting some questions in here and I've spent a lot of time with this laser so I can answer a lot of questions about it um there's an easy one how big a difference is in one's daily calibration make for me right now you have the Primo but I also have the effector and bunch of them and it's far away my most used laser and you have to calibrate before every time to change affluence every time to change the spot size and it's time sent and it you know I guess is between one or two people all day it doesn't make much difference but for me believe it or not that actually makes a big difference so it's just incredibly time-saving throughout my day and if you do as much lasers I do take huh and I shall enjoy that silly might sound like a minor feature but it's not I'd see we're getting questions here I'm gonna jump into what we got arm is the present place you're going to be on the web the presentation is going to be on the web absolutely they're going to post this later you can re-watch it you can also hear my answers to the questions but in addition to that you'll be able to look you can look actually inhalation surgery medicine it's one of the questions how do I treat rosacea patient with a good game so the study I did with the with the Prima is published and you can get it lasers and surgery medicine also studies have done with the old perfect a lot of people asking questions about the perfect laser and I also published some papers on that and unfortunately there's not really a cookie cutter answer that everyone wants how do you treat a relationship patient everybody's different and so it really comes with experience what kind of settings you want to use the nice thing about pulse eyelids are like the perfection of crema compared to for example in IPL you know the IPL is builder head device to use and it's incredibly challenging and difficult device to use in my opinion it's a jack of all trades master of none because it's not one wavelength multiple wavelengths and there's variability much more variability you know from day to day as their flash land pages etc etc with different filters whereas with the post our laser it's a fixed wavelength right when you pick you pick your spots wise based on what you're treating but that's not really a big deal let me just pick the pulsation or Florence so and the fact that you know you know exactly what you're treating with and you have to look at the tissue response you know what is no everyone's Asia patients different so you know but but I think compared to any other device use it to me it's the uses to place using the most used device in my office arm see there is a 1064 like a pick away so one of the best treatments for treating deceased redness and this person practice is 1064 I would choose to hear how you do that because I don't really like 1064 switch reading if you spread I only use 595 and I prefer using longer shorter pulse tenacious retinas I do not like using 1064 to treat that that's either linear what if you threaten us because we give me little insertions pretty clear there in my opinion so I guess my answer to that the 26 before least in my hands he's for vascular I've used your larger blue spider veins on the legs but most of the people that I know that have been wavelength lasers if you really look at the laser 90 plus 95 or more percent of the pulses are going to be with benign 1064 wavelength for example that's fine 32 in 1064 doping with 532 I prefer 595 and I expect at least in my office bass enjoy the pulses in my laser probably 595 when I'm treating larger glue vessels and the legs that's when of using content except for another question I got I've spoken a lot about rosacea one of my experience then with the Prima and treatment of other indication well first of all a bigger beam diameter and faster rep rate of the Prima is going to allow I think people to treat conditions that normally be too expensive right why allow expensive use up a lot of dye and it's time-consuming so for example if you're treating your full face with Profeta it's still pretty fast but you're using a fly it takes time you know with the new Prima gonna be even faster so I think I've always said that you know I use in some acne patients that have red acne papules and red acne marks I have used the perfect laser I think in the future the Prima is going to be used a lot more as a fourth line treatment meaning after only mnemonics topical antibiotics peels because I think with the faster treatment time the bigger spot size and left eye you don't think it should be a whole lot cheaper to treat people and so normally say oh it's too expensive you know they have like these IPL devices that people use the triage I think you know the prima is certainly going to be faster I believe way more effective at you know staving off or temporarily adding to knocking down at me I treat me the Sylvania spider angiomas cherry angiomas I treat spider little things on the lights yes the perfecter now using the Prima hopefully it looks like we have a lot more longer delights I had a perfect the laser with the Prima head in for two years and using the perfected parameters with a premium head I got tremendously longer down life now we have to wait and see with the Prima parameters and the Prima box is it two different products how long the doll age is going to be because we don't know yet but I can tell you in a prototype laser that was a perfected with the Prima head it was tremendously longer then I got with a Perfector and there's a guy always indicating it tells you you know how the guys doing when it's time to change the dye care so you don't have to worry about being down you know if all of a sudden the guy needs to be changed so that's not going to happen when the engineers and I do a lot with the engineers and they're my favorite people to talk to at candela any device company the engineers don't really tell you what's going on and they've really got a beautiful job but this weighs I mean it's a good to me it's a bigger thing it's got the capability to deliver 50 percent more energy that means high effluences with the stock sizes I commonly use like 12 millimeters 10 millimeters and the ability to deliver clinically relevant fluencies meaning you know you got a 15 and by the low it's going to do hankies you got 15 14 and a half 14 etcetera so you can you know deliver fluencies that that work with these big stock sides not just a big spot size you can use so you know that's another aspect of this plays and it's really been a big deal and I personally believe that I'm seeing and this is my my opinion now because I haven't done a side-by-side I could I believe I'm seeing better results from the bigger spot I think it's more even so you're gonna see like sprinting with a big 1500 meter seems more even across the old beam to me and I think I'm seeing better clinical response the two studies I did did a prospectus 30 years ago treating rosacea right decade and then I did this prima study we just published these different scales but we tried to compare them and it looks like this study the Prima did a better job but they'll really prove that you have to do side by side another question what features benefit from prima versus previous generation full sky coming stuff we talked about so the longer certainly the potential longer dilates in a new box is a big deal that the 15 millimeter start which results from being able to deliver up to 50 percent more energy total energy from the laser is probably the biggest thing today um that that because the boy energy lies you have bigger spot but the longer da life potentially and believe America once the calibration I love these would be a cooling having the option for contact cooling is pretty cool I think it'll be interesting for leg veins when you're using longer pulse durations I need to study that more because that you knew the pulse train is a little bit different on the Prima and I think that may be one of the reasons I Eve I'm seeing a different and better clinical response and I'm gonna have to spend more time and are going back and forth to really figure out if if there's a major difference yeah trying to look at some more questions here and fall into a acne what are the advantages of incorporating Vivi the acne treatment plan of water its limits well I was kind of talking about that before when I lecture about acting and I really feel like both sides or somebody because the cost in the past has been what I call a full fine treatment for example on treating my own family I'll do oral antibiotics topical you know topicals first oil animatics I only do ladies Dippet I send them to a colleague for treatment I like once monthly aging peels not with coma downs and then you know you got those home blue lights like Katrina blue light people can use at home but then you know I treat my family my kids whatever you're gonna love that I'm talking about this week's gonna be recorded and insane each one with the pulsed dye laser because I believe it it I would say it extended time at least in in my personal belief in personal experience because I'm you know I don't know what the FDA says about that but when I say about it is that she's my kids with it I think it not only helps rapidly improve there's sort of healing packing papules but I also think it has an effect at suppressing acne and that's something I'd like to study going forward I've talked to the company about that I'm very interested max about looking at that going forward so because we need real data but in clinical practice and certainly with my own family I use with the parties give a series of treatments that maybe four-day weekend events and then take a break no message for caused inconvenience come so I think we need to learn a lot more about that that's a cool question and I think the new laser the new Prima will give the option so we're getting close to the end of our time what I use the same settings perfect and prima or do I have to change given that it's stronger so like if you use the same in diameter same spot size are you can use exactly the same things that you use I see you asked this questions is it brilliant you can use the same settings because it's based you're gonna have the same affection to be virtually the same again there's a little bit of a difference with the way the pulse train is comprised but even using bigger spots right 13 14 15 millimeters and when you do that often will drop the phone's a little bit to get the same effect so you'll have to kind of play with the laser and see what I predict and what I've seen in using both is with the same parameters you can pretty much keep the same settings there may be a couple differences I'm not sure yet with your mythical Scott still looking into that well that's a good question I apologize I could answer questions all night I'm getting a signal that column I think it's time to kind of wrap up so ah one last question I'll take I have successfully this is a question of a being perfected for juvenile but I comment",

        "transcript": "if you have ocular rosacea\u00a0\nor even just regular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 this video is for you. Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare

        "transcript": "are you one of the ten percent who's prone to a long blush or even a flush or are you getting spots here that are different to acne type spots or maybe you're someone who's got skin that just looks red all the time and it's super sensitive especially to skin care well you might have rosacea now april is rosacea awareness month so today i wanted to go deep in this common and distressing condition so you have all the information you need to determine if you've got it how to treat it how to choose skin care and what not to do now i'm speaking as somebody who's prone to rosacea myself it kicked in around the age of 30. i suddenly noticed that a glass of red wine my favorite made me redder for longer than all my friends i don't want any photographs taken after a certain time in the evening um i didn't really tend to get spottiness as such and i was definitely sensitive to ill-chosen skin care choices um so i would have to be very careful about what i used on my skin um so if any of that resonates with you then do keep watching because we're going to go into this in a bit more detail but the good news is there's loads that can be done with the right choices of skin care with finding the right treatment to manage your type of rosacea but the key in the first instance is to know what kind of rosacea you have so let's get into that so there are four different types of rosacea now the one that we all know commonly i think is the papulo pustulotype which is often mislabeled as acne rosacea because of the presence of spots red bumps and red bumps with white heads of papules and pustules but there are some key differences to distinguish rosacea from acne the time acne is really a misnomer so the key thing really is that there are no comedones as part of the rosacea process now what can be confusing is that people rosacea can sometimes be also prone to acne but the distribution tends to be different so typically with rosacea we're talking about mid-face disease and the spots themselves have a different quality they're what we call dome shape so the tops are rounded where acne spots tend to be more prone to pointing so that's really key so no comedones and any sort of different shape lesions in a different distribution adult acne is typically in the u of the face teen acne in the t zone so that's type 2 rosacea now type 1 is what we call erythema telangiectatic rosacea so that's a bit of a mouthful but basically it means redness and broken vessels so that's someone who probably doesn't get the spotty aspect but it's just constantly a bit red on the cheeks or the nose and when you peer closely we'll have little broken vessels broken capillaries and they have this pronounced flushing then the third type is phymatus rosacea where basically the ongoing inflammatory process activates fibrosis and thickening of the skin and that's typically seen over the nose something we call rhinophyma now it's rare and it's more common in men but it is an important type to recognize we want to really prevent that type of rosacea and then the final type is ocular rosacea so rosacea's disorder that can affect the eyes and the eyelids so you tend to see reddening and injection along the lid margins and it can occur with conditions like blepharitis as well but someone will typically describe their eyes as being dry gritty um a feeling of discomfort and that's a common manifestation of rosacea it's one that's often missed now one of the hallmarks of rosacea aside from those physical findings is the description of discomfort of the skin so burning and stinging especially in association with skin care and we know that people with rosacea are prone to barrier dysfunction so this is something that practically can really cause problems difficulty using skin care products finding a suitable sunscreen everything burning or stinging when applied to the skin now that is a big and common trigger especially for women but additional triggers exist as well and it really is important to get to know your rosacea and know what your triggers are for some people winter cold weather low humidity will be a real aggravate um we know we've already got barrier dysfunction but that low humidity cold air chafing with winds and things can really make the skin even drier and more sensitive on the other hand there's a group where sunshine and uv is a big part of it and we know that uv is probably a big part in the whole ideology of rosacea it tends to happen in fair-skinned individuals as we said but summer can be particularly troublesome and you factor in sunscreen problems it can often get really quite stressful as i mentioned before what you consume can have a big impact so for me as i said red wine and that's common because red wine not only um is a vasodilator from the point of view of having alcohol in it but it's also histamine releasing which can be a double whammy for redness prone skin but all types of alcohol can make the skin more prone to flushing as can spicy foods hot caffeinated beverages so really be conscious of what you're eating and how that plays into where your skin behaves other things to think about is environmental things so you know i tend not to recommend saunas to my patients we have a disorder that's characterized by broken vessels by vessels opening up in response to the environment and staying open for longer we don't want to promote that by going into a hot environment for long periods of time similarly be conscious of your room temperature where you're working you might well find that a cooler room suits you better it certainly does for me so why does rosacea happen in the first place there's lots of different theories and it's not fully yet understood but the main philosophy that we adopt nowadays is the understanding of the innate inflammatory system in the skin and how it goes wrong and causing rosacea so it's thought to be uv triggered as i mentioned but in those who are genetically predisposed and what the key finding is is the presence of something called catholicidine which is an inflammatory mediator that we're seeing in the skin in response to environmental stressors like sunshine and it's abnormally processed in rosacea and it tends to cause a whole cascade of inflammatory mediators that are released into the skin that attracts something called neutrophils which are a type of white blood cell that really kickstarts the whole process leading to ongoing inflammation that leads to these changes involving the tissues both in terms of the dermis and its structure and the blood vessels so the innate immune system is there to protect us but it's overly sensitive when you have rosacea so i've always likened it to the smoke alarm going off whenever the kettle boils rather than when the oven is on fire so it's misbehaving and the the red alert is going off too soon so when it comes to managing rosacea i think it's very important to look at your approach to your skin holistically so it's not just about what you use in terms of the treatment elements it's about the skin care approach that you adopt too and there are some important steps i think that are worth considering so with rosacea the most important thing is simplicity now i know that simplicity is something i'm i'm an advocate of you know in in all situations really but never more so than in rosacea so i think that we know that biodysfunction is a big part of what goes wrong with the skin so it's really important that what you do does not additionally deplete the skin barrier so the first thing to look at is your cleansing no double cleansing keep it gentle non-foaming i tend to recommend non-clogging as well stick to a single cleanse and use tepid not hot water and when you're patting your skin dye do so very gently it's really important that you do no harm with your cleanse then as part of a barrier repair approach seek out a moisturizer that offers that so not just something with humectants hyaluronic acid really won't do you much good when it comes to rosacea you want nice occlusives you want barrier repair ingredients like ceramides and niacinamide if your skin can tolerate it to help really ensure that barrier stays nice and robust sunscreen with rosacea is really important to give you that uv protection and actually it's amazing how patients really do start to appreciate how important daily sunscreen is all year round with their skin but i find that the best tolerated sunscreens are those that are all minerals so containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to give broad spectrum cover but nice gentle filters that won't tend to irritate skin now moving on to treatments for rosacea so i think it's really important to make sure that that's what you've got in the first instance i mean usually it's pretty straightforward if you've got the symptoms and the signs that i've described but if you're in any doubt do go and see your doctor get referred to a dermatologist to be sure that's what you have and then really you will find that prescription creams do work best when it comes to managing rosacea at least in the first instance i think it's relatively rare particularly with the papillary posterior type you'll get a handle on it with just over-the-counter products so things that might get used in the first instance um antibiotics such as metronidazole and that comes in the form of metro gel or rosex cream i have to say that i've moved away from using this as much in my practice but it's still one of the standard treatments that um that you'll find being used additional treatments might include sulantra or ivamectin which targets the might in the skin demodex possibly due to the effect against demidex mites but possibly just due to an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin as we see with antibiotics it's really not about targeting a bacteria as far as we can see it's about the anti-inflammatory effects that these products have on the skin hence the benefits of azelaic acid which is not targeting a particular organism it's targeting this innate immune system malfunction so those are the three that tend to be used in context of acutely active rosacea now if the skin is particularly active and usually again we're talking about the papillary pasteurity we'll use oral tetracyclines now again we're using them for their anti-inflammatory effect tetracyclines lower the activity of matrix metallic proteinase enzymes in the skin which are part and parcel of what generates this inflammatory amelia with increased catholicism abnormal processing of catalyst in the skin so we can use them at lower doses than we would when we're trying to treat bacterial infections which is good news because any treatment for rosacea is likely to be needed for at least six if not 12 weeks and sometimes beyond that sometimes we need to keep people on long-term therapy it's a disease that's chronic tends to relapse and remit and for some people it just plods on and needs ongoing treatment but you know we're seeing a condition here where we're using drugs that have antibacterial properties but also anti-inflammatory properties and i have to say that the best result tends to be when you combine topicals and normals together there's a synergy that comes into play and i find myself using a lot of cilantro in the acute phase and then i'll often phase azoleic acid in when things are a bit calmer with tetracyclines in the background now in difficult cases we do sometimes use low-dose isotretinoin raccotine or accutane depending on where you are in the world and we also use alpha blocker drugs for somebody who's particularly prone to flushing its causing issues so those are other treatments that we do sometimes use but the mainstay of rosacea treatment are those topicals i mentioned plus or minus tetracyclines which can be used sporadically when needed and i find that for many patients that's a successful toolkit for managing rosacea now when it comes to skin care don'ts i think it's important to be cautious when using anything outside of the list i mentioned before so things i would actively discourage you using because i think they just potentially cause too many problems and offer a little upside so i think double cleansing is a no-no i think pretty much all toners are of little to no benefit and quite likely to cause problems almost all face masks will be problematic very few masks are formulated to redness prone skin i think in a way that's useful in addition to those topicals that we mentioned that are much more important when it comes to regulating your skin physical exfoliants i think for obvious reasons are a no-no chemical sunscreens i would advocate using with caution my experience is that all mineral sunscreens are infinitely more comfortable and easy to use and if you use a tinted one you have the added benefit of a little bit of redness masking and then as far as treatments i really would encourage caution um when it comes to facials and redness really the principles of managing rosacea are about consistent daily use of the right skin care and topicals and i think that the concept of a facial once a month every six weeks really has little benefit to offer and is much more likely to cause flares so i don't think facials are particularly good idea in this instance so in conclusion i'd say that rosacea can be tricky to manage and i definitely think that if you're just starting out on your rosacea journey you think you've got that as a problem with your skin but you're not sure it really is invaluable to go and get some professional guidance on this both in terms of getting it under control with the right topicals um in the short term but also you know a longer term plan you're likely to need a longer term maintenance schedule to keep your skin well controlled but i have to say that with my rosacea patients they're often pleasantly surprised by how easily it we get their skin under control but also how we're then able to evolve their skin care routine into the realms of treating premature aging and i'll get into that in next week's video because i think it's an important topic to cover um but i think don't be despondent i think there are lots of great options now in terms of treating it getting it under control i can speak from first hand that my skin is a lot easier to manage now that i'm on a regimented and simple effective skincare routine so if you have rosacea you know someone who has rosacea please feel free to share this video if you found it helpful um come back next week to dive into rosacea treatment and beyond and i'll see you guys again soon

        "transcript": "hi guys this is a makeup lecture not sure what happened today but I think dr. mousse satu was doing a makeup lecture I'm not sure what happened but let me give you this because we're already going to miss another one in a couple weeks so watch this on youtube this is this will be on the midterm so make sure you study this and the PowerPoint slides for these are posted on brightspace okay so we have rosacea and keratosis pilaris we're going to talk about today rosacea who's that do you guys know who that is that's WC Fields he had stage 4 rosacea and he had the big nose they still think he was a big drinker but he's a very famous comedian well he was a big drinker and they thought the drinking caused the nose but it's not back then they didn't know what rosacea is that's actually called rhinophyma and it's associated with the granulomatous type of rosacea all right so it's a chronic inflammatory disease it only affects the face the lesions are Aerith emic as you can see and there's different phases of them too but we'll go through the four phases but they're erythema --q so they're red and it really really likes the face it's can be seen other places but the face is by far the most common place for it to show up tell Angie act Asia will look at all this facial blushing early on even acne like presentation with papules and even pustules but this not as severe Zack use typically around ten sometimes less than ten of these things it typically starts on the cheeks and then can progress later on to the nose and forehead it doesn't always sometimes it'll stay on the cheeks for lifetime occasionally can develop around the eyes it's called rabbit rosacea or ocular rosacea we'll look at that and it's often misdiagnosed as acne early on it is a chronic disease it's not there all the time especially early on the late phases like granulomatous rosacea is there all the time but the early phases it kind of shows up and then it disappears for a couple months maybe even a couple years then it comes back so it goes into these quiescent periods these quiet periods the more severely and once we have it more severely tend to go through all the stages and it can become quite troublesome in those patients early on it's very commonly misdiagnosed as acne as we said but it has nothing to do with a bacterial infection and as it was thought for many years they used to think alcohol caused it has nothing to do with alcohol directly indirectly alcohol does can cause some hyperemia of the face but it does not cause rosacea I've asked that untestable for alcohol does not cause rosacea here's a more patient with a more advanced form of rosacea because he's starting to affect the nose and it's got a little actually might have some real acne scale scattered in there too but that's that's rosacea as we'll see about 10% of people that's a big number right it's not like my fans point 0.01 percent of the population this is a big one but the the people with very fair skin especially red-haired people tend to be affected more often the ideology is not really known there are some proposed ideologies we come back to the very first lecture I gave you about the DEXA der mites the dust mites that can live in your mattress and they break down into proteins and the proteins can soak in your skin but the in this case the actual mite has been found in some people with rosacea actually living in the in the dermis of the epidermis of the face so some but not all rosacea patients have a large number of these on biopsy there's a nice biopsy of someone's a scraping of their skin on the cheek and there's what we got from this patient those are DEXA termites the mites might cause the following there's but some more theories about these mites how they could produce this condition the mites could act as an antigen and your body sees them down in the dermis and attacks them and that causes a inflammation of the face where they tend to live in the cheeks they could get into the hair follicles and cause an inflammation and blockage of the hair follicles which is called chronic folliculitis remember follicle is that little cave where the where the hair grows out of and so if a blockage occurs then you get real acne you could get acne feeding on the sebum that backs up if the follicle is backed up and yeah so it's like a could be a form of acne or another theory is that these DEXA termites act as bait and bigger viruses love to eat them and so if there's a high population of DEXA termites bacteria and even or viruses and bacteria may invade your face and just live on these things the diagnosis there's no standard diagnostic or histological test now although DEXA termites may show up they don't always show up so really the clinical presentation is a key for making the making this diagnosis this is kind of cool this red-faced spider monkey they they don't have anything this they don't have rosacea but that's kind of funny I never know those things existed typical onset is 30 to 50 years they can affect children too most common and people in the Celtic Ireland region people who blush easy may be at risk for these things affects females more than males however males are more likely to enter the more extreme ended phase the dreaded Rhino FINA rhinophyma face is where the nose gets all crazy and scarred up and full of granulomatous tissue this patient is just it's starting to get rhinophyma in the as you can see a little erythema in it you can see some telangiectasia it's starting to get a little thick here anybody notice anything else about this all right we talked about this condition remember that that yellowing of the skin there so that's xanthelasma pal pre bream that's an indication that a good chance of patient has hypercholesterolemia hyperlipidemia so you definitely want to get this guy's blood work done to see make sure he doesn't have sky high levels of LDL and cholesterol there's a typical more advanced rhinophyma knows that's severe right very disfiguring but that's the end face of rosacea so let's talk about these stages so there's the different classification systems we'll look at one in a second there's also before we get into those there's some subtypes of rosacea there's Lou Boyd rosacea sterilization ocular rosacea rosacea often moves through these four stages especially if it's more severe at the beginning so stage one it's really hard to recognize it really looks like that looks pretty innocent doesn't it it's just like a blushing appearance but most people will blush he'll be gone in a couple hours usually but this one's not this blushing can last for even days before disappearing there's no to be stage one there can be no papules or pustules or any acne like stuff there it's just a redness on the cheeks and it's not a permanent PEC fixture it will go away in a couple days maybe a couple weeks at the most this tends to be set off though there's some triggers sunlight spicy food alcohol especially red wine tends to set this off stress could set it off hot and cold beverages can set it off of the arrhythmia may become or let's go stage two now so so stage one just kind of a erythema of the cheeks now stage two we get the development of telangiectasia if you look closely you can see we've got little blood vessels sprout not peer though that's called telangiectasia that's the key we still have a red background and yep that's stage two there cannot be any pustules or zit like things a parent because that will put us in stage 3 so telangiectasia is the key for stage 2 lots of stars there so make sure you know that there's a close-up over skin and you can see these little it's almost like little varicose veins but varicose arteries so their arteries that are stretched way out and inflamed now stage 3 we can have all of these the erythema and the telangiectasia but the key of stage 3 is papules you get these papules ORS it like things remember papules a raised lesion less than one one centimeter in size and you can see them here they can easily be confused with acne they are they may be on a growth emic background what's that mean air semuc is a red so you may have a red hyperemia type thing a red skin underneath those and they pop up and you can also start getting some a germinal edema at this point so the cheeks and even the chin nose i think looks pretty good but the cheeks have gotten a little bit thick looking because there is some edema from the inflammation here so that is stage 3 okay let's go take a look so here's a stage 3 stage 2 kind of kind of in between I think but there are some papules a and how do we know as it's art or acne is a mixed in with this so that could make the diagnosis difficult he looks like he's at that age but if it's affecting his nose as well so that's probably an early stage 3 there's no question because as adults usually don't have acne so that's definitely late stage 3 we even got some pustules you can see some little white pustules mixed in with this as well stage 4 is called granulomatous rosacea this one thank goodness it doesn't always happen commonly happens more in males so most rosacea patients don't get this far the guys tend to go this way if it's gonna happen but the the papules kind of coalesce or morph together into into big granulomatous lesions so that dermal edema there can be scarring underneath the dermis and it can really permanently thicken what wherever attacks and it absolutely loves the nose that's called FEMA when it fix lots of stars here right so no high-yield slide FEMA is a thickening usually it considered a granulomatous thickening beginning have scar tissue underneath it as well the sebaceous glands become hypertrophic in this they can fill with scar tissue and scar up so that's a fiber it almost always affects the nose so therefore stage four is often associated with rhinophyma so fiema is a thickening rhino means no so a thickening of the nose okay let's take a look at some if I'm at two tests rosacea a rhinophyma and various stages Stage four and you can see you can see telangiectasia the nose as thick the nose is really thick it almost looks like a like kenefick ation and all like a magnifying glasses has blown all the pores up but these are all forms of rhinophyma and a patient with stage four rosacea okay here's another one's really thick cheeks here but the nose right off I'm a big time here another patient with stage four rosacea okay another one severe rhinophyma and a stage four and at this point I mean things can start becoming ischemic and you can start getting pain with these things plastic surgery at this point is the only hope for to kind of try to fix that there are some differential diagnosis is of course acne run-of-the-mill zits acne vulgaris is the word for is it's that's common acne but that that is a poor thing the pores of the skin are clogged usually with with extra oils that are made during adolescence and when they clog bacteria get trapped in those in those pores and they grow the bacteria grow wild and little pustules form and you get whiteheads open and closed comedones you guys probably know that already but right so what's the difference between acne vulgaris and rosacea patients rosacea patients can have pustules even but they can't have those those open and closed comedones the whiteheads and the blackheads if you see whiteheads in black knees blackheads that's acne vulgaris it's not rosacea fungal infections can sometimes look like rosacea infection infectious folliculitis so those pores on your skin the ones that have hairs coming out of those those tunnels that contain the hair shaft those are the follicles so you can get sometimes you can get a staph infection folliculitis and it can look similar to rosacea and patients with lupus erythematosus can also present with kind of a rosacea look but you can do a biopsy and you can tell the difference between that and biopsy let's talk about ocular rosacea so the special types of rosacea often called rabbit eyes a patients typically present with conjunctivitis with this condition and couldn't conjunctivitis is they have red looking eyes or bloodshot eyes and you can see blood vessels kind of sticking out of the whites of their eyes remember the conjunctiva is a film covering the eyes and the inner eyelid these patients have burning and sometimes a dry feeling their eyes can get a little painful with this so here's a patient with rhinophyma started here the nose is getting really thick looks like his currently the a lot of the erythema has been taken out but the nose is still affected because it has granulomatous tissue in it but look at the eyes kind of read and so this is an ocular rosacea patient and will look over here starting to look like he's getting some of the more severe phases of this which we'll look at in a minute so other signs of rabbit eye or ocular rosacea telangiectasias we set all this to have the conjunctive lids around the peri ocular area you can have that recall erythema is caused by hyperemia so there's too much blood capillaries are getting all blown up they can have blepharitis so that's the inflammation of the eyelid usually where those hairs attach into the eyelid you get like a little crust kind of coming out because of the infection Chilly's yawns our cysts that occur from blocked oil glands so here's classic blepharitis right here rosacea patient and notice the hyperemia and even the telangiectasia of this rabbit eye patients organ or ocular conjunct or ocular rosacea patient okay and there's a Chili's iana blocked oil gland now this is not a rosacea patient right this is I couldn't find one in a rosacea patient the people can get these just just normal people can get those this is definitely rosacea patient look how red hyperemia everywhere really got a bad in the eyes severe conjunctivitis so how frequent is ocular involvement occur in rosacea about 58% of rosacea patients will have some degree of ocular abnormalities so it's very common 25% of them may have ocular lesions first before the skin lesions pop up so it could even predate the dermatological or the skin condition on the cheeks so anybody who has any hyperemia like that in the eyes conjunctivitis repeated bouts of it that can't be explained they should have a basic optima logic examination okay what else we got here now sometimes ocular ization patients can kind of there's a serious the finding that it can occur and can lead to blindness and that's a caer tinnitus fear diagnosis because you can go blind from this so it's an inflammation not only of the conjunctiva but it actually gets into the cornea of the eye and scar tissue starts to form and you have trouble seen so it could you could need a cornea transplant for that so severe conjunctivitis telangiectasia look at those blood vessels but you can see the film you can see telangiectasias started to occur right over the over the eye itself so that's not a good thing it's all cloudy now because of the scar tissue in there so that's not a good thing that's care tinnitus called rosacea care tinnitus very serious there's another one those they should care tinnitus again the conjunctival hyperemia telangiectasia is going wild so definitely a rabid eye patient special types of rosacea there's another one that's produced from overusing steroids that's why you have to be careful in sparing that's why that the powerful steroids are not corticosteroids like the creams are not over-the-counter you have to go easy on those things you can end up giving yourself a rosacea so it's long term use of cortical steroids for other types of dermatological conditions on the face if they get if they try to stop sometimes the skin becomes hyperemic with the little pimples and they can get rosacea from that and it looks really terrible and they go back on the steroid and it completely goes away but it so you get in a vicious cycle you can't come off the steroid cream steroids long-term can cause osteoporosis and they can damage the skin so it's tough to get off sometimes so you got to be careful with using steroids in your face here's a steroid rosacea patient right here trying to come off and this is what she looks like she goes back on the cream so what do we do how what's the treatment for rosacea avoid the aggravating factors like red wine isn't aureus for setting these off and I talked about some of the other ones and limit the use of or the first line of defense is low bow low Stowe low dose antibiotics if you do have some blockage of the pores of the skin and back here start building up you treat it just like you would acne with the low dose antibiotics kills the clogged up poor follicles lead to the pores I should be saying follicles anti-inflammatory properties on in low dose antibiotics so not only does it kill bugs at low doses it does have an anti-inflammatory property not enough to kill the dust mites unfortunately second line of defense is the use of isotretinoin only is this one of antibiotics don't work it so it's a medication it's a member of the retinoid family the exact mechanism of how it works is unknown but fairly effective we'll take some of the redness out of there then we have Metro gels been around it's an antibiotic typically used for mild cases of rosacea it's a cream type antibiotic you can rub on this one's used as a maintenance if you do get your rosacea under control this one is off and used for maintenance therapy and rub it on twice a day and it doesn't cause a you know it's like it's not a steroid so it's not going to give you a steroid rosacea and then the steroid cream so you again you can't typically use these things because there is a steroid rosacea that can start from the use of steroid creams so this is one time you don't use steroid creams okay one more topic we're going to cover keratosis pilaris keratosis there's pronounced just care ptosis P pilaris pilaris I call it okay this is a really interesting one completely benign condition probably 70% of us have had this especially when were younger very common it's often called goose flesh or goose bumps it's but it's really easy to confuse with real goose bumps like you get when you're cold or you're really scared but it's not goose bumps because they don't go away goose if you get scared or you get cold it goes away when you warm up and this one doesn't and no this turkey does not have keratosis pilaris but it looks really similar right you got these kind of like goose bumps things here that's not the turkey that's a human who has been exposed to cold to demonstrate goose bumps it's not that either so very common as we said it's benign it's got nothing to do with inflammation it presents as these follicular papules so the follicle again is the tube where the hair comes out of and then the pores where the hair comes out of the skin right where the pore is around the follicle is where these things occur and you get a buildup 1 to 2 centimeters you got get like a little buildup of keratin here and remember keratin is in our skin but it gets over produced like crazy in this condition so much it builds builds up and it looks like you know like a little type of Li well it is a lesion it's a lesion of keratin so these papules are made from keratin and they look like they look like goose bumps I should be look like not only like these papules are made of keratin and only look like goose bumps keratin built up surrounds the opening or that skin pore which is the open to the follicular canal does not close or clog the follicle typically like acne is a is a blockage of the follicular canal and skin pore this usually doesn't do it it's just a mound around let's take a look here a mound around the follicle or the follicular canal so the follicular canal here's the hair the root of the hair shaft of the hair so the tube that's the follow killer Canal and so where the pour is you get a huge buildup the skin is filled with keratin there's a lot of skin in karate know sites the Corney layer the last layer anyway this is like ridiculously overload with keratin and you get a raised bump because of this and we've probably all seen somebody or probably even had something like this on the lateral arm likes the the back of the legs we'll see the targets in a minute but there's a KP lesion and all this keratin gives the papules kind of a carotene is wighting color so it looks like it's filled with pus this one doesn't so much I got another one coming but it has nothing to do with pus so it's not a Whitehead and if you don't know what weight is I was zooming you know a whiteheads are those are closed comedones blackheads are open comedones but there's there's none with this condition it looks like it but there's not dermatologically KP lesions are described as hyper keratotomy clear papules hyper carry there are too much there they're papules built with too much keratin and they're built in the out part of the follicular canal where that pore is what's the prevalence 65% up to 70 up to 80% of some adults but the average is about 65% of adults will get these sorry about that I'm sorry 65% of adolescents will get these so it's really common in adolescence I used to have mine adolescence but now they completely gone one daughter still hasn't and she's she 38 or so she still hasn't 40% in adults have some degree of these things so there are some concomitant conditions we talked about atopic dermatitis was that last week I think so people with atopic dermatitis and people with ADD to pee in general have a high risk of getting these conditions and I might I mean not just getting him an adolescence I mean getting them and they stay with them into adulthood 75% of patients with ichthyosis vulgaris it's like a fish-scale skin season so they're very common in these people so I would definitely know I should have put more stars here I definitely know would know these two conditions that are associated with this here's on the back of the arm classic likes where does it likes the back the post here or post your lateral surface of the arm anterior surface of the thigh it's not dangerous psychosocial issues if it's you know bikini season and you have this really bad in your arms or legs that can be a problem but it's not dangerous dry weather especially in the wintertime ten-time tends to make that worse there's definitely a genetic connection if mom and dad have these you've got a good chance of getting them it's autosomal dominant inheritance is strongly described and it's refractory to most treatments it's tough to to get rid of this thing it just tends to go away in most people as they get older there are three subcategories of this that were I think that's beyond the scope of this class there are some associations as we said if Theo says vulgaris atopic dermatitis are the big ones it's also seen in diabetics Down syndrome and obesity patients fun facts the KP lesions are always small they're always exactly the same size acne you can have different size lesions going on so that's one way to tell it apart erythema skin or people who have really really dry skin as another one but sometimes it's superimposed on dry chapped and erythema skin sometimes there sometimes it's filled with so much keratin it looks almost white and it does look like closed comedones by the stuttering because I was thinking what was the word for dry skin zero attic skin so so people with zero Ceci's another risk for the development of KP which I didn't write down okay so here's you would think these are comedones looks like but it's not there's a red tissue here or there's a red hyperemia or Aerith emic type skin on the cheek and you see these little things this is facial KP keratosis pilaris it's not acne there's another one this is after treatment actually where it's got rid of a lot of their a Thema but you can still see the little white now those if you squeeze those nothing's gonna happen there's not any white stuff gonna come out of those because those are just little mounds of keratin same thing with these you can squeeze these things all you want and nothing's gonna come out because it's keratin there's no great treatment for these a Moylan therapy because people with super dry skins erotic skin are at risk if you take that away it tends to help them so especially in the wintertime you want to use a moisturizing cream to help that if that doesn't work then you bring out the retinoids like many other conditions retinoids do a fairly good job and it won't completely make it go away but it'll kind of calm it down and definitely take that redness out of there tretinoin is probably the big one here top of their choice retinoids can irritate the skin for being used over long period of time though so you have to be careful with that you could try a course of topical corticosteroids group 4 which will definitely take away the redness as well but be careful about that on your face though right because associated with its permanent kind of thickening of the skin you could even get the steroid rosacea going on to in some cases so if it's rough if there's a lot of those little keratin mounds you can use a Sally cyclical lotion to rub in a urea cream ammonia lactate lotion will take come some of that rough that roughness out there's some other like abrasion other bration techniques don't really for this okay on the gluteus maximus is not immune to KP alright thanks for listening make sure again you watch this in youtube because you're going to be tested on it on your midterm and this is for fall 2019 see you later",

        "published_at": "2022-01-08T13:57:09Z",
        "transcript": "Hi I\u2019m Dr. Michele Lee, a board-certified\nophthalmologist, and in this video I am going to address a very common and underdiagnosed\ncause of dry eye: ocular rosacea. So let\u2019s start by talking about rosacea. Rosacea is a skin condition of the mid-face\nthat affects up to 20% of people. People with rosacea are typically prone to\na long blush or flush that can resemble a sunburn, acne-like bumps referred to as papules\nor pustules, or skin texture changes. Rosacea tends to start around middle-age,\nin cycles, and is usually triggered by sun exposure, heat, stress, red wine and other\nalcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. While we don\u2019t really understand the mechanism\nof rosacea, we do know this is an inflammatory condition with an abnormal immune system response,\nand that there is a genetic component to this condition. There are multiple theories on why some people\nget rosacea, including theories linking the bacteria in our gut or small intestine bacterial\novergrowth and mites called Demodex that may be inducing skin inflammation. There are 4 types of rosacea and many people\naffected by rosacea may experience more than one type. Besides ocular or eye rosacea, which I will\nget to later in the video, there is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which is characterized by a prolonged\nblush and persistent redness of the face. With this type of rosacea, you can often see\nenlarged small blood vessels on the skin. Another type is papulopustular rosacea, which\nis characterized by whitehead pustules, which are red and pus-filled blemishes on the cheeks,\nchin, and forehead that are often confused with acne. The most rare and severe form is phymatous\nrosacea, which can result in thickening and discoloration of the skin. Phymatous rosacea usually affects the nose\nand is more common in men than women. So how does this condition affect our eyes? Well, this is a disease of the mid-face, and\nguess what is also in our mid-face? Our lower eyelids! In ocular rosacea, we see inflammation of\nour lower eyelids, classically lid margin telangiectasias. This is easily seen and noted with the slit-lamp\nmicroscope we use in our eye clinic. In ocular rosacea, eyelid inflammation can\ncause blockage of the meibomian, or oil, glands that provide the oil layer of our tears. Having blocked oil glands can cause a form\nof evaporative dry eye, where you make tears but don\u2019t make good quality tears to lubricate\nyour eyes and make you more prone to styes and chalazia, which are caused by blocked\nsweat and oil glands on the eyelids. In addition to dry eye, the eyelids can feel\nirritated and itchy from all the inflammation. In general, there are multiple treatments\nfor rosacea, many of which are beyond the scope of this video on ocular or eye rosacea. First and foremost, preventing and avoiding\ntriggers is the most effective thing you can do. If you suffer from rosacea, please consult with your dermatologist about a treatment plan for your\nskin that might work for you. For ocular rosacea, the treatment principles\nare similar to treating rosacea of the skin. There are a few levels of treatments that\nI discuss with my patients, depending on severity of disease and previous response to medications. Just like with skin rosacea, we want to avoid\nflares, whatever that may be. For some, this includes avoiding heat and\nwarm compresses to the eyes and eyelids, which is unfortunately an effective treatment for\nalmost every other type of dry eye. With minor irritation or symptoms, lubricating\neye drops, specifically preservative-free eye artificial tears, work best. Just how inflamed rosacea skin is sensitive,\nthe eyes and eyelids of rosacea patients are usually sensitive as well and avoiding any\ntriggers, including unnecessary preservatives, can be helpful. If preservative-free tears are not enough,\nwe might need to escalate treatment to a short-term, low-dose steroid eye drop for flares. We never want to stay on steroids for a long\ntime if we can help it, as steroid eye drops for years, even at low doses, can accelerate\ncataracts and elevate eye pressure in a small percentage of patients. Just like with other types of skin rosacea,\noral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines like doxycycline, can be effective in some cases\nof ocular rosacea. Doxycycline at low doses (under 50mg) has\nanti-inflammatory properties that both clinically and symptomatically can help with rosacea\nwhen taken long term. A newer treatment for rosacea and ocular rosacea\nis Intense Pulsed Light or IPL, a laser treatment that has been used for hyperpigmentation of\nthe skin and other types of rosacea and is now being increasingly used for ocular rosacea. This treatment can be effective with multiple\nuses, and there are some eye doctors who use a specific ocular protocol for ocular rosacea\nwith notable success. While this is still not a common tool in every\neye clinic, this is becoming increasingly popular and we might be seeing this tool in\nmore eye clinics as a treatment option for this form of dry and irritated eyes and eyelids. Do you think you might have ocular rosacea? Let me know in the comments below. As a rosacea patient myself, I am very passionate\nabout spreading awareness of rosacea and would love your support so please like and subscribe\nto my channel, and see you next week in my next video. Bye!",

        "transcript": "welcome each drone is bad the vodka independent he removed and freeze hi I'm Andrew Boyden and it's a pleasure to be speaking to dr. Margo Whitfield about rosacea today Margo is a visiting dermatologist at some Vincent's Hospital in Sydney and has written an article in the February edition of Australian prescriber and the management of rosacea Margo welcome to the program thanks very much Andrew can you firstly please provide us with an overview of the important aspects of patients first presentation that can lead to a diagnosis of rosacea and what differential diagnosis we need to be aware of when a patient presents with a red face I think there are a number of things in their history and examination that make you think of rosacea the main component is by definition flushing that's where the redness comes from that's where that term comes from and in the early stages of rosacea we often see people with flushing and then the skin goes back to normal in between episodes and this is what we kind of think of as a pre rosacea stage although some of those people don't go on to develop the more classic rosacea if the patient presents to us with a history of flushing but background redness of the skin with or without dilated blood vessels or telangiectasia then we would put them into a second level of rosacea which is really the erythema total inject attic rosacea which is the erythema and dilated blood vessels or broken blood vessels so that's as a result of the prolonged flushing if the flushing goes off in a slightly different pathway then what you can see is small red inflammatory lumps appearing on primarily the cheeks but also less commonly the forehead and the chin that sometimes associated with papules or bumps and sometimes associated with pustules at that level we would call a popular pustular rosacea if the flushing is also associated with either swelling of the nose or slight enlargement of the nose that may be a very early form of rhinophyma and occasionally people will just present to say that there's been slight change in the texture of the skin of their nose and that they can see their oil gland wouldn't fala call the next most common form of rosacea is ocular rosacea this is a combination of irritation and grittiness of their eyes often with a sensation of dry eyes maybe some conjunctivitis or conjunctival erythema plus or minus stars a very high percentage of them will also have a history of flushing and or small papules of the center of the face certainly is a diverse range of conditions and indeed that will influence our treatment decisions no doubt and we'll come to that a little bit later I think health professionals are including GPS such as myself a will aware that the skin is home to a diverse range of normal flora including bacteria that can have a role in the development of rosacea however maybe not so aware of demodex mites as skin inhabitants could you tell us a bit more about these mites and their role in rosacea demodex is the name given to these tiny parasitic mites that live around the hair and oil follicles they're less than a millimeter in size and out of interest dogs have their own type of demodex as well which can cause mange especially in puppies but in humans we have two major types that affect the skin and the hair follicles one is called demodex brevis and it ingests the oil found in the sebaceous follicle and the other one is demodex folliculorum again it ingests more keratin containing products rather than the oil ones and they found much more around the eyelashes so this adds to our mix of commensals of the skin so we really are all pairing these little mites on our skin that people will vary in terms of their poesy immunological response to them would that be correct yes I believe that sometimes we start to produce a more inflammatory response to both demodex and to some other commensal organisms making us much more likely to produce a pustule response to them now go are the certain patterns of early patient presentations for which you would recommend refer to a dermatologist or can GPS generally be confident in initiating therapy and reserving referrals for more difficult to treat cases I think that provided the general practitioner is comfortable about looking after people with rosacea then initiation is completely appropriate I think the main thing to understand though is that part of the management of rosacea has to include making the patient aware that they have a condition which is not their fault I see too many people who've been advised by friends family medical practitioners and others that the rosacea that they have is because they eat the wrong foods or they drink the wrong drinks and if they change something small that they will be able to manage it it's not suppose what comes to mind there of course is the classic large nose which people may be incorrectly assume is related to excess alcohol consumption yeah I think that for some people excess alcohol can produce flushing and for a group of people probably does contribute to a rhinophyma one of the things to remember though is that rhinophyma can occur without any alcohol and in fact many of the people who do develop rhinophyma make a conscious effort to drink either no alcohol or very little alcohol because they're worried about being perceived as someone with a major drinking problem so the group with rhinophyma i think needs early referral the other group are those who've had it for a long time and have had different types of treatments and don't know how to deal with it one of the other reasons to consider referral is if the rosacea has been difficult to manage and that there's going to have to be a broader range of options for treatment the major one that we do for that is isotretinoin isotretinoin is used both for the populo pastula and for the fire matters forms of rosacea so i think they're another group as well as possibly the people with ocular rosacea ocular rosacea can also produce a keratitis which can be catastrophic following on from the important comment that people may have this misconception that it's their fault suppose that really emphasizes how important it is around communicating the diagnosis and its implications can you comment on what you think are important educational points we need to convey to our patients at the time of diagnosis I think early on it's important to explain that this disorder is most common in fair skins their Caucasian skin the other thing that's important I think to mention is that flushing is caused by many different factors these can be from embarrassment to stress change in environmental temperature which is actually the most common drinking hot drinks eating spicy foods that's a good start I suppose that really means helping patients recognize what are the triggers for them as individuals and to learn to manage those can you also briefly summarize the medical treatments for the four subtypes one of the interesting new ways to deal with flushing is to use topical brahmanah Dean is an alpha-2 agonist and prevents the vasodilation of the skin of the face with the till inject addict form the vessels are persistently dilated so there is nothing that we can do to make those vaso constrict it means that in order to get rid of the vessels you really need to be using a form of light or destructive therapy in relation to popular pustular rosacea could you just summarize the options here and I'm interested particularly in the use of antibiotics and whether you think we need to consider resistance populo pustular rosacea can either be treated with some of the topical agents typically metronidazole gel the way that it's affecting rosacea is thought to be due to an anti-inflammatory affection so that means it helps to inhibit the amount of pustule formation that's produced there hasn't been shown to be any increase in resistance of bacteria to the use of topical metronidazole for the other topical agents got azelaic acid which is largely thought to be an anti-inflammatory or immune modulator rather than antibiotic effect however it does have some mild anti staph effect when you go back to the original literature about azelaic acid there is now a form of topical ivermectin which is used for popular pustular rosacea and its uses on the demodex might we haven't really done any research yet to find out whether topical ivermectin will alter the resistance profile of some of the other parasitic organisms that can involve the skin such as scabies when we look at the systemic agents for rosacea the most widely used one is doxycycline doxycycline and minocycline these two agents have both antibiotic effect and immune modulating effect at a dose of 40 milligrams of doxycycline it's not thought that you gets resistance we don't have that dosage yet in Australia so we can either go on a very low level of doxycycline but it will be largely having an immunomodulatory effect I understand the goal of the oral therapy is to improve the rosacea to a point where it can be controlled by topical therapies absolutely and I think it's it's really important to be able to explain to people that when you've managed to bring it under control that using the topical therapies is able to slow down the time for recurrence of the condition in summary what would you say some take-home messages in relation to the diagnosis and management of rosacea I think the major thing to explain to people is that rosacea can be a fluctuating condition and that sometimes despite all if it's there can be a flare in the skin we don't know often why this happened or whether it's a combination of stress immunologic change but again to emphasize that it's not the patient's fault that it's time to go back and get on to very gentle things for the skin such as simple emollients make sure there's no irritancy from soaps make sure there's no excessive sun exposure and just try to get back to maintaining the skin in a fairly mild state well unfortunately that's all we've got time for today thanks for joining me Margot it's been a pleasure the views of the host and the guests on the podcasts are their own and may not represent a stream prescriber or NPS medicine wise I'm dr. Andrew Borden and thanks for joining us on the Australian prescriber podcast",
