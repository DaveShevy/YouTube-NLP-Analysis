        "transcript": "now rosacea is a chronic condition which means there is no cure so treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms so in terms of treatments we do have a whole variety of what we call topical treatments such as brimwood in gel metronidazole gel which is something that I'm familiar with so for example if you presented to me with erythema which is redness of the face as well as the possible spots I'll be giving you metronidazole 0.75 gel to apply twice a day other treatments include topical Ivermectin as well as azelaic acid 0.15 percent gel which is also used for acne vulgaris but can also be used for rosacea these gels are quite effective for mild symptoms where you have your possible spots and redness of the skin as well as your dilatation of your blood vessels but you would have to use treatment for maybe between 8 to 12 weeks before you can see a resolution of your symptoms if your symptoms are quite bad we would sometimes add an alternative treatment such as an antibiotic which is taken orally such as your erythromycin Clarithromycin and your class of tetracycline such as your doxycycline or oxytetracycline and this treatment similar to your topical treatments can be used for another 8 to 12 weeks and you might find that in total use actually using this treatment for up to 16 weeks but it's quite important that you have a review of your doctor at each stage just to make sure that the treatment is working if treatment is not working then your doctor would usually refer you to a dermatologist for further treatment so doctor what can I do to help myself in terms of self-help techniques as I mentioned previously sun exposure is one of the risk factors so you might want to protect your skin by using a sun protection factor of at least 30 on your face every day try and avoid using soaps or perfumed products to wash your face as you mentioned extremes of heat or cold can worsen rosacea so you want to avoid heat or sunlight as much as possible avoid cold weather you know try and reduce your intake of alcohol avoid hot drinks whenever you can and importantly avoid stress stress is known to trigger rosacea one thing I forgot to mention which is quite important in rosacea is it can actually cause enlargement of the nose where you get this thickening and inflammation of the nose known as rhinophyma this can usually be treated with a course of Doxycycline which can be taken for up to 16 weeks if that doesn't help there is the option of laser treatment or even minor surgery now I hope you find this short talk on rosacea quite useful and please feel free to subscribe to my channel thank you",

        "transcript": "hi guys April is rosacea awareness month and if you have the skin condition you are in good company because Millions suffer from rosacea myself included I'll let you in on a little secret I did not film any videos last week because I was actually getting my treatment for rosacea which is something I do a few times a year it's a laser treatment called pulse Dye Laser also known as PDL and it can help with that flushing and redness that you get with rosacea I particularly get it on my nose and on my cheeks so it's not a particularly painful procedure but it's not comfortable either it's kind of like somebody sitting there snapping a rubber band in your face um for about you know three to five minutes here's a photo of me right after walking back to my car here's a pic at day one whoa swelling here's day two and here's day three here I am a week later most of the swelling has gone down there's some really slight erythema that mostly can be covered with makeup now usually it takes several weeks to actually notice a difference it takes a little bit for this to work oftentimes multiple treatments are necessary spaced at least a month apart and the results are not permanent so oftentimes you'll still need to get regular treatments every year in order to maintain the results so these type of lasers and other light treatments like IPL work relatively well for this particular type of rosacea called erythamato telangic tatic rosacea and that generally means you just have flushing maybe some enlarged blood vessels primarily nose cheeks maybe chin upper lip sometimes forehead in this video I'm going to discuss the different types of rosacea and different treatment options if you're just tuning in I'm Dr Abby Waldman I'm a dermatologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston so the exact cause of rosacea is unknown but is thought to be some component of environmental factors plus genetic factors there are several triggers that are known to cause flare-ups of rosacea those can include sunlight spicy food lots of caffeine intake stress exercise hot cold weather I know for me exercise and cold and hot weather are definitely triggers for my rosacea there are some recent studies that show a correlation between gastrointestinal diseases and rosacea so those who have common GI problems like Crohn's disease celiac disease ulcerative colitis IBS small intestinal bacterial overgrowth suggesting that there's some link between skin health and gut health but I definitely think more research is needed in this Arena identifying and avoiding the triggers can help reduce flares of your rosacea so I mentioned that I suffer from erythematodectatic rosacea which is just a tendency to flush and have enlarged blood vessels another type of rosacea is popular pustular type which tends to have pimples and pustules on the the nose and cheeks primarily and it can even mimic acne vulgaris the typical acne that you think of you could have a type of rosacea called ocular rosacea which involves drying of the eyes redness itching and even forming lots of little styes little bumps on the lower eyelid 5 minutes rosacea is a form where there's a body part that actually gets big and swollen especially as you get older and older the primary form is rhinophyma where your nose becomes enlarged and the tissue kind of becomes spongy granulomatous rosacea is a really severe form of rosacea there's no cure for rosacea but there are lots of medications available that can help with symptoms in addition to the laser and light treatments I mentioned for the flushing there are several topical medications that can help with flushing including brimonidine and oxymetozoline those are temporary measures they reduce redness by vasoconstricting the blood vessels and so they're a good way like before going to an event to reduce redness but they're not going to be a long-term solution other topical medications that can be prescribed or metronidazole azelaic acid and Ivermectin oral antibiotics can be prescribed to reduce inflammation oftentimes these are prescribed at low doses for really long periods of time in addition to medication you want to be super diligent about Sun Sun is a common trigger and really makes this worse if you're sensitive to sunscreen which sometimes can be the case if you have rosacea then you want to find something really gentle oftentimes you will tolerate a mineral based sunscreen more than chemical based sunscreens but really just finding one that works for you and being able to use it consistently is going to help quite a bit and then when you're really out in the sun you want to wear big broad rimmed hat you want to stay out of the direct sunlight with a cover and you want to wear protective clothing you want to avoid using harsh irritating ingredients in your skin care that being said I do know that oftentimes people really can tolerate a retinoid or a retinol but you just might have to go Go real real slow to introduce that and you want to wait until after any flare is gone and then start it once your skin is all clear and then really really slowly introduce a retinoid it actually has been shown that it could help um minimize the flares of the rosacea but if you use it while you're having a flare oftentimes it can just be a little bit too much a little bit too irritating going through it myself I know that it can be really frustrating managing rosacea there are several treatment options available and you want to seek advice from your dermatologist if

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and number two for working with us on this video as well as helping make this rosacea education and information possible but remember this is not medical information that's for your doctor to give you do remember to reapply your spf especially if you have rosacea and always remember to be youtiful both inside and out i love you beautiful butterflies and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye you",

actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big overview of rosacea what it is all the different types Medical Treatments that I recommend and then also a full AM and PM skincare routine please let me know if you have any questions let me know what

journey i'm going to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 skin condition which i have been suffering from\u00a0\nlast 15 years which is called rojasia i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to divide this video into different categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there lastly\u00a0\nbefore i go i want to say please be kind to others\u00a0\u00a0 be considerate to people who are suffering from\u00a0\nskin condition before you ask someone about their\u00a0\u00a0 face please think how you would feel if you were\u00a0\nin their shoes i feel like social media is also\u00a0\u00a0 to blame so we are conditioned to think everybody\u00a0\nneeds to have a beautiful skin you always see\u00a0\u00a0 like edited pictures flawless skin clear skin\u00a0\nin real life we have pores we have breakouts\u00a0\u00a0 we have pigmentation nobody has that porcelain\u00a0\nskin or baby like skin still today even though\u00a0\u00a0 i have a clear skin i don't have like a perfect\u00a0\nskin i feel like it is so important to normalize\u00a0\u00a0 skin conditions we need to have open dialogue\u00a0\nand open conversation in social media that is\u00a0\u00a0 how i feel anybody suffering with skin\u00a0\ncondition acne pigmentation or any sort\u00a0\u00a0 of skin condition please be kind to yourself\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching this video once\u00a0\u00a0 again and i hope you found this video helpful\u00a0\nand i'll see you guys on my next video if you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't subscribed please do i love to have\u00a0\nyou on my channel till then take care bye guys",

        "transcript": "hello to say it's been a hot minute is a drastic understatement but what I'm glad to report is that my skin is clear my rosacea people say it's incurable I don't care I never believed it I never wanted to believe it so I kept searching for me it's been since 2016 and it's now 2023. it's about time I would say and in this video I want to share with you uh the things that have really helped me have changed and revolutionized my skin I spent a long time believing that it was difficult to heal and that the more pain I put myself through the stretch of the regimen the more likely it was that I was doing the right thing and that I would get better that was never the case and I've had times where I feel like I've healed and then I've backtracked I got mold poisoning and everything came back even with a Vengeance I became you know having reactions to all types of food when I had made so much progress before and I just thought when is enough enough and it was actually last year in August when I got I was before August it was in June last year when I got covered and I got significantly worse again everything got re-triggered and activated and I was just fed up and you know in those moments where you go nut enough is enough what I'm doing is not working it has gotten me this far it's not getting me any further and you hit this like roadblock and it's so frustrating and you just want to cry and you're overwhelmed I hit that point back in June 2022 and I turned around and went I'm doing it differently so I met this friend through my blog in the raw and I had helped her with her rosacea journey and she came back around and swung back around and helped me with my rosacea Journey now her recommendation to me was to try particular products this is not a sponsored ad I have nothing to do with anything I would never do that um but I'm just going to share with you what worked because I think I owe it to you and I've I've recommended it to multiple different people and the results that they've had has just been amazing uh because it works and all of a sudden what I found in my health Journey was that it went from being super difficult to being very clear this is getting rid of the cause I don't have to like starve myself and worry about everything being just so otherwise I'm going to have this awful reaction which is what it was all of a sudden I'm getting better and better and I can eat I was so happy and it was such a relief because every day my skin is getting consistently better consistently better consistently better and it's just like for the first time it's not get a bit better get a little bit worse get a bit better get a little bit worse and just like this journey of just uncertainty and like is it this is it that enough you know we have to deal with enough things that we shouldn't be having to worry you know constantly about what we eat about changing our pillow every five minutes about worrying about touching our face and just all these like finicky things that we we obsess over when we have such severe issues we think oh if we do all these miniature things like then my skin will be okay as if it's your fault that your skin is not okay that you are doing something fundamentally wrong well sometimes it's about finding the root of how it occurred and allowing yourself to enjoy life and ease into the things that you want to ease into um so this is what these products did for me and oh I should probably show you what they are I didn't organize that very well this is a bit impromptu so the products that I started using were recommended by my friend who also had a severe formal rosacea very similar presentation to mine we have very different Journeys but very similar presentation and I was super skeptical at first I was I it actually she recommended to me nine months earlier and I kept thinking to myself I wish I tried this earlier uh but who cares it was perfect timing that's just the same it was perfect timing so I tie the products I but before I did I start going no like I just nosedive into all of this person's content he was originally a doctor dermatologist who got sick of the fact that the typical way that Dermatology functions the options are laser antibiotics or anti-inflammatories all of which can cause a lot of damage and for many of you I know because I speak to so many people around the world their rosacea got significantly worse after taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatories because it exacerbates the underlying cause now controversial thing to say but I'm going to say it so he started questioning that and started formulating uh and researching to what might work and rosacea is such a complex skin condition it seems to be one of the most difficult skin conditions and the one that doctors seem to believe cannot be eradicated cannot be reversed but I have reversed the vast majority of my allergies before I get to the solution I just want to share with you something so exciting for the past three weeks I have been eating gluten I've been eating all these things that I normally would be like I'm never eating that again it's so bad for you um and just enjoying food and just loving life um so uh and I still listen to my body anyway the point is let's get to the product so I started using and researching and deep diving into a product called as osmosis or a brand called osmosis I began with their rescue serum uh which helped with my dry painful red and flaky skin it was so painful and so red I'll show you before and afters um I mean you can see the after but the befores of when I start before I started using these products it's just crazy like the inflammation not just the redness and the bumps I had like a nose bump like this but also the puffiness of my eyes the swelling of my cheeks like I also had like a double chin um even though I'm the same size so I was just overall really inflamed and swollen and that's because it's autoimmune issues now I thought on the rescue and immediately I felt insane relief like previously I had been putting on so much Derma vigils like just slapping on the lipids just to try and almost like a Vaseline just like trying to cover my um my barrier so that it would not be leaking moisture all the time because it was so itchy and so sore I was applying it multiple times a day I couldn't go anywhere without it I would never ever dream of you know not cleansing my face or going through my routine if I woke up I immediately had to go to the bathroom and wash my face because I was in agony always when I wake up when I go to bed now sometimes I forget to wash my face I actually don't know who I am anymore I'm pretty good though like it's it's not a regular occurrence but that's the level I don't it it's not like an everyday Obsession because it's not painful it's it's livable I mean it's pretty good so okay rescue fantastic product it's a DNA Repair Serum it helps to heal scars does all these things for collagen look it up um I'll probably put some links below uh so that you can have a little bit of a look-see but Dr Ben Johnson has so much so many YouTube videos online I'll tell you all the other things that I also used as well so I started with rescue and I also started with regenerate which was a liver it's meant to help regenerate the liver and help the liver so Dr Ben's theory is that with rosacea it's either liver induced or it's candida introduced and he has things on the website to determine what that is you can also email him uh and I'll put his email down below you can email him personally and he will respond to you um for free so that's really generous um it's getting harder and harder for him to do it within you know a week or so but it's worth it regenerate he told me I needed to go on it for nine months I hit the nine month Mark I think a month ago um and now I'm off all the internal products and my skin stays consistently really good it's improving all the time every month and so regenerate was the second one I also after I started doing the regenerate I was making a lot of progress but I wasn't making it's like I was making progress in some areas of my skin and not in other areas and when I sent some photos to Dr Ben he said you also have candida rosacea so I went on his candida protocol as well as the liver protocol and I started as I was detoxing my skin that's why I started with the rescue because it helps detox as well detox and heal after I started with the rescue I started adding other elements into my regimen but if it was causing the detox to happen too strongly I would pair back and wait I think it took me three months before I could go on some of these other repair serums I went on stem factor which helps with like collagen and scarring and then I also wanted to try Catalyst Ace 11. once you start learning about all these incredible products and what they do for your skin it's like I want to try I want to try but you have to slow down and so I now have implemented I've got stem Factor rescue the um correct serum I started off with calm which is better for rosacea skin you start off with calm and then uh Catalyst ac11 every now and again um and that's really good for elasticity and it's just all of it helps with different things for the skin especially when you're doing repair like I've had almost what seven years of skin damage and breakage to make up for so my skin is loving it the first thing I realized when I put this topical stuff on my skin was oh it's fading my skin my my skin feels fed uh so that was really great and then um yeah so you can look up what his candida protocol is it's um something called uh you take these capsules called clarify it helps you clear out mucus which apparently is what candida different types of candida feeds off and then you take this like spray Elixir thing which helps reduce the population of the candida so I did that for three months and noticed significant effects and then I just continued to improve as I continue to take regenerate and I also took his fat supplement which I forget the name of at this point in time uh that one's really amazing as well I took that for three months because I in the past had really bad I just I just didn't have enough natural oils and lipids in my skin um that's also something that could help aid your skin as well as not having enough oils because I wasn't absorbing it because my liver wasn't functioning properly so I wasn't absorbing fat and I've noticed like I used to have a lot of pulling like my skin was pulling and tight because it didn't have enough lipids and fats and I've done you know a lot of skin scans now and the pulling is no longer there so my skin is now like having this vibrant lipid look the youthful look or whatever I know I'm younger whatever I did have like all these what appeared to be like all these Fine Lines because my skin was so dry I would highly recommend giving it a go emailing Dr Ben again this isn't sponsored but I just wanted to give you guys an update because I want more people to know about what works and at the end of the day it's all about having a better relationship with your body learning to love yourself more and living the most vibrant life you can so you can start giving to others one of the things that I struggle with the most and I think we do struggle with in self-esteem when your skin severely affects your life especially with more severe skin conditions or ones that are autoimmune related they really significantly can impact your life and it impacts your ability to contribute to the world to actualize yourself to Greater to Greater degrees it might affect travel it might affect the activities you participate in it may affect the you know the confidence level of you to be able to make contacts and friends and further yourself and your career it might reduce your ability to earn and therefore give back to society maybe you want to make more contributions to Charities causes all these things like it affects every area of your life and people don't realize the significant impact and so that's why I'm sharing this with you because I feel like the past nine months of my life 10 months I think it's 10 or 11 months now I can't even count anymore I've just lost track have been transformed because of this so let me know how you go let me know your thoughts let me know if you've tried it before and yeah I would love to see how it helps you and if you tried it as a result of watching this video anyway lots of love to you and um good luck on your skin Journey",

        "published_at": "2023-02-03T17:00:28Z",
        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry a family physician and in this short video let's talk about the rosacea diet and how to reverse the redness associated with rosacea the redness the scaling the blood vessels are embarrassing over 400 million people on the planet suffer from rosacea and I have a secret to tell you later in this video that you might not believe what if I told you that the cause of your rosacea is not some of the triggers you've been told about but it's actually your diet it's what you've been eating and it's what you've not been eating that's what's causing your rosacea that's what this video is all about now if you know someone suffering from rosacea please take a second and share this video with them so that they will know there is hope and there is a solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "description": "Do you know that mites are thought to be a contributing factor in Rosacea? Hi friends! In this video, we explore what Rosacea is ...",
        "published_at": "2021-11-26T18:06:23Z",
        "transcript": "would you believe me if i tell you that the mites on your face are causing these red angry looking bums also known as rosacea hi friends i'm chris and i'm a dermatology trainee working in the west of scotland in the uk and in this video i'm going to dive straight into the topic rosacea specifically we're going to cover what it is how it looks like as well as the various steps and treatments we can do to help prevent and manage this common skin condition we are also going to touch on the things that you can do to help with your skin as well as the various treatment options we have in dermatology in the uk so what on earth is rosacea well this is a very common skin condition predominantly affecting the middle age groups as well as people with fair skin we don't exactly know what causes this but it is thought to be due to a combination of genes environmental factors as well as an overabundance of a type of mite also known as the demodex mites now these are small little creatures that love growing and crawling around the hair follicles and it's actually present in every single one of us however in people with rosacea it is thought that they are more sensitive to these mites and thereby causing inflammation of the skin leading to flushing and redness rosacea can also be triggered by a variety of things which i've listed in this video and the most common trigger that we see in our clinics is actually direct sunlight and this is why we always advise our patients to wear sunscreen at all times to help prevent rosacea there are of course other known triggers such as caffeine in your tea coffee alcohol spicy food and even exercise and it's actually really anything that makes your blood vessels beneath the skin dilate causing the flushing and redness you see in rosacea now i think it's important for us to classify the rosacea into various subtypes as they can look quite different and also the treatments for each subtype can be different as well one of the commonest subtype of rosacea is the erythematolangitic rosacea also known as the vascular rosacea this can be quite a mouthful to pronounce but essentially patients presents with flushing redness of the face and telangiectasia which also means dilated blood vessels now the flushing is usually temporary at the start but as the rosacea worsens it can become permanent the other very common subtype of rosacea is the papillopascillar rosacea also known as the inflammatory rosacea and in this subtype patients get this angry looking red bumps also known as papules and pasteurs which are essentially papules containing parts inside now i think it is important for us to identify papillopascular variant of rosacea as they can look quite similar to acne vulgaris and so you may ask how do i actually tell the difference well essentially the triggers for rosacea don't necessarily exacerbate acne the other important thing to note is that the lesions for rosacea typically affect the central face so this would include the forehead both cheeks the nose and the chin and they typically spare the temples and the sides of the jawline of the face lastly in rosacea we don't normally get the white or blackheads that you see in acne and these are also known as comedomes which are basically clogged up hair follicles now the other two subtypes are not as common but we do still see them in our practice one of them is called the ocular rosacea and as the name suggests ocular meaning eye patients with this type of rosacea typically get eye symptoms such as burning itching and grittiness of the eyes and if this is left unchecked and untreated it can cause permanent scarring and so it is important for you to seek help quite early on so that you can get the appropriate management the last subtype is the phymatus rosacea also known as rhinophyma now this subtype is particularly difficult to treat and essentially means thickening and deformity of the skin particularly affecting the nose so your usual creams gels lotion and potions that you use to treat rosacea probably wouldn't work for this subtype of rosacea and you may need more aggressive treatments like laser therapies and even surgery so now you may ask how do we treat rosacea the important thing for any subtype of rosacea is to identify and potentially avoid or limit any triggers triggering rosacea what i'll recommend is to keep a diary for anything that can exacerbate your rosacea and try to limit or cut down one trigger at a time you don't have to be prescriptive about this because ultimately it is your quality of life we are talking about and it's all about weighing the pros and cons when it comes to avoiding things you may like so for example if your rosacea is triggered by eating spicy food and you just so happen to love spicy food and you eat spicy food every single time it is probably quite difficult and even impossible for you to limit eating spicy food because it will just make you very miserable so instead of avoiding things completely you may wish to perhaps limit the amount of exposure and be more rigorous when it comes to your skin care regime another important thing you can do is to treat your skin as though it is super sensitive always always remember to wear a good sunscreen as we know sunlight is the number one trigger for rosacea wearing sunscreen not only prevents rosacea it also helps reduce the risk of skin cancer and slows down aging another tip is to use non-fragrance and non-comedogenic facial cleansers and moisturizers which help protect the skin berry function try to find cleansers that are more acidic with a ph similar to the skin so between four to five rather than harsh soaps which are more alkaline and can be quite irritating and traumatic to the skin an example you can try is the serraphy hydrating facial cleanser another important tip is to keep your skin care as simple as possible now for patients who have sensitive skin who are more prone to getting acne and rosacea i would advise against using toner because toner can actually strip off the essential oils and moisture in your skin making it more inflamed so for specific subtypes like for example the erythematologic rosacea other than the advice that i've given before and doctors in the uk can also prescribe a topical gel called movaso gel which contains bromonidin 0.03 now this is licensed and indicated for facial redness and flushing and we typically advise patients to use once a day the only issue with this gel is that it can cause rebound redness when it's stopped and so it's often quite difficult when patients try to come off it another treatment that we can offer in the uk is an oral medication called propranolol which helps to shrink down any dilated blood vessels now as you can imagine this is an oral tablet so it can cause systemic side effects such as slowing your heart rate down and so this is something that we don't normally prescribe in the uk for rosacea unless it is absolutely crucial also if your facial redness is permanent causing discomfort and psychological distress sometimes we can think of laser treatments for example ipl and housed dye laser the only thing is that i'm not exactly sure if these treatments are still available under the nhs which is the national health service for those people living in the uk as such and you may wish to consider going for these treatments privately but make sure that you seek out a reputable and recognized healthcare professional who knows what they are doing you may also wish to consider camouflage makeup with a green tinted base to help correct the redness and help even out the skin tone now in the uk there is a camouflage service provided by a charity called changing faces and this is something that you can register either yourself or get your gp to refer you onwards to this service and in this service what they do is that they would look at your skin tone show you the products that they use the different shades that would match your skin tone as well as how to apply the products now for people who are suffering from the papillopascular type of rosacea we do have a variety of treatments available for people who are suffering from mild to moderate symptoms we can offer topical treatments in the first instance and in the uk there are three mainstay topical treatments we offer the first one is ivamatin cream also known as cilantra which you can apply once a day to the affected areas for up to four months the other treatment is metronidazole gel also known as rosex gel which you can apply twice daily for up to four months and lastly we have the acelic acid 15 cream with the brand name being called phoenicia and we often ask patients to apply to their face twice a day for up to six months these treatments are typically prescribed by your healthcare professional in the uk but i think you can get the acelic acid treatments over the counter through brands like the ordinary products choice as well as natural once the rosacea is more well controlled you can then reduce the frequency down to once or twice a week as a form of maintenance therapy if your symptoms are more severe then we may consider a combination of oral antibiotic and the topical treatments and the oral antibiotics include things like lemon cycline and doxycycline now bear in mind this is a prescription only medication and so you may wish to speak to your healthcare professional like your gp or local dermatologist in your area to find out more the aim of using antibiotics is more for the anti-inflammatory properties rather than antibacterial and typically patients stay on the antibiotics for at least three months for it to actually work now if the symptoms continue to be persistent despite topical and oral antibiotics sometimes in dermatology we offer low-dose isotretinoin also known as roaccotin now this is a treatment similar to that for acne severe acne in fact but actually the dose used for rosacea is much lower than that used for acne now as for people suffering from the phymatis variant of rosacea and the topical treatments and as well as the or antibiotics they won't work because of the deformity and soft tissue swelling in this case sometimes we can refer you onwards to laser treatments as well as surgical interventions to help remove the excess soft tissue and as far as i know these services are still available in some health boards across the uk so you may wish to speak to your local dermatologist to find out more now for people who are suffering from eye symptoms or ocular rosacea other than minimizing the aggravating factors like for example excessive central heating excessive air conditioning and even smoky environments i think it is important for you to make sure that you keep your eyelids as clean as possible this means cleaning them with a cotton wool soaked in warm water and if you get sticky bits underneath your eyelids you can wash them with using baby shampoo also if your eyes get dry you can buy over the counter lubricating eye drops and try to go for the ones without preservatives to keep your eyes moisturized throughout the day one thing that people don't realize is that sometimes medications can exacerbate eye dryness so have a look at your regular medications particularly if you are on a lot of regular medications such as certain antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications as they can sometimes exacerbate eye dryness in dermatology we sometimes use all antibiotics to help dampen down inflammation but if your eye symptoms are very bad and severe we can refer to our ophthalmology colleagues in the eye clinic for their review as well now before i close off this video i just want to say that oftentimes we underestimate how distressing skin conditions can be for people i know that it is not the same as say if someone suffers a stroke or a heart attack rosacea is not life-threatening but they can cause a huge impact on our daily activities and social life skin conditions can make you look and feel different from the people around you and this ultimately can cause you to lose confidence in yourself and cause self-esteem issues i just want to say that for anyone who is watching this video suffering from any skin condition no matter how severe or mild it may be and if you are suffering from this and please don't suffer this alone speak to someone about it and get help as soon as possible there are tons of support groups online and that can help support you through this journey i myself suffered from really bad severe acne and this had caused significant long-term scarring which i still have to this day and so i hope by doing these videos i would empower you guys including healthcare professionals and with the necessary tools and knowledge in tackling of these skin conditions at an early stage i will also provide several links down in the description box below which you may want to check out if you want to read out more about rosacea and if you're interested to know more about skin conditions in general do check out my video on keratosis polaris where i talk about another very common skin condition that pretty much almost everyone suffers from thank you for watching see you later bye",

        "published_at": "2021-07-31T14:00:20Z",
        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "why hey guys happy of October day 26 welcome back to the Q&A today's Q&A is for all of those rosacea sufferers out there who have been requesting a Q&A on cilantro or topical ivermectin for rosacea if you're not familiar with rosacea it is a fairly common skin condition God is characterized by a tendency towards redness on the face and the central face with flushing and it's really a challenging skin disease for sufferers to navigate because anything they put on their face whether it be sunscreen or face wash moisturizer makeup and often can sting and burn and precipitate a flare of redness in addition to redness and kind of a flushed appearance people with rosacea also suffer from red bumps papules pustules most commonly overlying the central face around the nose as well and sometimes the skin can become thick swollen and over time develop a almost dilated pore type appearance that can really bother people people may describe this as a textural but really it's just the inflammation of the rosacea kind of distorting the architecture of the skin anatomy a little bit without swelling and redness the pathophysiology of rosacea appears to be multifactorial it largely is determined probably by our genetics which we have to thank for many things as well as environmental conditions it can flare we know with ultraviolet light exposure changes in the humidity and things that we put on our face can also precipitate a flare of rosacea certain foods in our diet can can precipitate a flare and then some people many people with rosacea it has been demonstrated have a high burden of something called demodex mites on theirs demodex mites sound really terrifying and they freak everyone out they are a component of normal skin flora everyone has demodex mites they don't cause rosacea per se it appears that people with rosacea because they are so sensitive to things on the skin they may have a sensitivity to demodex and for whatever reason they also have a high burden of demodex mites on their skin in comparison to people who do not have rosacea and it's thought that this kind of excess burden of demodex as well as the sensitivity to these little mites can contribute to the redness the flushing and the severity of an individual's rosacea so this is where the topical drug cilantro or ivermectin comes into play ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that has been around for about 20 years and it has a very wide safety margin and is used to treat many many many parasites both in human medicine as well as veterinary medicine I not only systemic parasites but different kinds of parasites and mites that may get on on your skin and cause rashes so this cream became of interest for people with rosacea given the fact that it had been demonstrated that people with rosacea have a higher burden of demodex on their skin the way cilantro or ivermectin works is it has very very very high affinity and selectivity for a non channel that is present in invertebrate muscle cells and nerve cells so it binds to that little channel and can affect the way signaling occurs across those cell membranes in the mite or the parasite the invertebrate and effectively paralyze it so it's a kind of a it's a paralytic agent essentially it's selective only for the might has really no no consequences to human health animal health it doesn't cross our blood-brain barrier so it can't affect the nerves in our central nervous system at all and it's very safe and even safer when applied topically in a cream form such as with cilantro repurposing an old drug for a new indication is nothing new in medicine and occurs frequently for a variety of conditions and other drugs as well topical cilantro or ivermectin was first examined and randomized controlled trials of people with populo pustular rosacea people with the type of rosacea that's comprised of that the red bumps applied topically to the entire face once a day for 12 weeks was shown to not only be effective at reducing the burden of inflammatory lesions but also is very very well tolerated and actually in comparison to the vehicle arm or the cream without the active drug in it they actually had fewer side-effects of stinging and irritation so it's safe it's effective and it's very well tolerated then later on cilantro was compared in 16 week trials to a standard of care treatment for rosacea which is topical metronidazole 0.75% and after 16 weeks and of treatment the group getting the cilantro actually had better overall improvement in their burden of rosacea papules and pustules in comparison to those receiving metronidazole topically so it appears that cilantro or ivermectin is is much more effective or a little bit more effective at least down than topical metronidazole and in other studies looking at it in Arsen azelaic acid it seems to be kind of comparable to azelaic acid or Phoenicia for rosacea i have a video on as a white acid so it's not something that you are interested in make sure you check that video out it like all of my q and a's are found in a playlist called skincare q and A's you'll find that there to be q and A's on rosacea and various topical drugs used to treat rosacea so go check in there if you have any any other questions I may have already addressed them but overall topical cilantro is pretty effective for popular pustular rosacea and is very safe and is very well tolerated it is pregnancy category C so it is not indicated during pregnancy unfortunately whereas azelaic acid is okay in pregnancy but otherwise it's very safe and when applied to the skin is absorbed systemically at a very very low amount and even even that which is absorbed we know to be safe because it is far less than what it's given in oral doses it's largely more effective for the papules or the bumps and pustules to those components of the rosacea that look like whiteheads it's largely effective at reducing the burden of those it can lessen some of the severity of persistent facial redness but it will not unfortunately wipe away that facial redness completely but it will it will help substantially for both the popular pustular lesions as well as at least in my experience with this drug some of that persistent redness although again it will not completely erase the redness but when coupled with something like pulsed dye laser however the outlook at improving persistent facial redness you can imagine improves even moreso than either treatment by itself so the combination of the two can really offer an individual great potential for substantial and cilantro will be effective in anywhere from 40 to 80% of people using it and as far as how well it is tolerated probably about one in 88 or so individuals will stop using it after a year due to side effects like stinging or burning or irritation if you have rosacea you know that can be the case with pretty much anything you put on your face so it's not surprising that cilantro is not an exception but in comparison to other topical treatments used for rosacea it actually seems to be much better as far as those side effects of stinging and irritation but invariably somebody's going to have problems with it it is not going to work for everybody with rosacea and there's you really know what good way to know for sure if it will be effective for you now the follow-up question that everybody will want to know is well do I have to use it forever what happens when I stop using it well following discontinuation unfortunately symptoms will return within about four months in roughly half of people so while it can offer sustained control after cessation that is not always the case in fact about 50% of people the symptoms will return when they stop when they stop the drug so something that has to be continued for many people for the long term that being said one thing to bear in mind is that it is not a cheap drug unfortunately it should be but it is not so a one month supply of topical cilantro roughly a month treatment that cost around three hundred and twenty dollars here in the United States in comparison to metronidazole which is about roughly a hundred and twenty dollars so quite a bit more expensive oral doxycycline a pill that you may have taken for rosacea is also quite a bit cheaper than a topical cilantro now your health and the way you feel about yourself the control of your rosacea should not be dictated by price but I'm telling you this because given that there are other effective treatments for rosacea don't be surprised unfortunately if your health insurance declines coverage of the cilantro sometimes they'll cover it with a prior authorization letter written by your dermatologist I find it to be very helpful for pata papules and pustules of rosacea and to impart modest improvement in persistent facial redness related to rosacea and it also enhances the outcomes of other treatments like I said like pulse dye laser but yeah that's really all there is to it for cilantro it's great that we've found and you used for an old drug I'm Remington I just wish there wasn't it wasn't quite so expensive it does offer quite a bit of hope for people with rosacea and improving their their burden of disease and so I hope that this video was helpful and kind of going over how effective it is that it's very well tolerated and hopefully gave you some information how it compares to some of the other standard of care treatments which you may have already tried and been frustrated with so again I hope this video was helpful to you guys and kind of answering your questions and if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe guys tomorrow [Music]

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "published_at": "2021-01-24T21:58:21Z",
        "transcript": "this is one of the topics i've been waiting to talk about for for a very very long time you know this is such a hard topic to get into because there's just so much going on and it's really not that clear what causes a lot of these things and our body of evidence continues to grow but it's just so difficult to treat so difficult to get under control and also i feel like every person i've ever treated with this seems to respond differently to different types of medication and so for this particular one please bear with your dermatologist please bear with your products this is going to be a trial and error type of condition yeah it's so highly individualized and that's why i really wanted to talk about it because i think it's portrayed and it on our end you know really is one disease spectrum uh but in my mind i i really consider each of the subtypes of this topic as almost different entities because different things seem to trigger it different things definitely treat it one size does not fit all for this absolutely so what are we talking about we're talking about rosacea the massive topic of rosacea sometimes you notice redness in your face sometimes you notice pimples on the sort of central part of your face sometimes it affects your eyes sometimes it makes your nose much larger so there's there's all these different kind of forms of it but the sort of overarching theme is something called rosacea so we're going to talk about each of these major four subgroups of rosacea and look there's more we're not going to talk about those we're just talking about the major four groups of rosacea a little bit about what's going on with each of these types and then also really try to focus in on treating each one individually uniquely and charging the things that cause it here we go here we go okay so let's start what are the four main types of rotation all right four main types we're gonna spend the most time on the first two the first one erythro telangiectatic rosacea what so i'm so glad so the reason why i just asked him how what the four types were was because i knew i was going to struggle through that one so i was like well maybe turf it to him and see him struggle through it but he did pretty good isn't there a t in there erythromato oh crap erythro erythema mata or earth no i forget it erythrotolycitic rosacea all right maybe type one so what does that one look like all right the erythrotylene categorization long word vessel rosacea vascular rosacea so you're gonna see prominent redness the vessels are dilated there's a background of redness that becomes persistent underlying dilated vessels so redness definitely for that one and then the next type is the next type is the papular pustular variant the one that looks like acne looks like acne but it's sort of in a different distribution and some of your historically hero ingredients for acne such as retinoids can sometimes make this type of rosacea or bumps on the face worse and so important to get the correct diagnosis on this one but it tends to affect more of the central face and sometimes can even cause thickening of the skin and things like that but ultimately a papulo pustular rosacea type two yeah the age group's a little different too often times it's like post adolescence middle of adulthood comes on it's like i've never had acne before why the heck am i getting it now maybe it's not acne it's probably not malacea folliculitis could be it's this time rosacea exactly so type three what's another third type type three feminists feminist oil gland rosacea so thickening of the skin these are the people that you see that kind of get those much larger noses and can kind of be a little bit disfiguring of the thymus form of rosacea it's very very discouraging for people very difficult actually you can also get an individually enlarged oil glands throughout the face and an overall greasy complexion with this too so it is my belief that dr maxfield has feminist rosacea uh he refuses to accept that fact but um i am encouraging him to seek treatment for five minutes rosacea as i'm an expert diagnostician but he offers no treatment so what a worthless worthless friend so then the fourth type of rosacea uh fourth type of rosacea ah oh what's happenization this one's really important guys look fourth type of rosacea is ocular rosacea eye rosacea really important because you know mild moderate severe but the severe type it actually can lead to difficulty seeing it can lead to some real damage of the eye so this one goes mist because it's really not huge it's not part of the skin components and so a lot of times people with this just don't even realize that it's a part of rosacea and they may take a long time to seek care right and you get a lot of redness dryness in the eyes from this as well um so definitely important to seek treatment for this as well okay the first one we'll talk about we're going to spend a good amount of time on this one the vascular rosacea what's causing it what's going on vascularization what's causing it what's going on yeah so what is causing it what's going on so important these are the things that you're going to want to avoid so importantly there's kind of two factors here there's almost this neural cause and then there's this vascular component as well and they kind of work interchangeably and so the nerves sort of being hyper-reactive in this area plus the vasculature also being hyper-reactive in this area kind of leaves this dilated appearance of redness that's in the central face and you can actually see visible blood vessels as this sort of progresses initially starts off as redness but they can progress to just these visible and persistent blood vessels on the surface of the skin yeah so the key important thing here is it starts with that transient flushing so you're the type of person that you get flushing that lasts for a really prolonged period of time like 30 minutes after you get nervous you're blushing you drink some alcohol spicy food you did all at once on a dinner date but you're like stuck you're just red for the next 30 minutes but then it goes away but then it becomes persistent you get a background of redness the dilated blood vessels come on over a period of years and they stay okay so for this redness form of rosacea that's through the cheeks um what are the things that we have to avoid because that's probably something that i you know i like to talk a lot about is is things that you know what you want to avoid that are potentially making this thing worse so what's the most important thing you would say there are so many things that trigger this uh most important thing you know it may actually even be sun that's what i would say the sun right so so just because i always want to plug sunscreen at some point you know this is this is really important actually and this is something that i actually didn't know well i knew that the sun caused rosacea to be worse but what i didn't actually know about was the role of uvb yeah so uvb and you know this is something i feel like is very undertalked about uvb actually in these patients can stimulate angiogenesis what that means it stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so ubb from the sun uh uvb radiation ultraviolet radiation can stimulate your blood vessels to proliferate get larger spread roots ultimately and that leads to rosacea so actually we do know directly that uvb from the sun is playing a role in your rosacea so very important sun protection something that's a broad spectrum sunscreen is going to be very very important and then avoiding irritating things especially for this group of people this group of rosacea so for rosacea i would say treat your skin like you have sensitive skin definitely that great point you really want to just kind of basically avoid anything that somebody with eczema or atopic dermatitis would want to avoid you want to be very cautious with your skin care products because we know that irritation can inflame this issue so you want to avoid things like fragrance you want to avoid things like irritating or drying alcohols like your isopropyl alcohol or your vodka or vodka well you do actually you do if you drink it flushes actually if you consume alcohol it will make it worse that's true actually so you also want to not consume alcohol or just be aware that when you consume alcohol they can cause flushing and make these things worse and so mechanical scrub alcohol spicy food as well can make it worse that's something like i probably would never give up if i had rosacea i would just continue to do it forever i ordered everything extra spicy i eat um the flamin hot cheetos every day i'm eating hot fries every day i get flaming hot everything at this point so what are some irritating ingredients and skincare products that you would want to avoid they could potentially make this type of rosacea worse long list but a short version of it we have witch hazel we have camphor menthol eucalyptus oil peppermint oil you know it's kind of a common theme these things smell pretty strong they'll have that a lot of them have a minty kind of sensation and look it's not like that's bad inherently it's just for people with rosacea it can irritate it and perpetuate the underlying cause right so these things tend to be pro-inflammatory or tend to make redness ultimately worse and you'd want to avoid them so interestingly it appears that every male targeted skincare line is loaded with this kind of stuff it has either tons of menthol peppermint eucalyptus like for some reason i like every men's skincare line has to smell like a mint isn't that like a thing why is that happening listen up skincare brands you need to stop putting menthol eucalyptus peppermint anything minty in your men's targeted skincare lines all right you know what also though we have to talk about ph balance and so another thing with this look obviously the overarching theme for this vascular rosacea you have sensitive skin ph balance is actually important when you're picking a cleanser a lot of these beauty cleansers actually are pretty good your skin lives at a ph of about 5.4 it's actually a little acidic soap is extremely alkali it has a really high ph bar soap ph greater than like eight nine so pick a gentle mild cleanser so you don't get irritation that's gonna perfect that's going to exacerbate this redness so as far as the cleanser goes simple gentle cleanser something that's not going to irritate rosacea or make it worse it doesn't necessarily need to treat your rosacea at this point you just want to use something that's going to be very gentle so just two recommendations i have for you serve hydrating cleanser hydrating facial cleanser is going to do great for most skin types and the vani cream cleanser as well so vanity cream very gentle brand dermatologists love banana cream so also a good option gentle cleanser at this point you don't want anything overly stripping even if you have more of that acne type of rosacea where you see bumps on the skin still gentle cleanser is going to still be my recommendation for you so there are a lot of treatments out there you know marketed at people for rosacea but sort of the main ones that i kind of want to recommend for you all as a good starting point for the redness aspect and the redness tends to be one of the hardest things to treat because a lot of times like i said it's those vessels and sometimes you need to ablate or get rid of those vessels with the laser date you know really see a huge improvement but to try to help a little bit with the redness i have two recommendations for you uh one would be the procure rosicare product and the reason that i like this one it contains licorice and niacinamide licorice is very good for redness rosacea inflammation and niacinamide also very good for redness inflammation as well also it contains alan tone which is a soothing and calming ingredient that can also help with redness and the other thing i like about this product is that it contains chromium oxide greens which give you almost an immediate benefit with your redness because the surface is more of a concealer of the redness and why is this we got to bring it back to the color wheel color wheel classic you all know i like the paint if you don't i do i actually like yeah he's actually a really good painter it turns out ultimately on the color wheel spectrum we know that opposites cancel each other out well what's the opposite of red green green so if you use a green concealer or something with greens in it it will help to offset some of that redness almost immediately this product actually contains green chromium oxides it's going to help to cancel out a little bit of that redness so it's going to be very good especially for the daytime so you would use that after you cleanse you'd put this procure rosa care on and then you would put your sunscreen or moisturizer on afterwards my second product recommendation here is going to be the cetaphil redness relief the cetaphil product all right it has some of the similar things it has niacinamide it has licorice but this one also has caffeine it's actually a nice component to help shrink up blood vessels and i know there's a little controversy does it shrink them up does it dilate them my personal opinion is that it actually works better to constrict the blood vessels so yeah so now it has three ingredients very good for redness um this one's also fragrance free and so it's not going to really irritate your skin like we said we want to avoid things that are going to make this worse and so definitely very good product for that also has some other soothing ingredients like alan toen and ceramides and ceramides help to kind of restore restore that sort of injured moisture barrier that you have so uh two product recommendations there um for this type of rosacea that's one that was one part of rosacea okay so we talked about the vascular rosacea we talked about what causes it we talked about what triggers it what you can stop doing to help trigger it and what you can do to treat it moving on to number two remember we said we're gonna spend most of our time on one and two two is the acne form version two is papulo pustular rosacea little bumps in the center of the face looks like acne papulo puzzler rosacea what causes this all right so this is where the inflammatory component of rosacea kinda comes in it's a lot of baseline inflammation that may be triggered actually by in part with the genetic component mites yeah you got mites on your skin you all knew that though you guys knew because we told you about the mites before so uh there's something called the demodex mic um that seems to play a role we've actually found that treating this d mid-x miter getting rid of the steven x mic can actually get rid of your rosacean some people and so uh the demon x mic is playing a role in the inflammation that is causing rosacea in some people this type of rosacea is one of the most amenable to treatment actually this one responds pretty well to a lot of different treatment options the most important thing we can tell you with this one and what you're doing to treat it is it looks like acne and as dr shaw said vitamin a does not help as much for this so your retinoids retinol can cause a lot of irritation with this um so you want to be careful with those can they work can they be effective they can they can be but yeah you want to you want to maybe kind of go more on the gentle side try something a little bit more gentle for this type of rosacea this is the one that also responds really well to your prescription medications as well your oral antibiotics and things like that yep responds really well but yeah you've rosacea you still have sensitive skin so those vitamin a's that do great in acne you may not tolerate it i really want to give you something that's going to like treat these mites but i found out and was really disappointed that there's no over-the-counter cream anti-scabies cream anti-white cream that's really available to you so we had to dig we had to look what can help you and we found the old tried tested true shrewd sulfur sulfur so sulfur is probably one of the most underrated skin care ingredients that exists it is very beneficial in acne very beneficial in rosacea so um sulfur actually has a dual purpose i love dual purpose it just helps when you don't know what you're treating [Laughter] no but um sulfur excellent ingredient um very effective for rosacea why is this it has anti-inflammatory properties inherently and it also has some effect at reducing the mites on your skin so some of my over-the-counter recommendations for this would be rosacea rosacea contains sulfurin it's going to be effective for this type of rosacea the only kind of downside to this is it does contain a propylene glycol which is actually a pretty common allergen in people and so if you do have sensitive skin you definitely want to stay away from something that contains propylene glycol but the sulfur is something that you can find over the counter that's very effective they also have sulfur bar soaps that they sell on amazon we'll link a couple products below that's going to have the sulfur in it but sulfur is going to be a hero ingredient in this type of acne yeah absolutely and this type of rosacea and this type of acne rosacea so then my second hero ingredient here which is probably one of my favorite ingredients of all time mine too no it's mine no yeah but i've also no like it has two levers this is mine no it i know i loved it before he even knew so azelaic acid is that oxic acid is a dicarboxylic acid very very very effective for acne very effective for dark spots very effective for this type of rosacea so it has multi multiple benefits it really should be something you own in your medicine cabinet at home or skincare cabinet or whatever so we'll link a couple products below on the azolic acid but the ordinary makes one paula's choice makes one and atrium actually just came out with one as well that i've been testing out that i like a lot as well so as lake acid is going to be the active ingredient that you look for over the counter percentages are less than what's available prescription wise but you can still see some benefit with the with the over-the-counter options uh now one that's an interesting thought is tea tree oil so tea tree oil we talked about this occasionally because it does have some modest antibacterial anti-yeast properties um maybe some anti-mite properties it's been tested and tried against scabies they don't have scabies on your face calm down scabies and uh it also has been tested against the demodex mites a really nice study actually compared it to a lot of different products including just pure alcohol and it is concentration dependent so tea tree oil can also be an allergen it can be an irritant but it can have some benefit of getting rid of some of these mites on your skin unfortunately the stronger the better and the more likely it is to probably irritate you as well so take that with a grain of salt so it's an option so just be aware of that that if you want to look for some alternative treatments still not my favorite choice tea tree oil but it does have some benefit in this type of rosacea three is so feminist rosacea really no topical over-the-counter treatment is going to be too effective for this you're going to follow that same sort of principles where you want to avoid certain triggers but at the end of the day some of these ingredients can help niacinamide can help probably reduce the appearance of the pores and decrease oil production but overall you're going to want to get some prescription medications to try to get this under control before it gets too disfiguring yeah it's basically oil glands that continuously enlarge they just don't stop and then there's actually a late stage of this it's like a fibrotic stage where the tissue itself becomes really thick so that's something you want to if possible even get a handle on a little bit earlier so four ocular rosacea this is actually kind of a subtle thing because it can stand alone or it can be present with the other components of rosacea that we talked about it can present with recurrent styes in your eyes so those little bumps they can either be painful or not they're kind of on the eyelid margin it can present with a little scaly crustiness right where your eyelashes meet the eyelid margin or it can present pretty classically with like a gritty sensation or like a foreign body sensation it feels like you can't have sand in your eye so if you have sand in your eye but you don't and you have some of these other things you could have ocular rosacea and if you do then you're going to want to see your dermatologist or your ophthalmologist for this because it can affect your vision ultimately and also you don't really want to be putting things near your eyes that aren't safe for that area so you definitely this is the type of thing where definitely avoiding some triggers you know avoiding the sun spicy foods alcohol are going to help with this but ultimately this is going to need to be treated with prescription medications of course as always if you fail these over-the-counter options and like we said we always try to give you guys the tools to to make the best treatment decisions at home so these are some of our recommendations if these fail you then um definitely come see a dermatologist we have a ton of prescription medications for rosacea they can definitely get you going in the right direction it may take only just one or two visits try to get you going down the right path but we definitely have a lot of tools to treat rosacea but yeah remember this is highly individualized i mean we all four of these things behave differently they kind of counteract each other so things so it's a lot of trial and error like you mentioned early on to get you under control a couple sunscreen recommendations for rosacea probably my two kind of go-to ones for this are gonna be um you know my elta md uv clear which is which i'm just a big fan of contains zinc oxide this one also has niacinamide which is really good for redness so elta md uv clear and then color science has a redness correcting one it's very expensive so it does contain zinc oxide titanium dioxides it also has niacinamide that helps with the redness and lastly it contains that chromium oxides green which help to kind of balance out that color so expensive but effective option for people with redness so big topic more to come on rosacea but this is a huge topic but we get so many questions about it so we figured uh we we would put this together for you uh we hope you find it helpful please ask any questions below thank you for tuning in and thank you for your trust and support we really do appreciate it we do thank you mic drop don't do that i just bought this [Music] [Music] hey you",

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare product recommendations for persistent facial redness I know it's really frustrating to deal with I really hope this video was informative to you guys everything I mentioned will be linked in the

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "these products help me reduce my redness and texture from rosacea so if you want to do the same please keep watching hi there I'm Lydia I'm a beauty industry Insider and on my channel I talk about all things beauty and Skin Care Fertilization in today's video I'm going to give you a full review on the rosacea treatment Clinic products that helped me reduce my redness and texture from rosacea now redness and texture from rosacea are completely normal rosacea is in fact a skin condition that consists of chronic inflammation of the skin but if you want more information on rosacea it causes treatment Etc I suggest you watch this video right here after this one rosacea treatment Clinic is a clinic specialized in the treatment of rosacea as it name suggests it's located in Melbourne Australia the first thing I like about the rosacea treatment Clinic is that the first contact with them is more of a q a kind of thing where the person from the clinic asks you um some questions about your rosacea and after that they will suggest a protocol for you I have normal to dry skin I have a lot of textures and large pores and a permanent redness and the central parts of my face that is my forehead my cheeks my nose especially now with face masks and covet and my chin it's enough for me to claim that I've never seen my skin in a smooth way never ever the microscopic bumps but they are there and they so compromise my the the vision of smoothness of my skin I have been sent to routines a daytime routine and a nighttime routine for the daytime routine I start with the anti-inflammatory foaming cleanser this is a purifying and soothing cleanser against demidex and antioxidant properties it comes in this plastic tube actually it comes with two solutions solution a and solution B and you have to mix them into this plastic pump what I like about it is that you can see exactly how much you have left so it's water-based cleanser and a lot of natural extracts known for their soothing and anti-inflammatory purposes say generally the rosacea treatment Clinic makes a very good use of these natural ingredients that are non-fragrant and anti-inflammatory and have soothing properties a lot of these ingredients are in their products and that makes me really really happy because it's very rare to find normally everything that is too natural is very inflammatory on my skin cleansing is a two-step job for the rosacea treatment clinic so I follow up the anti-inflammatory foaming cleanser with the hydrating desensitizing cleansing Emulsion this is a creamy cleanser it's very gentle and and it restores hydration in your skin that's sometimes foaming cleansers can strip your skin off then I have two serums the reprieved serum pure and the hydrating serum I'm going to insert some Snippets I probably took because I finished those serums at the reprim serum pure is an anti-inflammatory serum contains glycerin better glucan and all of those ingredients that are good for storing Your Skin Barrier and the hydrating serum which I love love love loved the very elegant formula very accurate but some how really really visibly hydrating there's a lot of natural anti-inflammatory but also hydrating ingredients like aloe juice panthenol palantoin and urea chamomile extra hydrated serum I found so light but concentrate and efficient in a way I had never seen before not even with hyaluronic acid serum now the final step of my day routine is of course a moisturizer with an SPF 50. it's called desensitizing barrier fluid SPF 50. very elegant formula of SPF and moisturizer together it is very lightweight but very very hydrating I really really love this moisturizer with SPF because it makes my skin really glowy really healthy and I also believe that it helps my skin looking less textured of course in combination with the actives on other products it absolutely didn't break me out to the country I noticed that my skin had less texture and of course if you're interested in seeing other options for sunscreens that don't break your skin out remember to click on this little video right here and watch it next so let's go to the night routine because this is where the fun and efficacy happens my nighttime routine begins with the pre-cleansing emulsifier I broke the cap so sorry for the condition but this is an oily cleanser for a complete sunscreen removal and dammitax reduction and if you're only wearing sunscreen and you're not using makeup you can then apply it on your dry skin but if you're using makeup then you may need to dampen your skin don't make it wet just dampen it and massage it and you will dissolve your makeup and sunscreen all together in a very very efficient way and it follows up with the anti-inflammatory cleanser and the height reading cleanser and then we have the active part of the routine I have here the restore desensitizing serum this is a creamy serum again what I like about the packaging is that you see exactly how much you used it's made for neurological symptoms care those neurological symptoms can be for instance itch it contains glycerin corn flour extracts skull cap extract among others and then I follow it with the night longevity complex this enhances prevention and a repair chronic textural irregularities this is a very very thick and Rich cream so your skin will appear very oily no matter how much you rub it in this is a very very potent one and you don't have to mix it in with evening pure stimulus so what I do is I alternate days where I use this and the desensitizing serum and on other nights I use the even in pure stimulus and this you guys this is amazing these are little blue capsules Little Gems I I just love looking at them as well um I think this is overall the most effective product in terms of textural changes I use it I've seen the biggest changes retinaldehyde most efficient retinal derivative that you can get over the counter you do is you squeeze a little the cap and you open it up I do this and then I pull to open it up and you will see that a transparent cream wool or a transparent gel rather will come out of it what you have to do then is to smooth it over your face and neck and the following morning you will already see I'm not kidding you will already see the difference they also contain squalane so they don't dry your skin out so the whole composition is very balanced if you want to know more about ingredients for rosacea you can also subscribe for receiving my ebook which I will publish very very soon you can do so by clicking in the link in the description box dependently on what night it is this this is a last step in my nighttime routine it is the Night Repair Cream I like it just like you are liking this video so click on the like button for me and help the video spread out to other people with a rosacea that might be interested in solving their problems this cream is an advanced Medical protein refilling barrier repair that is especially good to integrate if you're going through aggressive IPS or laser treatment but also if you're using even impure stimulant now let's finish it up with my highlights low lights my highlights are these two cleansers the oily one the pre-cleansing emulsifier that removes sunscreen and makeup makeup removal is very concentrate and very effective and hydrating desensitizing cleansing Emulsion but I especially love the hydrating serum the desensitizing barrier fluid SPF 50 this is one of the best SPF I've ever tried and evening pure stimulus this is so effective you guys it's really a must-have my low lights about the rosacea treatment Clinic I think the restore desensitizen serum could be more effective in the past I've tried something with a very similar purpose even though um it was in medical grade and it was medical grade because it's not allowed to be medical grade here in Europe that I think was more had more efficacy at least for me for my case the night longevity complex is not as effective as even in pure stem pure stimulus the other low light is that this is a very costly routine every product is really really expensive and there is a weight because it's it gets shipped from Australia so at least here in Europe you have to wait a lot of time until you get your products and there are things that I like about the packaging for example seeing how much you're using of the product but also I think for for the price they could have better packaging because let me show you here for example the white part is rubbing off the name of the product is glued on this sticky paper and so it gets really messy with water so I would have appreciated for the price to have a more branded packaging to have something that not only is solid but also a little bit beautiful even if I love the minimalism and although this may be common in Australia it's nothing that we're used to here in Europe we have full ranges here now if you can afford it every two three months then go ahead for it because I really really think this is an exceptional range of products and I love that it's targeted and customized to your needs and your rosacea needs but unfortunately at least in my case I have to be with these costs I need to be very very careful of the one product that I can afford so frequently so if you don't have this budget you may want to check out this video right here where I review another routine that um it's in a lower price range or also this video right here where I have a multi-brand routine that includes also some Pharmacy products and both of them helped my rosacea and don't forget to subscribe ciao",

        "published_at": "2016-09-04T15:00:02Z",
        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi Rosie friends it's Julie and today I'm going to be talking about a rosacea treatment that I actually tried out it is a topical treatment that is meant specifically for rosacea and it is called prosacea this is the box for it and this is something that um yeah I was diagnosed with rosacea 15 or 16 years ago now and this is something that I have seen on the Shelf at the drugstore probably for the last 10 years of that and it's something that I've kind of stared at because you don't see a lot of products at the drugstore that are specific to rosacea you see anti- redness and you see a lot of eczema stuff but not a lot of stuff that actually says it is a rosacea treatment and that's what right on the box right here it says rosacea treatment and it says that it will help to treat treat redness bumps and dryness it's medicated it is a homeopathic medication it is a topical gel um and it has this little picture of this lady who has a whole big flare up and then look woo she's much better now yay anyway it says enjoy healthier looking and feeling skin and there is a whole pile of stuff to read on the back and then when you open it up there is also an entire information sheet um surprisingly a lot of this is just just about how to use it and what's in it it really doesn't say much about what you should expect using it so um I didn't know I found it really confusing because a lot of products um any of the prescription drugs and things like that that I've tried they've had things where they say um don't expect results for 8 weeks or this could take a while or something like that this one didn't say anything I didn't know whether I should be expecting results within minutes of putting it on or if this was something that should build up over time so what you get in the Box other than this um information sheet is this little tube looks like this and it contains the it's a gel I don't remember if I said that already but now you definitely know that it's a gel and the active ingredients in it are sulfur and chrys arinum um and then in Brackets it says extract from Goa powder a substance deposited in the wood of andira aroba and all of the rest of the ingredients of which there are quite a few are non-medicinal it's I've noticed it's got lactose in it Ura a whole pile of other things like that but they are considered to be non non-medicinal so that must be kind of what makes it into a gel and not necessarily what will help your skin anyway so I did use this I used it for I think 3 weeks minus one day and I finally gave up on it unfortunately I I've seen a lot of other YouTubers who have used this and who have used it with a lot of luck they've used it with um you know gentle cleansers and they put this on and they seem to be doing well with it um I used it on this side of my face only just so that I could compare the two sides and the longer I used this the more flared up my face got on this side and then this side started flaring up too and I think that could be because um I used it mostly at night and I think it could be because I lie I was lying on my pillowcase so it would sort of transfer from one side of my face to the other through my pillowcase which I changed every single day but still during the night it would swap from one side to the other so as I said I have heard of a lot of people having luck with this I just didn't happen to be one of them um I have tried a lot of products where my skin has reacted very badly to them at the beginning and then has changed its mind and has okay it stops the original freak out the original flare up and then it gradually starts to get better and better but in this case that was not it at all um it started off the first day I thought maybe this side of my face looked a little bit better than this one and then gradually over time it just got worse and worse and worse and worse until it actually reached the point that I don't know if my skin has ever been that bad before um I'll put up a picture um on the screen to show you cuz I did finally take a picture of it so that I can share it on um Facebook and Twitter CU that's where I do a lot of my sharing so um if you do actually want to join me there like feel free to follow me on Facebook and Twitter Twitter I do a lot of posts there but um yeah so I'll put up the picture that I took of of my cheek and of how completely inflamed it was and it was just covered in the uh papules and pules both of them it just it was completely inflamed and puffed out it was very uncomfortable I'll show you what the stuff looks like cuz I have a ton of it now that I don't plan to use so it is a clear gel just like that and despite the fact that on the package it says it doesn't have an offensive odor and when you first put it on your your skin it doesn't seem to smell like anything and it rubs in very nicely actually so you go like this and you rub it in and then you give it a couple of minutes maybe up to five minutes to dry and there's not much it doesn't smell great but it doesn't smell like much over time you start smelling like a rotten egg the sulfur definitely comes alive and if you sweat or if you start to the oils start being produced by your skin you get really stinky um I had my like I visited my mother a few times and I had her smell and she said she could only smell it if she got really close but the thing is it's on your own skin so you're smelling it all the time the entire time I was using this I could smell it and I used that was why I started using it mostly just overnight because I could not stand smelling like a rotten egg all all day long um just as a check back in on this it's completely dry now so it's only been like maybe 30 seconds so yeah no it it sinks in really quickly yeah so it stinks to high heaven it still stinks if you put makeup or um even a moisturizer on over top it stinks right on through so it does actually it is very good for um put if you put a moisturiz on moisturizer on top it still absorbs normally if you put makeup on top it lies normally on top it's just perfectly normal it just sinks right into the skin and it's like it's gone except but it smells horrible um yeah but unfortunately my skin did not like it my skin did not react well to it it's I'm glad that I tried it because it is something that I have wanted to try for so long now and I've been really really really curious about it but I'm so disappointed that it did that I was almost hoping that it would do nothing over actually causing it to be worse that said when I stopped using it 2 days later I was nearly back to normal it's been 3 days now so I've still got a little bit of redness on my face more than what it would normally have and I figure by you know tomorrow or the next day it'll actually be kind of back to the way that it actually was and that's just from returning to regular very gentle very highquality skin care and um I've started returning to light therapy I've started a new experiment about that I'm not going to tell you about it yet but I'm going to soon because I'm really really really excited about it but um yeah so I've started testing that out and at least so far it's bringing my skin back to normal where it normally is so let's see if it can actually improve it because I do have permanent redness and I would love for that to go away yep so that was my that was my impression of using prosacea for about 3 weeks minus one day I used it religiously it says you can use it one to three times a day I used it one to two times because I just couldn't take the smell of the rotten eggs anymore and uh I did not have dry skin from it but I did have horribly inflamed skin which is very unfortunate but have you tried proa before have any of you tried it out I hope you'll actually comment in the description below and tell me about whether or not it worked for you because I'm very very curious because I've seen some very positive reviews and I've seen some very neutral reviews I'm the first person I've seen who has actually had a a relatively negative experience with it but then like you just never know with rosacea how it's going to act um yeah so I hope you'll share that story with me um and I hope you like this video if you did please give it a big thumbs up and if you want to see more videos like this I make new videos every Sunday and Thursday other than that I will see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "[Music] to start off with so those of us in the acne rosacea domain know that the skin microbiome has been a hot topic for the last couple of years and in Balance also known as dysbiosis of the skin microbiome has been shown to contribute to inappropriate inflammation in several disease States for example in atopic dermatitis nakasuji at all recently showed that atopic germ patients have a relative deficiency of commensal staphylococcus species that can actually antagonize staph aureus causing staph aureus to overgrow and the disease state to worsen Barnard and also reported that compared to healthy controls strains of cutie bacterium acnes that were isolated from acne patients were more virulence the role of the microbiome in rosacea however is still not very well understood Demodex has been historically associated with the pathogenesis of rosacea but recent Studies have sort of been very inconclusive with regards some not showing any correlation whatsoever and also seems like a lot of literature on the imbalances in various commensal organisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rosacea but none of the evidence really seems so definitive so we were particularly interested in the commensal staphylococcal species particularly since staph epidermidis was isolated from rosacea pustules in 2011 and there's a growing body of evidence supporting the ability of commensal organisms to influence health or disease States just as an example staff hominis was shown to produce a lantibiotic that is active against staph aureus staff Luke denensis also makes a cyclic peptide that can kill staph aureus staph epidermidis has been shown also to make a phenol-soluble gamma modulin that can inhibit both staph aureus and group a strep and staff or epidermis was also shown to co-colonize with c acnes and inhibit the inflammation that the acne is caused by decreasing tlr2 production we're also interested in the behavior of C acnes as it's a well-established member of the facial skin microbiome that dominates sebaceous sites in the skin as we all know and some strains have been shown to exert a protective effect on the skin in particular sea acne prevents colonization by other microbes because it breaks sebum down into free fatty acids and short chain fatty acids which lowers the ph and suppresses the growth of bad bacteria such as MRSA and group a strep and last but not least staph epidermis and C acnes have both been noted to be prevalence in skin samples from untreated rosacea patients foreign Ivermectin commercially known as cilantro it's a safe and effective treatment for rosacea and it's been reported to decrease Demodex might burden and also increase decrease serine protease activity as well as catholicitin production and it's also been shown to be anti-inflammatory and to decrease cellular and humoral immune responses but we wonder that if some part of its therapeutic effects might have to do or might be correlated with a shift in the populations of commensal skin organisms specifically staph EPI and C acnes like how does it all tie together and so in order to explore this question that we had further we went ahead and carried out a single site 12-week open label clinical trial with 10 subjects aged 18 to 85 with papillopustular rosacea who had at least one papule and at least moderate erythema they were treated daily with topical ivermectin for three months we collected skin swabs from both legional and non-legional skin at Baseline and after treatment and then we extracted the microbial DNA and conducted ppcr to quantify the DNA abundance of each organism in the populations um and also use genospecific 16s primers in order to measure the DNA abundance and then we clinically looked at the number of papules and the assessment of erythema at each visit so 16s phylogenetic analysis of the microbiome from a selection of three of the subjects before and after treatment in lesional skin as shown here in the relative proportion of the bacterial species is represented in the different colors the yellow bars show cutie bacterium which unsurprisingly dominates facial skin the dark blue bars show staph epiderminis and the right graph in each pair here shows the species breakdown excluding C acnes just to get a greater differentiation of the non-c acne since it's so dominant but overall it does seem that seem like treatment with topical Ivermectin appears to increase the proportion of staph epidermis and then these are similar graphs as I previously explained but with the non-legional samples again there's a small increase in the proportion of staph epidermidis and some subjects after treatment and these graphs here show the absolute abundance of staph epidermidis on the left and C acnes on the right in lesional and non-legional skin before and after treatment we see a significant increase in the absolute abundance of both staph EPI and C acnes in lesional skin but not in non-legional skin further our results do corroborate that the absolute of abundance of Demodex mites decreases in both non-legional and lesional skin after Ivermectin treatment so we wondered how much of these quantitative trends that we were seeing in the DNA abundance was caused by you know just live bacteria dead bacteria like what exactly was contributing to it and so we went ahead and plated some of our skin swabs on Mannitol salt agar in order to quantify live Colony forming units and this confirm that treatment with topical Ivermectin leads to an increase in live commensal staphylococcus in both legional and non-legional skin thank you we also observed that increase in staph epidermis was associated with clinical Improvement that is the abundance of staph epidermis negatively correlated with both erythema and the number of papules on the patients in contrast we observe that a significant decrease in Demodex mites correlated with a decrease in the papules but not with an improvement in the patient's redness and then last but not least we noted that Ivermectin treatment increased the diversity of the microbiome Community as measured by the Shannon diversity index but not by the Chao richness estimator which is more based on presence of rare species and so in conclusion we found that the Ivermectin treatment increased abundance of staph epidermis and c acnes and lesional rosacea skin and also decreased abundance of Demodex mites increase in the staph epidermis I was clinically correlated with a decrease in clinical erythema and papule account whereas the decrease in Demodex mites correlated with Improvement in papule count but not with erythema diversity increased after treatment and based on these findings we thought that a treatment with topical Ivermectin may play a role in improving the symptoms of patients with papillopustular rosacea by modulating the skin microbiome Beyond just decreasing Demodex",

        "transcript": "rosacea is a condition i commonly see in clinics so in this video we're going to talk about what is rosacea how to best treat it and i'm going to offer some of my skincare tips for those of you who suffer from rosacea hi my name is dr jenny liu i'm a board certified dermatologist in minneapolis and welcome to my youtube channel so what is rosacea rosaceae is a chronic and inflammatory skin condition often characterized by skin sensitivity along with a tendency to flush and look rosy and red but also may develop pimple like bumps especially along the central face so the cheeks the nose the chin and the forehead and that is a very big definition of rosacea because we know that rosacea have various different presentations in fact we even used to categorize rosacea into four subtypes we still do for more academic purposes but for when we are seeing a patient in clinic we don't use those subcategories to really treat the patient we treat based on the clinical findings and the symptoms because we know for most individuals with rosacea they'll often have kind of a collection of various different subtypes number one is called erythrometal tylangitatic and that is the redness the flushing that we often see like the cheeks the nose the chin sometimes it can be very severe and large broken visible blood vessels can be present sometimes awareness often will flare with certain triggers and those triggers are different for everyone but common things would be heat wind cold spicy food stress chocolate caffeine all the good stuff subtype two is papular pustular rosacea so this is more than kind of what they used to call adult acne even though it's not truly acne but often gets misdiagnosed or mistaken for acne will present it is these pink zit or pimple like bumps and sometimes even pustules often on the nose the cheeks and the chin the third time is called phymatis and this has to do with chronic inflammation and over growth of your oil glands essentially often will present as more like a bulbous skin bulbous nose and that's called rhinophyma with uneven surface and texture with dilated pore like appearance but that feminist change can also be seen of the forehead as well as the chin and lastly the fourth subtype of rosacea is ocular rosacea and yes you can definitely get rosacea in your eyes often these patients will have like a dry and gritty like sensation grading the sensation in the eye sometimes eyelid margins can get crusty they can get styes and the whiteness of their eye can look more red and injected as i mentioned earlier most individuals will have a spectrum of these conditions and well being having the type 1 and type 2 so the flushing the redness along with pimples being the most common presentation that we see so why does rosacea happen you know unfortunately we are still trying to elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea so we don't completely understand it however we do know that it is very common affects 60 million americans and we often see it in like in the late 20s and 30s not so much in their kids and teenagers tends to present in adulthood now genetics do play a role in rosacea we tend to see this running in families as far as what is happening underneath the skin we do know that there are certain things that we see in rosacea patients that we don't see in individuals who don't have rosacea so number one there is a defective skin barrier and that could be a reason why often rosacea patients will complain that their skin is more sensitive either to products or to the environmental triggers there is increased interest epidermal water loss so the inability of the skin to hold on to water and tend to be more dry flaky and dehydrated we also know that there is actually a decreased amount of lipid production of the stratum corneum in rosacea patients similar there tends to be a an immunogenic so pro-inflammatory response for some reason and the inflammation will generate a cascade of reactions leading to production of enzymes that will generate inflammation but also can degrade collagen and we think that inflammation in part is what's responsible for the redness and those pimples that we see in rosacea patients furthermore there is what we call a neurogenic dysregulation so hypersensitivity along with again that clinical presentation that we see of being more sensitive to certain triggers and lastly there tends to be a hyper reaction to an organism that lives in the oil glands so there is a mite called demodex mite that we see in six percent of the normal healthy population there are these little bugs that you can actually even scrape out of the skin and put on a slide and clinic sometimes we'll do this and you can see these little prolly little critters and it's like i can't believe this just came out of my skin but in rosacea patients we found that there tends to be a higher density but not only is it the presence of these mites but we think in abnormal response to these mites is what is associated with the more popular and postular variant of rosacea now as mentioned earlier there can be common triggers for individual rosacea but one of the biggest risk factors is ultraviolet radiation we know that uv radiation is pro-inflammatory damages dna generates inflammatory response reactive estrogen cdc's and also upregulates all these inflammatory cytokines that already are pre-existing in rosacea patients that will often make that worse which is why it is super important to be doing thorough and diligent sun protection on a regular basis furthermore we know that in individuals who are more red and have dilated and broken blood vessels the sun often will make that worse so how we treat rosacea really depends on the presentation so if it's redness often lasers avoiding triggers certain prescription topicals can be helpful at temporarily reducing the amount of redness and obviously camouflaging is helpful when it comes to the papules or the pustules acne like bumps often prescription topicals and sometimes even oral medications are necessary for really severe cases i mentioned earlier oral antibiotics and sometimes even oral retinoids are used for severe cases but those overgrowth of sebaceous glands laser and certain type of procedures can be helpful next i'm going to offer some tips for general skin care and some of my personal favorite skin care products that i recommend for my rosacea patients the most important thing is if you do have rosacea is to see your dermatologist because like i said often prescription medications are really going to be helpful to help your rosacea get under control but nevertheless proper skincare is still going to be really really important and really the foundation as always you want to test out any products before using them and when it comes to skincare gentle is the way to go and less is more i recommend just a good gentle cleanser once or twice a day from cerave their hydrating cleanser vana cream facial cleanser is another really good one just find one that is going to be effective but not over strip your skin's natural oil now moisturizers are really going to be the key at helping to hydrate moisturize prevent trans epidermal water loss and really help to repair your skin barrier one of my favorite products is the one from cetaphil their redness relief night moisturizer this is very calming and soothing it contains ceramides niacinamide and shea butter and it's just a really good moisturizer and this is one of you that i have found that when my skin is like say recovering from a chemical peel and tends to be more sensitive it will not burn and has never burned my skin similarly another one that i personally love and use all the time is the two layering ultra moisturizing cream from la roche posay this is a thicker moisturizer contains glycerin thermal spring water shea butter and the neurosensing which is a peptide that they've actually done clinical studies on using this product on rosacea patients and has been found to have an anti-inflammatory and calming effects so this is one that i also really love one more moisturizer that i like especially to spot trace certain really irritated areas is the event sickle fades restorative cream and this is a zinc based zinc is really helpful for repairing skin it's used a lot in healing this is definitely kind of more white and pasty thick enough to even use on chapped lips if you need again something that can be really helpful soothing to the skin pretty thick so probably would use as needed to spot treat definitely can use it all over your face but i find that to be too a little bit too sick and heavy been occlusive and for those who want a lighter moisturizer either to use in the morning or if you have more oily skin the two that i've always recommended to my patients are one from cerave their pm facial moisturizer this is great i mean it says pm but it's lightweight it's oil free great to use under sunscreen in the morning in fact i do that sometimes as well as the laura's procedure and double facial moisturizer both of these are really helpful they're both oil free fast absorbing both contain ceramides and nice cinnamon that's gonna be helping to repair skin barrier and soothing so it's really just like a toss up i honestly love both and kind of will rotate through both of them depending on my mood now one last product that i have really been liking when my skin is just super sensitive is using an overnight sleeping mask one that i found to be really soothing and calming is the one from skin fix the redness relief overnight sleeping mask and this contains honey peptides and other calming ingredients and you wear it like a sleeping mask so you would wear it over your moisturizer and you will sleep in that it really helps to hydrate the skin repair the skin barrier and it's just very soothing and it really feels really good when you put it on your skin and it's kind of formulated for those with more sensitive red and rosacea prone skin so i would love to know if you've tried this please comment below and let me know what you think now i cannot finish off a rosacea video without talking and stressing the importance of wearing sunscreen i've talked about various types of my favorite sunscreens in my previous video and i will link some of my favorites that i think are well suited for rosacea prone skin down below in the description box but sunscreen is one of those no products that the best one is the one that you like enough that works well for your skin that you will remember and want to wear on a daily basis in general rosacea patients tend to tolerate mineral based sunscreen a little bit better just because often with this chemical sunscreen it can be more irritating and can burn but i have found a handful of mario's tissue patients including my skin that tends to be sensitive can tolerate certain types of chemical sunscreens it really all depends on the formulation here is where you have to try you want to make sure you're putting on enough most people under apply so at least a teaspoon for your head and neck reapply it throughout the day and this is really important because we do know that ultraviolet radiation come through windows and most of us because we under apply and your sunscreen gets rubbed off throughout the day that is going to make a huge difference when it comes to protecting your skin so really make sure that you are reapplying using the proper amount so those are some of my favorite skincare recommendations i hope you guys found this video helpful and let me know if you have rosacea if you have tried any of these products that i've recommended i'd love to hear what you think about them similarly if you have a holy grail product that i did not mention today comment below because i would love to try them out myself and hopefully recommend them to my patients as well if you enjoy watching this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel again you can follow me on my various social media accounts until next time thanks

        "transcript": "guys dr. devon limbaugh to the fat lady dermatologist to them we'll be talking about specific skin care so I've talked about general skin care many many videos on things like vitamin A vitamin D vitamin C at built in regard to skin however today would be more focused on how to actually treat skin or what skin care should you use if you have sensitive skin now one of the most common causes are sensitive skin is rosacea so rosacea usually affects people around the ages of 30 onwards over thirty to sixty and it can manifest in various ways including things like skin sensitivities redness flushing blushing capillaries broken capillaries a thickened skin for example new forbidden that was a nose area but most commonly you can actually manifest as pimples so much like acne - the black kids in the white kids so that's called papular pustular rosacea now for rosacea skin care has to be very active has to be precise because when we talk about skin your threshold for irritation for patients who have sensitive skin like rosacea the threshold lisa's of being this high it's way down here which means anything you use including things like sunscreens even all your vitamin a retinyl any skin care product can actually decrease that threshold to a point where you have irritation so in context of skin care let's start from the basics first of all when you use or wash use something very simple dermatologists like using things like silver fill yes we do know it contains things like propylene glycol but in the vast majority of patients that's not the problem the problem is to actually decrease the amount of irritation with your astringent for your cleansers so for example rip product recommendations first of all Cetaphil survey it makes a really good one la roche-posay has a very good range in the context of rosacea prone skin so things like tolerate or rosa lake right so that is your cleanser if you want to use a moisturizer it's very similar you want to use things which has very little in the way of active ingredients once again dermatologists like Cetaphil yeah and other products like I said include the LA roche-posay range now in the context of what actives you can use in in the recession prone skin the answer is not that easy because it's a bit of trial and error in fact there's a little bit of trial and a lot of error once you understand your skincare threshold it can actually add from there for example does it mean that rosacea patients can't use retinoids the answer is perhaps yes so what you could do is you can use a dual test spot to use a very good retinoid for example like AB IG 0.5 and you dilute that with a little bit of moisturizer so basically your concentration is lovely the pea-sized drop your pea-sized drop there mix it together instead of being 0.5 this is 0.25 the same applies if you're using something that's all 1% concentration if you mix it in equal amounts with a benign moisturizer you get half the actual amount and if you mix it accordingly you can actually titrate it right down to something like 20% of the activity so you don't have any redness burning stinging or attachment flakiness increase the dose you know send that was increased by that application increase the concentration then go from there remember everyone has a threshold right so you've got to find yours with rosacea skincare you can't afford to actually tried products because sooner or later your threshold a little decrease and you will get rip-roaring rosacea so this applies to everything I'm just giving an example with it with written but it also applies with some things like vitamin C or ascorbic acid just as a background rule most dermatologists would not advise the score big asses or anything the Civic in rosacea frame the skin the reason being is that with these formulations of good formulations of ascorbic acid the pH is somewhere between 2 to 2.5 and that's very irritating when your skin so ahead of that most of the mythologies would go let's use a bun in b3 some niacin amide because that can be inflammatory so that's the first with vitamin b3 secondly we probably advise retinol but in the very low concentration and thirdly if you must you can try some ascorbic acid but there are far more effective treatments out there if you're trying to manage your rotation skin guys I hope that is helpful for you as a dermatologist most of what I see is laser orientated yes sir when I treat rosacea it's with laser however these fundamentals yeah in regards to skincare cannot be ignored because they actually build a foundation upon which your rosacea will improve guys thanks for that attention okay look if you have rosacea please chime your thoughts in regards to what works well for you it's an interactive channel which means the more conversation we can have the more we can help I guess patients in general thanks for that guys see you next week",

        "transcript": "this is me before when i had rosacea this is me now when i don't have resistance you're now gonna tell me that rosacea is not curable this is total bs because i did it i am the powerful person that i can cure anything anything and yes i did the same thing with rosacea i had rosacea for a year and i was doing a lot of research guys when you get something going on with your health you know something is wrong and i know that there is an answer to get rid of that crap that i had in my life now i am not a doctor telling you straight away i am aesthetician i have my skincare brand and i was like what the heck is going on with my skin so i took my power it took my time i took my brain and researched and i have done a lot of research now this is what worked for me it does not mean that the same thing is going to work for you i highly highly recommend to do your own research rosacea is a chronic skin issue that is not true even though every single doctor in the world gonna tell you that this is true this is absolutely not true rosacea is not a skin issue rosacea is inflammation in your gut issue and it might be in the entire body inflammation so what happened when i started having rosacea and it came gradually not like right away one day i woke up and my skin is red it came like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly but with that i had other issues as well in my body and i'm very very good to listen to my body because i only had in the past diabetes hashimoto's surgeon i have obviously got all this crap going on with my health i overcame that everything is in remission i'm super happy or super healthy and i realized that rosacea is one of those outwomen disorders when i went to my tyra doctor i go to endocrinologist once a year because i have a history of hashimoto's i have to go keep checking my thyroid levels all the time and the rust last time when i talked to her she's like do you know rosacea is actually autoimmune disorder which nobody is actually talking about but i'm happy that my um doctor endocrinologist she's a little bit more towards on the holistic side so i started digging in um you know in all the articles research done about rosacea and there's a lot of confusing information a lot of contradictory contradiction you know against one another and this is like i was like lost and you know what when you're lost when there is information this is bad this is good this is good basically you can find the same information one article where you're gonna say this actually works and another article gonna say this is not working so what happens when you have this going on one saying one another saying another thing you actually test it and try on your body and this is what actually worked for me by the way all the medical articles everything i'm gonna put down below do your own research i highly highly recommend do your own research before you start doing what i did and so long story short rosacea is basically inflammatory disease condition that you can actually heal it or at least you can put it in remission you can become friends with that and don't be afraid it's actually curable i have situations where i cried and i thought what the heck is going on with my skin i cried i didn't want to film youtube videos i am youtuber i am influencer i am aesthetician and i own skincare brand can you believe can you imagine how much pressure i have on my shoulders i almost got depressed because i had rotation where i am representation of my brand i'm always presenting my skincare brand with my skin right i am obsessed about micro needlings their broilers and everything and i was like one day i can't do anything because main point of me is promoting my products right with having a nice skin and then i realized you know that rosacea is not the skin issue rosacea is the issue over there probiotics probiotics are good bacteria for your gut i use at this moment two different probiotics i always rotate i never use the same one i highly highly recommend to rotate any kind of supplements um probiotics or detox supplements that you taking taking at all times um again i'm telling you i am not a doctor this is what works for me don't take my recommendations seriously without doing your own research sakura might well already works very very well with candida i double this dose even you're supposed to take one pill i double i did two because when something happens rosacea is basically either some sort of pathogenic issue either you have parasites bacteria virus any kind of mold uh mercury whatever any kind of pathogens we don't know what we don't know right um studies also been uh showing that uh people with rosacea don't remember percentage but it's quite high above 70 percent people with rosacea have h pylori in gut that's mean that we have h pylori bacteria um and which is not good bacteria it can destroy our gut system and that affects our skin basically our skin is a mirror what's happening in the gut there is a correlation there is always relation your gut and the skin uh second some probiotics that i was taking this is ladybugs this is from walgreens just simply a lot of good lactobacillus different kind of bacteria i also double the dose of this so basically i was taking three to four pills of probiotics nothing is going to happen you're not going to overdose probiotics if you're taking double the dose uh this is what you want when you have a bacteria and of course this is not going to heal this is not going to cure but this has a huge impact another supplement that right now is bad on amazon and hopefully they're not going to ban my video this is not and acetylchycene nike is basically building antioxidants in your body short short version what is snack you can do your own research with a snack another product that helped me a lot i was listening to one really really great um a scientist that done a lot of research about rosacea he's like phd dermatologist he's some sort of like i had i don't remember the name i just listened to him and he mentioned this product nicotinamide riboside chloride or um this is from true niagara basically now which is strengthens our immunity basically they have fuel oxidation in the body we all have oxidative stress right we all have sort of like oxidation in the body with the age when we're aging we are not getting younger our cells is not getting younger we're getting only older and our cells age like when you look in the mirror you only see wrinkles right you you have a pain getting older 50 60 70 80 years old whatever even some people start getting sick much earlier like i started be sick at the age of 30. so i have a little bit of knowledge just to see guys i'm all about research i'm doing about research and reading book this is my favorite the health bible book the hands down this is what heal me what the hell means for those who are interested gotten psychology syndrome how god actually affects our psychological issues and any kind of issues in life oh my god guys i will go for hours and hours talking about the health how important is to actually start with him start with what you eat and stuff like this um so this one it is i think that helped me really really really a lot i started seeing differences right away and everything what i'm talking about more or less can apply not only rosacea sensitive skin acne skin any kind of other chronic skin issues and now let's go to um it's not a supplement it's actually um something that i did for myself it is colonics that helped me really really a lot and i'm not gonna go into diets you know guys i'm super super healthy i'm not eating any crap sugars dairy and gluten and stuff like this i am talking about right now about supplementations because i think that had a huge the biggest impact in my uh journey healing rosacea so colonics is a colon hydrotherapy where actually i cannot insert small footage when i did um it's basically cleaning your bowels doing like sort of like hey you can do enema at home but that's like professionally done by a colon hydrotherapist a procedure that you cleanse your bowels they put a little thing in your butthole and like basically filling up with the water and that water when it comes out it comes out all the bacteria basically this is a very natural way to detox your body i just did colonies at this amazing place thank you ladies the best the best massage and thank you for coming we appreciate you so much thank you some of you actually one person today or yesterday texted me hey jin i love your pager on instagram and stuff like this but i would like you not to post anything related with colonics i'm sorry but i'm standing for this i know it works it worked for me and if you don't like it if you never tried and you don't have any like serious health issues you can judge me as much as i want i'm standing for what worked for me and i know what for other people because i follow other people that heal themselves from chronic really chronic bad uh health issues and i'm doing myself the same thing and is helping me and if it's helping me i'm gonna stand for this stuff and i will promote this as soon as this is legal i have a right to speak up and i have a right to help people and i know some of you already thanking me and saying i i love when i receive messages hey jin thank you so much for this book remain recommendation i have at least 20 or 30 people that they say thank you jen for recommending this book they are healing i love when people can heal i love when people can feel better i just have this insane passion in my heart to help people because i know how bad feels when you're freaking sick when you're sick you don't want to do anything and when you heal you're just like you get your power back you can live it you can enjoy life i will always stand for what i believe and i believe in animal a lot something that i have not talked much and something that i was i'm gonna be honest i was kind of you know against it it's one sort of type of antibiotics that helped me with rotation i knew i had the research done the metro dinosaur i knew topically works with rosacea and i was always against any kind of antibiotic steroids something not natural to the human body but here is the thing um when you are actually loaded with a lot of oxidative stuff in your body when you have a lot of pathogens bacteria viruses and stuff like this and nothing really helps or maybe i didn't do enough then i was like you know what i'm gonna try antibiotics and funny story quick quick story actually i basically took those antibiotics not for rosacea reason i knew that metronidazole actually gel topical gel works for rosacea but i knew rosacea is actually internal so what happened actually one day i woke up and i had uh bacterial vaginosis bv and it was so bad that any kind of natural remedies didn't work for me so i went to my guy you know he's like you need metronidazole and stuff like this and you know i started taking this because when you have bacterial vaginosis you know the smell is not really pleasant and like i'm gonna do whatever it takes because i have to change my underwear five times a day and i cannot go in the public place because the smell is that bad and you know it's kind of weird sharing with you this but this is true this is what we women face every day you know in our lives and that's okay i'm no different than you right so this is what happened i started taking those antibiotics i did the research and the more i did research before i put something on my skin or on my body in my mouth i actually do research the more research i did the more i realized that metronidazole zoell at beauty is actually helping with rashes internally so it is funny story how i'm sharing actually how i got antibiotics for rosacea to cumulation heal rosacea but it wasn't kind of intentionally so sometimes you know things happen in life because it's supposed to happen and i think for example i believe that i don't know god or universe wherever you believe that sending me sometimes struggles so i can actually share with you i can overcome this the same was with hashimoto's and diabetes i can actually overcome this and i actually can share that information to you and can help some of you even if it's going to be just one person that i'm going to be helping that's a lot imagine if one person in the world and how many eight billion people if just one person helped to somebody else every day we all will make this planet a better place to live right so i hope this video helps let me know down in the comments below what helped you if you have any chronic health issue especially skin issues let me know because i'm learning so much i'm learning every day i'm learning from you and i'm so grateful to have you over here on my channel thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't

        "transcript": "if you are somebody who is suffering from rosacea right now and you have been to numerous doctors who told you that rosacea is incurable and then the only thing you can do is to try avoiding triggers in order to manage your redness forget all about this what I want you to hear right now is that rosacea is possible to be cured and you can feel like yourself again and you can have your healthy and normal and happy life back I'm somebody who had rosacea for 10 years years of my life I had my rosacea since I was 18 Till I was 28 and now I'm 29 and I didn't have any rosacea flare up for a year already these are my before and afters and I know that my skin doesn't look like a perfect photoshopped super model skin at the moment but oh my God I couldn't be in a happier place right now with the way my skin looks at the moment my skin feels so healthy and glowy to me right now comparing to what it had been during the last 10 years and today I'm going to share with you what exactly I did in order to get this skin and I'm also going to share with you all of the things that they say are supposed to help you with rosacea but they didn't do anything for me let's go welcome back my friends if if you're new on this channel my name is Anna and here I talk about beauty style and everything that can make us love our life a little bit more and please support my channel by clicking the like button down below this really helps me grow my audience and grow my channel and create more videos like this one for you and subscribe if you haven't yet of course thank you so much let's get back to our topic of rosacea and before you start your rosacea Journey please make sure that what you have is actually rosacea any dermatologist will be able to diagnose it for you we can never know why we get rosacea and we can never find out the exact reasons why rosacea starts and I don't have anybody in my family who has ever had rosacea that's why nobody could really tell me what I have and how I can get better I was feeling really miserable during the last 5 years especially the way rosacea looked for me is that I was getting redness on my face it was focused on my cheeks in this area and on my chin uh during the last two years of my rosacea I also started having it on my nose and on my forehead in here and uh it was not only redness it was also pimples like breakouts that I would cut and those pimples they were so stubborn it it's not like a normal tiny pimple that you can just squeeze out and then it's going to be healed after 2 days that is something that if you try to squeeze it nothing will change about it it will stay so there is no point of trying to do anything to it and actually I had some pimples that stayed on my face for years like for a year at least that's for sure like it didn't go away it didn't get any smaller it didn't get any bigger nothing changed about it and I was just living with those things on my face and I know how Rosa can make you feel it can make you feel like you hate your skin and you hate yourself and that's what happened to me I got to the point where I was hating myself for not doing enough for not being strong enough to deal with this problem and I would hate the fact that I felt like I had to wear makeup to just leave my house I had to wear makeup all the time because when I was not wearing my makeup I felt like I looked like a monster and that I felt embarrassed of my bare skin and the only times when I would leave my house without any makeup was to go to see a new doctor and when I was going to see a new doctor I would go without makeup and I would want this doctor to see my bare skin I would want him to see how bad it is for me and how I'm suffering uffing and I thought that this could actually make him realize that I need help and the feeling of visiting a new doctor every time was so it was hard because every time you go to a new one you are full of hope you think maybe this time it's going to be it maybe this time it's going to be a person who's going to help me and I'm finally going to be cured but the disappoint man every time after it doesn't work it was tremendous and it was so painful when you when you go out there like I remember one time I was seeing this lady and I came to her office I showed her my skin I showed her pictures of how terrible my skin looks on some days and I was I was feeling so embarrassed of of myself of my skin and everything that she said to me is that Rosa is incurable you can you can't do anything about it you can try cantra but really nothing can be done so just goodbye that was that was the moment that I've had enough and I decided that I'm going to do more and that I'm going to finally take Serious steps and deal with it so I think I've had enough talking let's get actually to the things that they say are supposed to help you but they didn't help me at all and in the end I will say what helped me in fact among of the things that doctors say are supposed to help you with rosace is dieting and avoiding certain types of food and drinks and I've tried them all I've tried not drinking alcohol not drinking coffee caffeine not drinking coffee and alcohol at the same time not eating any red fruits or vegetables not eating anything red like ketchup as well and like tomato paste anything red it was a no no for me not eating gluten not eating sugar not eating diary products I had a phases when I had to avoid all of these products completely and all of these efforts brought me nothing with dieting out of the way we are moving to probiotics and vitamins I try taking probiotics vitamins different ones didn't do a thing for me next thing is uh skincare products for rosacea skincare products which are supposed to help with rosacea are not actually helping you cure rosacea what they can do is that they can help you kind of sooth and calm down your breakouts a little bit maybe dry them out a little bit but they never really helped me deal with my breakouts completely and what skincare uh products definitely don't do is that they don't prevent new breakouts from coming so new breakouts uh and new flare ups happen anyway doesn't matter what kind of uh like gentle skin care or expensive skincare products you use but uh bad skincare products can actually make you feel worse so really be careful with the skin care that you use if you have rosace I think I will do a separate video with skincare products that I used during my rosacea years and some of them I still use right now another thing that you supposed to avoid with rosacea is sun and heat and I used sunscreen every single day and it didn't improve my situation with rosacea at all another product which I'm sure you've heard of if you have been with Rosa for quite some time already is a magic cream called santra santra is a prescription uh cream which has an active ingredient which is called E vertine and usually doctors say that that is the only rosacea treatment that can actually help you and I had enormous hopes for this cream and they say You're supposed to use it for months before you start seeing results and I've used it every single day I've used it for 3 months for 6 months for 7 months and after 9 months I I understood that I'm not having any results with cantra zero results happened for me with cantra I also tried rosex rosex cream is another prescription cream which has an active ingredient called metronidazol and I've used it at the same time as cantra I used it for 6 months not for 9 months because uh I really felt bad about this cream it is really greasy it is heavy and I felt really really bad while using it I felt like my skin was getting greasy and I felt like my breakouts are even getting bigger and I felt like I was getting more breakouts with this cream so I really didn't like the rosex cream but I kept on using it for six months I used it every night and I used and I use cantra every morning and I didn't get any results with this cre creams also I have done numerous uh blood tests I was testing my health I was trying to find out what's wrong with me I also had a sio test sibo test is a kind of a Brea breathing test uh which is concerning your gut health you are supposed to be prepared for this test like you don't eat anything but chicken with olive oil and drinking water for 2 days which was super complicated and then you're breathing for 4 hours into a special tube and then you get your results uh the full name of this test is a small intestinal bacterial over growth test and well really lots of people don't get perfect perfect results from this test so after taking this test a doctor prescribed me xifaxan xifaxan is a local antibiotic for your gut health and I've been taking xifaxan for about a month and I have seen a little bit of result after taking Caan on my face and I was quite happy about it and I felt like I was on the right track but after stopping cakan everything came back my Rosia came back fully and that was the moment that that I understood that taking antibiotics might actually be a right direction for me and I've researched the topic a lot and what I've read is that in the USA and in Europe there is um medication that is helping with rosacea and it is called orasa or eesh IA here in Europe they have different names in Europe and in the United States I managed to find a doctor who agreed with me that it's a good idea for me to take the direction of taking antibiotics EPA the way it is called here in Europe has an active ingredient of doxy it has 40 milligrams of doxy doxy is quite a strong antibiotic but 40 milligrams is not that much and what you are supposed to do is that you take eia for 3 months every single day and while this might sound scary for you antibiotics for 3 months I would say it was 100% worth it for me and I was so happy that I decided to take it the way you are supposed to take acia is you take it in the morning on an empty stomach and then you wait for 1 hour before you have breakfast that was a good schedule for me I was happy to have an 1 hour of free time before breakfast and I didn't experience any side effects with ephestia at all I felt fine the whole time my God Health was fine the whole time I was taking prebiotics and probiotics during taking aphria and after taking EPA for some time and generally I didn't experience anything bad about this about this about epia and I started seeing the results after one month and a half I started seeing that my breakouts started going away and after finishing acia I had uh like I think like two pimples on my face which was close to nothing I was beyond happy and two months after starting after stopping ecia I had zero break breakouts my face was completely clear and I read a lot online that people often get their Rosa back after stopping EPA or orasa but that didn't happen to me I didn't get any rosacea flare ups or any rosacea breakouts during the last year after I stopped aesia my skin I as I've already said is is far from perfect but I'm so happy with the way it is and I try to stick to a healthy diet I try to eat as many vegetables and fruits as possible although I know I'm far from perfect I eat meat and fish and I drink coffee each day and uh I drink alcohol really rarely but sometimes I do in small quantities I eat sugar and I eat gluten and I eat diary products and that doesn't make my skin feel any worse sometimes I know when I'm eating like a big birthday cake full of cream I know that I might get a tiny pimple the next day but that pimple does not look like the rosacea breakouts that I used to have it looks like you know a tiny little pimple that goes away after one day or two days so that that doesn't resemble rosacea breakouts at all after about 3 months after stopping etia I had three sessions of lumenis M22 treatment it is an IPL therapy intense pulse light therapy they also call it a photofacial and this treatment is supposed to improve your skin color and skin texture and that was exactly what I needed after 10 years of rosacea my skin was a little bit treed in some places the texture was not perfect I had enlarged pores and three sessions of IPL helped me really a lot I don't feel like I need to do any other sessions I don't feel like I need to do anything else to my skin I'm just going to continue with the skincare routine that I have right now and I couldn't be in a happier place than I am right now I really hope that this video was helpful for you please click the

that that is possible thank you so much for watching and I will see you soon bye",

        "transcript": "hi it's Barry welcome back to part four on my rosacea Journey I'm here now to detail and talk about sulantra the miracle cream the miracle cream for rosacea for me anyway and many many others you do your research um I've been taking it now once once a day night before bed for two weeks and it's done more in the two weeks than the metrogel did in five six weeks at all um it's it's it's it's absolutely fantastic and I from going from making my research and going on to onto YouTube reading comments forums personal stories looking at before and after I decided to then go on to WebMD and drugs.com and read lots and lots of reports there and overwhelmingly overwhelmingly I would say 90 of the people are saying this stuff has worked so so well for them initially you say it can make the symptoms worse there were some people that said that and what actually happened to me after about three days was a number of just just random spots that came I had a big big spot here and one here and one here now doing further information searching what they're looking at and saying now the experts in the field of rosacea is that potentially although I wasn't tested for its comadex mites so potentially mites that are living here under the skin we have them but in a rosacea flare-up there's there's a lot of them and if they're not treated they're not going to go away so coming to this point now is the realization that I've made why and how all those things like turmeric masks uh green tea face and yogurt masks uh even a large amount of different supplements you know they're not gonna help you really you need the medicine but there seems to be a little bit of reluctancy here in the UK uh well initially it's it's to give this stuff because it's not I don't believe it's in that quota because it's it's it's it's not the first Port of Call they go to I myself only through my own research have managed to get hold of this the doctor never said it the nurse I saw never spoke of it and um it contains an ivamactin in it which is used as actually in in the pure form as a horse to wormer so it it adds in as to why it could potentially be a source to rid of these facial mites now as I said I wasn't tested for that but what happens is uh they say is when these mites are on the verge of well going through being destroyed you can get these spots random spots which as I say I got three other people talk of that make your own informed decision I'm not saying go out and do it it's for you to do it it's for you to do that it's for you to look at all the all the comments on WebMD and places like that and drugs.com because that that's genuine they're going back five or six years and I decided to go to the pharmacy now two pharmacies near me they don't stock it so I just thought right I'll go online I will go online to it to a UK Pharmacy which I checked there's plenty of pharmacies but just do check it's on the registered UK Pharmaceuticals Council listings and it's been audited mine was you you obviously know you can buy a lot of rubbish on the internet but go to a registered one that you know is legit here in the UK it was 38 pounds plus postage um which is great unfortunately if you're in Canada in the US I'm hearing unless you're on Medicare um it can cost 600 pounds but here it came and two weeks worth two weeks and I'm where I am now it's absolutely fantastic uh I'm quite sure this is the best treatment out there for myself and if you're watching this now and you haven't done cilantro you haven't tried it just try it go to your GP ask if they're reluctant just say well I'll I've I've done my research I've watched videos on YouTube there are other videos detailing cilantro you can see on YouTube from personal accounts monetize the council people decided to tell you stuff genuine ones I've watched you have a look um that I saw as well prior and uh you know you can give it a go you know 38 pounds it's it's absolutely fantastic and this for me it hasn't it didn't burn or cause any irritation apparently it can to some people and as I say things can get better before they get worse before they get better rather but it's it's been a lifesaver and I just want to promote that so if you're watching do your research look at the sulantra if your doctor's not willing to give it you which I think is down to a money thing because it's an expensive cream um but if you do do your Google on that it's it's it's used by the NHS um for the treatment of rosacea so I have another pack already and I'm going to continue this treatment and it's just a fantastic thing to know that how how much more faded those pustules have gone and even the red some of the redness has been eliminated uh compared to what it was here look at this and this so yeah it's the creme de La Creme it's it's the big cheese it's the Big Daddy give it a go cilantro thanks for watching",

        "transcript": "let me guys get excited because this video is a long time coming I feel like it's been over a year since I did a tips for rosacea today's video I'm going to share with you guys dermatologist tips for navigating skincare choosing skincare and thanks to avoid and skincare products for people with rosacea one of my favorite skincare products for people with rosacea you guys know is Rosa care and I'm partnering with procure the maker of Rosa care on today's video so I'll talk a little bit more later in today's video on why this is a fantastic product for people with rosacea in their skincare routine if you have rosacea you already know what a challenge it can be to navigate the skincare aisle and select skincare products that do not irritate you staying burn cause excessive redness and irritation on your skin rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by hypersensitivity to things that come in contact with the skin and that hypersensitivity manifests with symptoms such as burning tingling flushes of redness heat and little red bumps that almost look like acne and pimples but are a little different in their underlying nature rosacea is an incredibly uncomfortable disease to live with so my number one tip for rosacea skin care and navigating rosacea skin care products is keep it simple keep it simple in that your routine and the products you use should not be excessive there should not be more than three products think about it rosacea is a skin disease in which things that come in contact with the skin are very likely to irritate you so reduce the number of things that you put on your skin that is my number one tip basic tenets of a skincare routine really for anybody but in particular for people with rosacea should just be three products a gentle cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen and I'll get into the details and nuances of those in a moment so that leads me into my next tip and that is cleansing your skin it is important to cleanse your skin and to select a gentle cleanser a non soap cleanser I have several videos talking about some of my favorite gentle cleansers for the face so I'll list those videos down below for you to check out things that come in contact with the skin from your environment so on the skin and can contribute to you prolonged symptoms and exacerbation of redness and irritation the way you cleanse your skin out is very important you need to do so in a gentle manner just use lukewarm water want to avoid extremes of temperature and just use your finger pads in a circular motion across the face cleansing your skin this way is important for everybody but in particular for people with rosacea because physical physical touch physical factors can also flare redness irritation and precipitate flares of your disease in other words things like spin brushes scrub brushes facial brush those harsh washcloths can be your nemesis so just use your finger pads in a gentle circular motion and then rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water my third tip is to use a moisturizer on a daily basis whether your skin is dry or oily you still really need to moisturize moisturizers hydrate the skin by trapping water onto the surface of the skin and sealing it there in place they also condition the skin cells smooth the skin cells and calm down inflammation for people with rosacea using a moisturizer is really important also because we know that in individuals who use a moisturizer along with their rosacea medications they have a better outcome to their treatment than if they don't use a moisturizer and the reason using a moisturizer is so important is that it helps just you the skin hydrate the skin reduce the likelihood of irritation and the way to apply it is to use it immediately after cleansing to damp skin so once you rinse off your cleanser in the face is still wet that is when you want to apply your moisturizer and the reason for this is that it capitalizes on the hydration status of your skin at the time of cleansing just as you wet the skin to remove that cleanser there's a lot of water on your skin so moisturizer with its ingredients will come on and we'll lock that water in place and really helped you drive hydration into your skin and see the skin and reduce irritations and doing so will reduce the severity of rosacea and we have several studies showing can improve your treatment outcomes with your prescription topical and oral medicaid rosacea medications it's a really important part of rosacea skin care now my fourth tip will come as no surprise to you all because I talked about it and any chance I get I will bring it up and that is to protect your skin from the Sun wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen rosacea patients have a challenge however in finding a sunscreen that will protect their skin without simultaneously irritating the rosacea so some tips for selecting a sunscreen are to select a physical sunscreen and what that means is that when you look at the active ingredients of the sunscreen it should say zinc oxide only or it should say zinc and titanium dioxide those should be the active ingredients these active ingredients are most well tolerated or people with rosacea they are not irritating they do not sting they do not burn on the other hand other ingredients in sunscreens that are chemical ingredients chemical filters things like oxybenzone Ava Ben's own chakra line these ingredients can really be irritating for people with rosacea these ingredients can cause a little bit of irritation to this these types and precipitate a flare so it's best to select a mineral only physical sunscreen and by that again I mean one whose active ingredient is either zinc only or the active ingredients zinc plus titanium dioxide those are most well tolerated and the sunscreen also should be labeled broad-spectrum and it should be an SPF a sun protective factor of 30 or higher in order to properly protect your skin sunscreen needs to be applied on a daily basis even when it's cloudy out this is because the ultraviolet radiation that comes from the Sun can come through the clouds it can come through your windows and can contribute to the inflammation in your skin and drive your rosacea so you need to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen on a daily basis some other tips the over choosing your sunscreen is make sure it does it's fragrance free fragrance as I'll get into later is a it can really be problematic for people with rosacea to make sure it's fragrance free look for ingredients like silicones silicones go by the name dimethicone and a few other names all lists down below for you guys to help navigate but silicones are well tolerated in moisturizers and sunscreens for people with rosacea there they tend to be lightweight they are oil-free and therefore are comfortable for people with rosacea hyaluronic acid is a humectant that will frequently be included not only in moisturizers but also in sunscreens and is also well tolerated in people with rosacea helps to hydrate the skin and in a sunscreen can really helped you combat some of the dryness that you might experience with using a mineral sunscreen they can be a little drying so those are some good ingredients to look for and some good features to look for in choosing a sunscreen check out my videos on my protection mineral sunscreens I reviewed several and again I'll list the video that I'm talking about it down below in the description box to make it easy for you guys so my this set of tips pertains to ingredients what to look for what to exclude the number one thing that you should excluding from your skincare products is fragrance I always encourage everybody to make every effort to exclude fragrance from their products to only select fragrance free products but in particular people with rosacea have to do this and the reason is twofold people with rosacea have a higher likelihood of developing something called allergic contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis happens when you become sensitized against an ingredient and then you develop a skin allergy every time you come in contact with it so they have a higher likelihood of developing an allergy to fragrance in their products and people with rosacea are also more likely to have flares of their symptoms regardless of allergy when they come in contact with fragrance why is that so well the reason is because fragrance compounds can function not only as irritants on the skin and drive inflammation but they're also things called vasodilators vasodilators make the blood vessels in her skin to dilate and bring more redness into the skin which is the opposite of what you want to do in rosacea so selecting products that are fragrance free is really important selecting a product oh it's fragrance free it's tricky to navigate because you might be duped into thinking that a product labelled unscented is safe unscented is not fragrance free when you read unscented be very careful because unscented often means the product contains fragrance and it contains a masking fragrance to hide the scent of the product so that you don't detect it with your nose but it's still there and fragrance goes by a lot of names so I will list these names down below in the description box for you guys so you know what to look for because manufacturers are not really required to disclose the inclusion of fragrance in their products I'll list those names down below for you guys so you know what or in addition to fragrance the other ingredient that you want to avoid it's kind of very similar to pregnancy is any type of essential oils lavender oil rose oil rubs hip oil any type of essential oil regardless of how it was processed and made can contain things like fragrance ingredients that while you may not detect them with your nose while they may not have an aroma to them they can still irritate and bother the skin of rosacea so avoiding products with essential oils is really important the other ingredient to avoid is the inclusion of alcohols in your skin hair products alcohols are frequently present in a lot of sunscreen will often have alcohol so you've got to look for that ingredient alcohol is also added to stabilize active ingredients in sunscreens so it's in a lot of sunscreens and for people in general you know alcohol and alcohol Danitra they're not it's not a bad ingredient it's not something to fear but for people with rosacea it definitely is something that can contribute to a flare of their disease and irritate their skin simply because it is more on the drying side and people with rosacea just don't tolerate that to the same degree as other skin types and other people with without rosacea so avoid avoid alcohol and then menthol menthol is something that has to be avoided you'll find men fell on a lot of face washes and it imparts a tingling sensation you don't want a tingles and rosacea and some other ingredients in that vein that are often out it includes things like peppermint as well which is added to make things tingle and then witch hazel I have videos talking about witch hazel and you know it can be irritating and it really can be irritating for people with rosacea the other ingredient to avoid is eucalyptus eucalyptus is frequently added as a preservative to products and but it has been reported as something that is really aggravating to people with rosacea there are some beneficial botanic ingredient so in rosacea and for rosacea care one of which includes niacinamide niacinamide is anti-inflammatory it's helpful for redness it can it can reduce the amount of redness and it also can help your skin barrier in healing and keep your skin hydrated so it is a good ingredient ceramides are also a good ingredient to consider or rosacea they are natural part of our natural lipid barrier and in moisturizers can help our skin barrier and then also licorice root extract is very helpful in rosacea skin care products because it like niacinamide can be calming out anti redness you will find licorice root in a variety of products that are labeled anti redness and kind of targeting people with rosacea so that is a good ingredient from a cosmetic perspective another ingredient to look for property in a product you look for is chromium or color correction with a green tint this helps to camouflage redness and even out skin tone very nicely the reason I like this product is they is specifically formulated for people with rosacea and they they have not included any of the common rosacea irritants there's no menthol there's no eucalyptus there's no fragrance so all the stuff I told you to avoid is not in this this contains good ingredients for rosacea including niacinamide which as I said is anti-inflammatory helpful for the skin barrier it also includes licorice root which is anti redness and thirdly it contains the color correcting chromium property so it can nicely helped you even out skin tone without masking things so it's not like a makeup or a cosmetic it simply helps to even out skin tone through that chromium these ingredients are evidence-based for rosacea so the formulation combines the wisdom of nature with the power of science to really deliver an effect product for our rosacea sufferers that takes the guesswork out of ingredients and navigating ingredient lists and in addition to those beneficial rosacea ingredients that I mentioned niacinamide licorice root extract and color correct and chromium this also is a nice rosacea friendly moisturizer in that it's got hyaluronic acid which is hydrating helps to hold on water into the skin as a humectant and has dimethicone and silicone ingredients which helped you seal in water into the skin and trap water there and prevent what's called trans epidermal water loss from the skin that could lead to dryness so this is a really nice lightweight and comfortable moisturizer to wear for people with rosacea or really honestly if you have redness in general it's also very good this product is oil-free it's not going to exacerbate and the acne clog pores it's non-comedogenic and I'm really comfortable to wear the way to use this is as a moisturizer to apply it immediately active cleansing your face to damp skin and allow it to dry you can apply it in the evening time after cleansing and then again in the morning after cleansing after after cleansing and applying this allow it to dry and then put your sunscreen on over for morning use I can buy it on amazon.com as well at CVS anyways guys that concludes the tips check the description box I will list the key features that I mentioned in today's video I hope it was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe talk to you guys tomorrow [Music] you",

        "transcript": "foreign board certified dermatologist welcome to my channel thank you so much for your support thank you for your support on Tick Tock as well we're nearing 1 million friends there thank you for the top doctor Awards Seattle met magazine and Castle Connolly it's been a great year and so I'm really excited to see what 2023 has for all of us and cheers to more fun thank you guys and today is going to be a video I might say rosacea on the title or on the thumbnail but really this is for all of those people out there with sensitive skin including myself during the winter my skin tend to be more sensitive I wouldn't say in general I have sensitive skin but skin types do flip around with the weather you know there's normal oily dry combination sensitive skin types sensitive skin though I definitely do find is something they can flip around based on the weather and definitely in the winter time where we have cold weather you have the heaters on overnight you can wake up with really dry chapped lips and I get irritation around my cheekbones where it gets pretty red and noticeable during the day and how do we hide redness what products do we reach for when we have irritated skin so it's not just for rosacea today it's for those with sensitive skin and when we have irritation a lot of times we panic and we reach for whatever's on our bathroom counter we kind of overdo it and we get into this whole vicious cycle of the redness worsening and so we're gonna go over some gentle products today that you can consider now rosacea let's talk about rosacea if you have rosacea I see this on a daily basis in clinic and it's a chronic inflammatory skin condition where you get redness on your face flushing and you can also get acne rosacea where you get these acneoform red papules or bumps on your face usually around the nose inner cheeks the chin and it flares with stress alcohol sunlight for sure heat so a hot shower taking something hot out of the oven getting that blast of hot air in your face can really trigger whether it's redness and flushing or red bumps and there are different types of rosacea like postula rosacea rhinophymodus rosacea where you get the red nose with bulbous like changes where you have really enlarged oil glands that can be tough to treat and also deep rosacea called granulomatous rosacea so they're different types of rosacea but in general when you have rosacea you're already put into the ultra sensitive bucket in 2020 I saw a lot of people with rosacea having flares of the rosacea because they were on Tick Tock and they saw a popular Korean sheet mask and so people were using it and they got really bad irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from using a sheet mask so be very careful with your new products always start one product at a time about two weeks apart and if you want to spot test on your neck or a small area of your face first I'm all for that if you have rosacea and a lot of people with rosacea can't do those anti-aging skin care ingredients we talk about including vitamin C or ascorbic acid so I always say 10 is kind of like what you're looking for for ascorbic acid going to 15 or more will really increase your risk of irritation La Roche Posay has a lower than 10 percent ascorbic acid they're C cream this is the one that has five percent ascorbic acid metal Castle side and also neurosensing which is soothing as well well especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin and the other ingredient that's notorious for causing acne rosacea flares or rosacea flares would be retinol or retinoids things I prescribed especially the stronger stuff tretino and tazeratine can irritate rosacea and a lot of my patients or rosacea we can't do chemical peels on them because their skin is so sensitive chemical peel what the acids could bring on a flare if you want to use a retinoid I would recommend an over-the-counter retinol that is less potent than the stuff I would prescribe and what can we use for that one good product I like to talk about a lot on this channel is Olay retinol retinol 24 is a nice formulation because it has glycerin it has niacinamide and I like niacinamide combined with my sunscreens cleansers moisturizers and retinol that is anti-inflammatory great for those with acne or rosacea prone skin because it also regulates sebum production and helps with inflammation so it won't clog you up and cause a flare this is a very gentle retinol I would recommend either the max or the retinol 24 plus peptide OG one without the max the max is 20 percent more of their High hydration complex which means maybe more glycerin more niacinamide I don't think it has more retinol I can't tell by the labeling on the website and they don't disclose their retinol percentage either other one that's a little bit more pricey than this because Costco has the OG in a two pack for a great price go for something more expensive like Keels I like this brand a lot this is their micro dose retinol whereas their fast relief is a higher percentage this one here is 0.2 percent and much lower strength so if you're a beginner this is a great one but you also get some additional anti-aging benefits from the peptide in this topical peptides are great because they're self-signaling and they help increase collagen production through cell signaling so I like this one a lot one pump gives you that yellow retinol pea sides amount and you just use that to your entire face so that's a really nice retinol that's gentle now if you can't tolerate any retinol another thing you can consider that's anti-aging would be Heparin sulfate containing product like sente this is nice because this also has cell signaling capabilities increase College gent this is very gentle nice for those with rosacea and they can't use a retinol this is a good option but also an expensive brand but I say worth the price very gentle one pump gives you what you need for your face it comes out as a nice moisturizing cream a little thicker texture there soothing and also effective as well so I like that brand a lot they also came out with a new pigment correction kind of a mask you leave on for 15 minutes I have to review and I'm gonna try to get my hands on to that one but that one's also like 150 bucks for that I know some of you have asked to review that when I release my melasma video so I'm going to look into the brand sentence pigment corrector mask okay now going on to daily routine besides anti-aging what can you do I say have a gentle cleanser you don't have to go crazy with exfoliants lhas ahas bhas and your cleansers I think something gentle like vanic cream vanicream's a king when it comes to sensitive skin care and so their cleanser is great I love their daily facial moisturizers awesome so affordable you can find that Target your local drugstore or online on Amazon and so it's a great brand so reliable I even use that for my kids I use that as like a body wash for my kids and you can use this as a body wash as well their facial cleansers CeraVe is a good one they're hydrating facial cleanser and the winter time is also a great pick lasts forever get the big value size at Target or online and it lasts forever now if you wanted to talk about anti-aging and moisturizers and you can't do the retinol peptide moisturizers topical peptides like we talked about have self-signaling and so we mentioned that with the Keels retinol has peptide and also I forgot to mention Olay has the pomatoil pentapeptide four peptide complex which is also anti-aging the peptide moisturizer by the inkulus just do a little pump there and you can dispense the cream skin fix is another nice brand you can get at Sephora this is their triple lipid peptide cream which is also nice that I've used quite a bit also dispense by pushing on this and gets the cream out very good for sensitive skin now if you have irritation like myself around the cheekbones and you want to sue that I'm all about petrolatum based ointments and this is a small cute mini version of what you get as a tube CeraVe healing ointment and you just put just a small amount around your cheekbones at bedtime so that you don't wake up with a red face or redness on the cheekbones and that's my routine at night but right before I go to sleep get a good fresh layer of ointment over it whether it's Vaseline Aquaphor CeraVe healing ointment I love them all if you have a lanolin alcohol sensitivity or allergy stick with Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment Aquaphor has lanolin in it but it's quite a rare sensitivity or allergy so most people tolerate Aquaphor just fine another thing you can consider would be La Roche Posay secoplast bomb B5 this one has a B5 plus because I got this in Europe when I was in Paris but this is a great product you can get at your store but it has been selling out people on Tick Tock are using this on their acne lesions because it helps with wound healing but the ingredients in this don't actively fight acne it's more for healing has glycerin panthenol shea butter very soothing doesn't irritate my skin comes out as this paste you can put a small amount around your your cheekbones here you can layer it with your Aquaphor you can put this on first in Aquaphor Vaseline or CeraVe healing women over it but you see how it comes out as like this white paste but it does rub in well and then you get this kind of dewy finish here so totally fine to plan your face not comedogenic at all I like this one a lot this is a staple in my household ever since I discovered this let's talk about the most important thing sunscreen because sunlight will trigger acne rosacea flares and it's not good for those with sensitive skin because UV radiation will break your Skin Barrier up and make you more susceptible to allergens irritants and such I've talked about ltmd UV clear quite a bit on the channel this is nice because it has niacinamide in it and I like niacinamide containing sunscreens for those with rosacea and acne prone skin because it helps with the sebum but also inflammation comes in the tinted and non-tinted form tinted is great if you have hyperpigmentation as well this has zinc oxide and oxanoxate this is about 36 to 40 bucks though for 1.7 fluid ounces if you want a dupe something cheaper there's Dermatology this brand I've also talked about on the channel this is a Universal tinted moisturizer which is the dupe of the tinted Delta MD they're both SPF 46 they both have niacinamide this one though is a little over 20 bucks so much cheaper than this one and also 1.7 fluid ounces and comes out very nice lightweight one of my favorite sunscreens out so I'll just put a little bit here just to show you that it's a lighter tint very lightweight that it won't stain the inside of your mask as readily as the other tinted sunscreens out there very soothing good for sensitive skin moisturizing as well has some hyaluronic acid to help hydrate so I like this one a lot now in terms of other sunscreens besides tint you want to hide redness because this can help how you redness pretty well these lighter tinted sunscreens you can go for a Green Tinted sunscreen like Dr jar Dr jart sico pearline they have the color correcting cream with SPF or their tiger grass camel drops with SPF 44 this one's really nice almost looks like a matcha colored sunscreen here guess I'm running out but it's a nice one it's good to have Green Tinted products when you have rosacea because the green will help mask your read very well and you don't look green you don't look like the Hulk after it rubs in really well and hides so if you get a little redness around your nose you can put that sunscreen there Dr jard is a little bit more expensive but I say it's totally worth the price you got the zika in it which is soothing anti-inflammatory zika's really taken off recently and this is like K Beauty brand especially in the K Beauty World cintella asiatica has really taken off and it's very soothing so great for those with rosacea I'd say wear your sunscreen every day reapply especially if you're Outdoors reapply every couple hours if you're gonna get sweaty or exercise jump in the pool any kind of water activity you want to reapply every 40 to 60 minutes because your sunscreen will wash off pretty readily even if it's water resistant you got to reapply quite frequently if you're indoors and you're not by any window just wear your sunscreen in the morning before leaving the household and that should last you for the day if you are by a window glass though you should be technically reapplying every couple of hours because UVA will still come through the window glass and deactivate your sunscreen within a couple of hours okay so I hope this video helpful I had a lot of fun talking to you guys again about skin care and things you can do at home before you see me because a lot of times we have to prescribe prescription topical medicines or even oral medications for acne rosacea or rosacea and sometimes even do v-beam or pulse die laser for the redness the broken blood vessels we call pelandictasias see your dermatologist to talk about how to layer your prescription medicines and what medicines could work with your skin care products because we want them to interact and cause irritation as you know like we talked about it's a chronic condition without a cure so it's an ongoing battle and sometimes it's trial and error and azelic acid might work for one person and it might not work for the other patient so taking things slow trial and error being patient and not adding too many things at once taking things one step at a time okay so please hit the like button please subscribe to the Channel please share with your friends with sensitive skin and I'll see you guys for the next video guys okay take care peace foreign",

        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more

        "published_at": "2022-02-15T20:27:00Z",
        "transcript": "today i'm going to share with you my rosacea story i'm going to tell you about the six stages i went through to totally eradicate my symptoms and if it worked for me then it could work for you too so keep watching because what have you got to lose except perhaps your rosacea [Music] doctors will tell you the cause of rosacea is unknown and that there's no cure they'll also tell you that your only option is to treat your symptoms with medications probably for the rest of your life and they'll also warn you the condition might worsen with age well i'm here to tell you that your doctor's rosacea diagnosis is no medical doctor ever cured rosacea the best they can hope for is to temporarily master symptoms using pharmaceuticals and in some persons these medical interventions can even worsen the condition over time but i'm going to take you down a very different path my journey with rosacea forced me to address all the potential causes of the condition and then to rectify those issues in a logical systematic manner first we need to jump back 15 years to a rather dark period in my life from rosetta first to hold now i'm sure that those of you who suffer from this adult skin condition will understand exactly what i'm about to say next because to put it bluntly rosacea truly is a curse it literally appears out of the blue generally taking hold within a very short period of time and it can absolutely dominate your life destroying your self-confidence in the process nowadays however i'm 100 rosacea free and i never suffer relapses to achieve this i made only a few simple changes in my life nothing difficult nothing expensive anyone can do it and i guarantee that anybody who follows my example will experience positive results so here's my story detailing exactly what i did to permanently eradicate my rosacea back in 2007 when i first noticed my initial rosacea symptoms i just assumed it was mild acne now that in itself was a little confusing because i hadn't had acne since i was a teenager and i was now 47 so i tried using various medicated face wash products and sport creams but they just seem to make things worse causing more redness and drying on my skin so at this point all i'm thinking is what the hell is this on my face and to make things worse at the time i was working as an anti-aging consultant being paid to give health advice to my clients so you can imagine how that must have looked would you take health advice from somebody with a red spotty complexion probably not and we would blame you so i stopped all acne treatments there and then and decided to focus my efforts on identifying the condition and hopefully getting the appropriate treatment well of course it didn't take long to figure out that rosacea was the most likely candidate so i thought great now i know what it is i'll simply get an appointment with my doctor and i'll have my lovely clear skin back in no time but oh how soon that feeling of confidence gets dashed i wonder how many of us have heard that we're following words uttered by our doctor or dermatologist there is no cure you're just going to have to live with it we have medications and creams that can help with your symptoms but you may need to use them for the rest of your life now i don't know about you but my first reaction was to hell with that scenario long-term antibiotics together with the regular use of chemical face creams these are not components that contribute to good health quite the opposite i thought but then reality sinks in and it dawns on you that perhaps you have no option because anything's better than walking around with this red spotty face right at this point in the diagnosis i was experiencing those unavoidable feelings of despair that hit you when you feel so utterly helpless so yes initially i followed the advice of the so-called skin specialist to the letter i took my daily antibiotics and i tried a selection of medicated rosacea face creams and the end result of six months on these meds little to no visible improvement the only thing that appeared to have any positive effect was azelaic acid cream but if i had to put a number on it then i'd say a 10 improvement in most and that dreams things like hell so ultimately all these useless meds were tossed in the bin there had to be a better solution and i was damn well going to find it so here's what i did first i put my work and social life on hold nothing was going to distract me from my goal of once again having clear skin now research was an integral part of my work in life extension so the process of finding and analyzing relevant data was second nature to me i trawl endlessly through research data documenting my findings as i went however it quickly became apparent that something vital was missing from these studies not a single one took a holistic approach to dealing with rosacea it was more a case of let's see what effect therapy a has compared to therapy b compared to placebo so irrespective of whether a study was blind double blind or whatever they were all pretty much focused on finding some magic bullet that would cure the condition that in my opinion is absolutely the wrong approach it certainly hasn't been successful so far so logic dictated that an entirely different way of treating the condition was necessary i deduced if i was going to have any chance of eradicating my rosacea then i was going to have to attack it holistically i decided to focus all my efforts in optimizing my immune system and overall health by systematically addressing every possible factor that might in some way be compromising it and worsening my symptoms now up until this point i consider myself to be extremely healthy and i assumed therefore that my immune function must be close to optimal well time to rethink that one i thought if my immune system was in such good shape then why had i been afflicted with rosacea something had to be amiss and i was going to find it and fix it whatever it took rosacea causes depression there can be no argument about that just ask anyone who's ever suffered from the condition the big problem with this though is that depression suppresses immune function therefore if i was to have any real chance of success it was paramount now i focus on being positive and upbeat this really is key so here's the mindset and attitude that i employed first i accepted that every medical condition has a cause therefore every medical condition must be treatable sure we may not always know what the cause is or the appropriate treatment but simply the fact that we both must exist was all the motivation i needed to see this thing through following a full analysis of my research data i decided that my rosacea treatment protocol was to include six separate interventions and i would only proceed to add the next intervention one science sufficient time to evaluate the results of the previous one that way i'd know exactly which treatment responsible for which benefits firstly i stopped using all skin cleansing products except for a liquid soap antenna for babies it contained no chemicals caused me zero skin irritation and it didn't dry out my skin it's actually still my product of choice to this day and for anyone that might want to try it i've left a link in the description below using only this one cleansing product resulted in a noticeable reduction in redness if i ever felt like my skin needed hydrating then i'd simply apply organic aloe vera gel which proved to be very cooling and caused me no irritation next i stopped all sun exposure now i have to admit this was a hard one for me water sports on the beach had always been an important part of my life but for now at least they were gonna have to be put on hold because anything longer than a couple of minutes in the sun was causing increased facial redness but i should mention that i did take a vitamin d3 supplement in order to compensate for the lack of sun exposure following that i was next forced to address my regular sauna use i'd always been a big fan of the sauna due to its many proven health benefits but i now find myself suffering increased facial redness for several hours following each session so the only option was to knock on the head for now but a little spoiler alert i'm very happy to tell you nowadays i can use a sauna without problems and i can even enjoy sensible sun exposure without skin issues of any kind but more on that later i'd estimate that the overall benefit of these three simple changes was around a 20 improvement although i'd attribute this mainly to less frequent flare-ups as opposed to any major reductions in the symptoms themselves obtaining quality sleep each and every night is quite simply an integral part of achieving optimal health however it's probably the most common factor that most people could improve on and i was no exception before rosacea struck my bedtime would vary between 11 pm to 2 a.m depending on my work schedule or my social plans but i'd always awaken by alarm clock each morning at 7 00 am now i knew from experience that a minimum of seven hours sleep and a maximum of eight seem to provide me with optimal energy levels and mental function throughout the day so here's what i did i immediately set a fixed bedtime of 11 pm but allowed myself to awaken naturally between 6 and 7 am each morning that way i was always sleeping for just as long as my body required sleep quality is without doubt one of the strongest factors influencing both our immune system health and our mental function so i saw this approach as vital it took me less than a week to properly adapt to my new sleep schedule and within the first month i was already feeling and seeing the benefits energy levels had increased and my positive attitude was boosted by a further reduction in symptoms if i had to put a number on it then i'd say another 10 improvement let me also mention that in order to benefit my sleep patterns i use the popular supplement melatonin and for a full explanation regarding how to properly use this supplement and how to optimize your sleep quality then please see my melatonin video elsewhere on this channel next it was time to deal with those nasty little demodex mites now for anyone who hasn't heard of them demodex mites also known as face mites are parasites that live in our face and hair follicles there's two types of dermadex mite and they're both invisible to the naked eye demidex brevis live on the skin and demodex follicularum on hair but here's where i got a shock a little bit of research confirmed that people with rosacea could have up to ten times as many demodex mice on their skin as those without the condition i also learned that the mites become most active in the dark and that they have several stages in their life cycle after meeting on the surface of the skin they apparently go back into it to lay eggs before dying within the skin's layers after death the demidex corpses become liquid and decompose inside the skin when each of these tiny mice dies they release bacteria into the skin and those bacteria trigger an immune response that causes redness and inflammation now one bacteria in particular carried by deminex has been shown to stimulate an immune response in those with rosacea so it seemed pretty obvious to me that deminex must surely be contributing to my symptoms thankfully getting rid of my demonics problem was fairly straightforward a quick search on google revealed that pretty much anyone who's heard of a demodex mite also knows that tea tree oil kills them effectively so i got straight to it i mixed tea tree oil with emu oil in a 50 50 mix for application to my eyebrows and eyelashes and for application to my face and scalp i used a 30 tea tree 70 emu oil mix this ratio caused me no skin sensitivity issues whatsoever now the reason why i chose emu oil as a carrier off for tea tree is because it's non-comedogenic so won't cause clogged pores it's also highly hypoallergenic possesses anti-inflammatory properties and can penetrate deep through the skin's layers allowing it to effectively target demodex brevis every night before bed for seven days straight i applied the appropriate mix of oil to my face scalp eyebrows and eyelashes then in the morning i just showered and washed it off i experienced visible improvements and by the end of the seven day treatment my skin looked noticeably smoother and clearer following that i added five percent tea tree oil to my liquid soap for daily use now this protocol resulted in a further 20 percent improvement in my rosacea symptoms i was definitely making good progress now with a 50 overall improvement so far reports of certain foods causing rosacea flare-ups are commonplace and a quick search on google will provide a list of the most commonly reported problematic foods now at the time i wasn't really aware of consuming anything in particular that exacerbated my own rosacea other than perhaps alcohol which i'd already cut out however i still decided to try as an experiment i selected one food group at a time and totally eliminated that food from my diet for a period of four weeks in order to gauge any improvements but nothing appeared to make any noticeable difference not until this happened i eliminated dairy within three weeks the difference was significant after two months of being dairy free i could finally see light at the end of the tunnel i'd estimate that i was now 80 free of all rosacea symptoms three months into my dairy free experiment i decided to try reintroducing cheese to see what might happen within only a few days mild symptoms were returning which only served to confirm the effect that dairy was having on my condition my dietary strategy of needing to cure rosacea was based on optimizing my nutritional intake in a way that would also optimize my gut microbiome as we now know our microbiome is often referred to as our second brain influencing everything from our thoughts to our immune system health so in addition to carrying out the food group elimination tests i also made sure to avoid all processed foods primarily selecting whole foods in as close to the original form as possible now during this past decade my diet has been leaning towards vegan but i do occasionally still eat meat fish and eggs especially eating out if i were looking to put a label in my dietary practices then i'd probably classify myself as a nutritarian eating to satisfy nutrient requirements above all else nutritional supplements had always been an important part of my personal health program and i always considered a high quality daily multivitamin to be a necessity in order to cover any dietary deficiencies however i was now being forced to look at supplements from a slightly different perspective which supplements in particular would most benefit the appearance of my skin two supplements stood out the first supplement i chose was a peripheral antioxidant called astaxanthin it's a darkly pigmented substance which is produced by a particular type of microbe microalgae and it's the reason why salmon weeds are pink astaxanthin's powerful anti-inflammatory effects can also help calm the inflammation in rosacea and it's been shown to provide a useful degree of uv protection with its natural carotenoid pigments even adding a healthy color to the skin several studies have also shown beneficial effects in relation to wrinkles and skin moisture levels now i noticed the benefits of taking the supplement within a very short period of time and it continues to take it to this day one daily four milligram capsule is all is required and if you'd like to know more about this amazing supplement then you can watch my detailed astaxanthin video elsewhere on this channel the second supplement i chose to take was iodine and here was my reasoning i learned that iodine deficiency in the developed world had increased considerably over the last 40 years and i also noted the apparent steady increase in the rate of rosacea during the same period with the condition now afflicting over 400 million adults worldwide now i knew that iodine was highly important for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland which in turn has a direct influence over the appearance of our skin but what i hadn't been aware of are two reasons why i might be iodine deficient firstly i simply might not be getting enough iodine from my diet and secondly what i was ingesting might be getting blocked by three other elements from the same mineral family those being fluoride bromide and chlorine fluoride is often added to the water supply and it's also a common additive for most toothpaste products bromide is present in pesticides it's often used as a food additive in flower and you can even find it lurking in many personal care products and chlorine well it's present in drinking water swimming pools and jacuzzis now the big problem is this chlorine bromide and fluoride all compete for the same receptors that are used in the thyroid gland to capture iodine ultimately this can inhibit thyroid hormone production with the resultant low thyroid state but here's where it gets really interesting there's actually several other tissues that absorb and utilize iodine and these tissues include the skin so if i did have an iodine deficiency it certainly wasn't going to be benefiting my rosacea condition my solution was to immediately begin supplementing with six milligrams of iodine daily which research indicated was sufficient to ensure that my thyroid and affected tissues had the necessary levels available to function correctly i also made efforts to eliminate exposure to fluoride bromide and chlorine one month into my skin supplement protocol and my condition had continued to improve i'd estimate i was now 90 rosacea free and to be honest if the texture of my skin had just been a little bit better then i've considered myself to have returned to as my pre-rosacea state however i did have one last stage to go and this final stage turned out to be exactly what i needed in order to achieve my goal the final part of my six days protocol was to eliminate any chemical toxins stored within my fat cells we're all exposed to these toxins on a daily basis through the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat even the personal care products we put on our hair and skin the problem is that over time excesses of these toxins can accumulate in our fat cells and they can include such things as endocrine disruptors carcinogens even skin irritants so i figured that irrespective of whether or not they might be affecting my rosacea condition getting rid of them could only be a good thing my research indicated that the one and only truly effective protocol for eliminating chemical toxins stored within human fat cells was a detox developed by dr george ew this protocol was used by rescue workers suffering from toxic chemical inhalation following in 9 11 attacks and it proved to be highly effective shortly after dr you tweaked the protocol for use by the general adult population and is now extremely popular with anti-aging and life extension enthusiasts now initially i was a bit apprehensive about trying this detox because it does require the use of the sauna and the last thing i wanted to experience at this point was a setback however i needn't have worried it now appeared at the extreme heat of the sauna was no longer having any negative effect whatsoever on my rosacea condition quite the opposite in fact with every sauna detox session my skin was becoming closer to 100 percent clear now i'm not going to spend time here describing doctor use detox rather i'll direct you to a detailed video i made in the subject elsewhere on this channel but what i will tell you right now is this the results of this detox with regard to your overall health and the appearance of your skin can be truly transformational to this day i still repeat doctor use sonnet detox once a month in order to prevent any further toxin build up and i still take regular saunas several times a week so that was my sixth stage rosacea protocol in a nutshell to the best of my knowledge those who have tried it have all had worthwhile results and some have even experienced a complete and permanent reversal of their symptoms fast forward to 2022 i'm still 100 rosacea free and have been for the past 12 years it appears that my skin together with those underlying factors that were causing my rosacea have now fully reverted to their pre-rosacea state but the most remarkable change for me is that sunshine saunas alcohol stress even berry appear to no longer pose any threat to my clear skin however i would point out that for health reasons i choose to rarely consume dairy or alcohol the bottom line is this if you want to effectively deal with your rosacea condition then it really does require a totally holistic approach in reality this applies not only to rosacea but to our health in general perhaps if our doctors were better educated in these facts then they wouldn't be so hasty in prescribing medications because there's generally far more effective routes to achieving good health than popping pills i really do wish you the very best of luck in dealing with your rosacea condition and i'd love to hear your comments regarding your progress in dealing with this dramatic affliction the sharing of such information can only serve to benefit us all i'm wrecker black many thanks for watching and if you enjoyed this presentation then please like subscribe and comment it really does help the channel grow
