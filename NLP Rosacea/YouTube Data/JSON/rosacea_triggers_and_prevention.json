        "transcript": "so many of you have been requesting videos on rosacea especially since i talked about it being a skin condition that i personally struggle with so i thought a good place to start is to tell you a little bit about what rosacea is and some do's and don'ts to follow if you have rosacea i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and find skincare products that work for you first of all what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic but treatable skin condition that typically involves the face now i say treatable and not curable because sometimes patients will come see me in my office expect to get a treatment regimen for three to four months for their rosacea and then never deal with it again and the reality is that rosacea is a lifelong condition and there will be times when it's flaring and there will be times when it's under really good control but the goals of rosacea management aren't to get rid of it because there's no cure but to manage it in a way where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life and where you're happy with your skin it's a persistent inflammatory skin condition meaning that it often presents with redness and irritation and i'll talk a little bit more about the signs and symptoms of rosacea in a minute but it also affects men and women the women slightly more than men and it is really a disease of adults so the onset of rosacea is usually after the age of 30. more than 16 million americans have rosacea that's about 1 in 20 people and we think that globally about 5.5 percent of the world's population also has rosacea rosacea symptoms can include easily flushing or blushing persistent facial redness visible vessels on the skin surface easily irritated skin scaly skin dry skin itchy skin it also can affect the eyes so some people will get grittiness or irritation in their eyes and the last thing is that rosacea can have pimples and so it is often misdiagnosed as acne someone with rosacea might just have one or two of those symptoms and someone might have all of the things i just listed so it really can exist on a spectrum of severity but also the presentation can vary widely from person to person one question i get all the time is why do i have rosacea what is causing it is it something that i am doing and oftentimes it's not it we know that rosacea is caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors but a lot of times people don't have full control over those and so it's not about what's causing your rosacea at that point it's more about you have rosacea what are we going to do about it and it's great that we have awesome treatments to help get rosacea under control for people and manage those signs and symptoms so they're not suffering from their skin condition on a day-to-day basis prior to just a few years ago we used to categorize people with rosacea based on kind of the main signs or symptoms that they were presenting with i'm gonna go over those four categorizations even though we don't really use those clinically anymore because i do think it helps people understand the signs and symptoms that rosacea can present with but just know we don't use those categorizations anymore because we understand that people with rosacea can kind of have overlapping symptoms that span more than one category the first of sort of these four categories of rosacea is something called erythematolangictatic rosacea and really what this means is rosacea presenting with facial redness and typically this is redness in the center of the face so the chin the cheeks the nose and the forehead and this is redness that is often present at baseline but then gets worse with flushing or blushing based on exposure to certain triggers and then with that flushing or blushing you can also have altered sensations of the skin like sensitivity stinging burning or sort of this overwhelming heat sensation the other thing that can happen with this erythematologic rosacea is the presence of telangiectasias which are dilated blood vessels that are visible on the skin surface the second prior subtype of rosacea was something called papulopustular rosacea and really this was rosacea presenting with red bumps or red pustules which are red bumps filled with pus this is the type of rosacea or a feature of rosacea that is most commonly mistaken or mistreated as acne so it's something that's important for your doctor to be able to recognize the third prior categorization of rosacea was something called thymidus rosacea also called rhinophyma when it specifically involved the nose but really this is the development of sort of a thick bumpy texture to the skin and it's not a common feature of rosacea but it's certainly something to keep an eye out for the fourth category of rosacea was ocular rosacea or rosacea involving the eye this will often present as irritation light sensitivity watering eyes a gritty sensation in the eye but like i said before we are not using these four categorizations anymore we know that people can have redness and eye symptoms or feminist features and papules and pustules so it's more about what each unique person is presenting with when we're diagnosing and treating their rosacea so let's get into the do's and don'ts of rosacea i just want to put a caveat here though that these are guidelines they are not strict rules i know i'm a physician i'm a board certified dermatologist and i'm telling you these things about rosacea but just know that everyone's skin is different and if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is fine it's no big deal but these might be things that are worth thinking about if your rosacea is not under optimal control and you're trying to figure out ways for you to intervene and make a meaningful positive difference see a dermatologist we are able to accurately diagnose and give you a treatment plan for your rosacea i cannot tell you how many times i've seen rosacea misdiagnosed as acne lupus an allergic reaction eczema seborrheic dermatitis if your face is red or bumpy or sensitive and you don't know why get the help of an expert to make sure you're treating the right thing get to know your rosacea triggers and then avoid those triggers so although we don't know all of the causes of rosacea we do know certain environmental factors make rosacea worse and they can really vary from person to person so things like sun exposure hot or cold weather stress alcohol chocolate dairy spicy foods i mean the list goes on and it really is unique to each person what i recommend is that if you're not sure what your triggers are keep a rosacea diary any time your rosacea is flaring write down what you ate what you drink and what your surrounding environment is like being more aware of your triggers and avoiding them will absolutely help your rosacea stay under better control protect your skin from the sun so wide brim hats please and then sunscreen every single day now i used to tell my rosacea patients to use mineral-based sunscreens only so those with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as the uv filters because we thought they were maybe a little bit less irritating but what i found over time is that a lot of my rosacea patients can tolerate chemical uv filters in their sunscreen just fine so rather than limiting my patients sunscreen options i let them know that it might be a little bit of trial and error to find a sunscreen that they love but once they do use it every day keep your skin well moisturized people with rosacea often will have some skin barrier disruption and be more prone to barrier disruption even if they're using gentle skin care so using a nice moisturizer that feels good on your skin that doesn't cause stinging every single day and maybe sometimes twice a day if you're feeling particularly dry will help your skin feel better and look better too and my final do is have realistic expectations of what's achievable when treating rosacea typically the goals should be to have fewer flares and have your symptoms be well managed but if your goal is to have zero evidence that you've ever had rosacea you're really likely to be disappointed and i'm not saying that to be debbie downer dermatologist over here but if you focus on incremental improvement you're much more likely to find success in your treatment and be happier for it let's get into the don'ts i feel like i have to say this one more time before i get into the don'ts which is if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is totally fine that's okay keep doing it these are not rosacea laws these are just recommendations don't overheat your skin or expose it to extreme temperatures now this can be tricky to do all of the time but we do know that really cold weather and wind as well as really hot weather and indoor heating can all flare rosacea don't rub or scrub the face so any type of physical manipulation or physical exfoliation can cause increased redness and irritation so that goes for physical exfoliants like microbeads or scrubs as well as even like the rough fibers of a towel rubbed on the face they can all cause increased irritation so pat your face dry don't aggressively massage it just be nice to your skin don't use too many products a simple skincare regimen really is best especially if you're incorporating prescription topical medications to treat your rosacea you really don't want to be layering product after product after product you also might be sensitive to certain products so doing a little patch test in front of your ear or on your jawline for several days before kind of using it all over your entire face is not a bad idea don't use certain skin care ingredients that are known to trigger rosacea not every person with rosacea is going to be sensitive to the same types of skincare ingredients but in a survey conducted by the national rosacea society there were some ingredients that more people tended to be sensitive to and those are things like alcohol witch hazel fragrance menthol peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil there are other types of skin care ingredients like tretinoin and retinoids salicylic acid glycolic acid benzoyl peroxide antioxidants and topical vitamin c and people want to know i have rosacea those things can be irritating can i use them and really it's on a case-by-case basis one thing i recommend is never introducing more than one active to your regimen at once so if you're thinking okay i want to introduce a retinoid go low and slow and kind of see how it works out for you i use tretinoin in my routine even though i have rosacea but i could not do that initially i had to get my rosacea under really good control before i could incorporate that ingredient i never want to say anything is truly off limits for my rosacea patients but just know that you have to use things like acids or exfoliators with caution and understand that even if you can't tolerate them at this point in your rosacea journey you might be able to in the future don't be afraid to use prescription medication i find that sometimes in clinic i meet resistance from patients who just want to use over-the-counter options but this is a true skin disease and i don't find that most of my patients want over-the-counter options for their other types of diseases that they have skin disease should be no different don't be afraid of the prescriptions they are really developed for the treatment of rosacea they have been well studied give them a shot and my final don't is if you have rosacea and you have not been able to get it under control don't feel hopeless okay team up with a dermatologist maybe get a second opinion and also understand that rosacea is constantly being researched we are learning more about this condition day by day and as we move forward we are going to have even better treatments and interventions to offer what tips have helped you with your rosacea put them in the comments below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see

        "published_at": "2022-05-05T13:00:03Z",
        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "if you have ocular rosacea\u00a0\nor even just regular rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 this video is for you. Rosacea can seriously\u00a0\naffect the eyelids which can lead to itchiness,\u00a0\u00a0 redness, tearing of the eyes, light\u00a0\nsensitivity and even blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0 it also frequently gets misdiagnosed as dry\u00a0\neye disease. so i dug into the research to\u00a0\u00a0 find the best ocular rosacea treatment and\u00a0\nhere's what i found. let's take a look. hello and welcome this is dr joseph allen here\u00a0\nfrom the dr eye health show if you like learning\u00a0\u00a0 about the eyes and seeing your best then hit\u00a0\nthat subscribe button so you don't miss any\u00a0\u00a0 of our future videos otherwise let's dive into the\u00a0\ntips. tip number one for ocular rosacea treatment,\u00a0\u00a0 is that of avoiding your triggers. i know this\u00a0\none sounds too simple but remember that an ounce\u00a0\u00a0 of prevention is equal to a pound of treatment.\u00a0\nbut people with all forms of rosacea are known to\u00a0\u00a0 have certain triggers, which can cause flare-ups\u00a0\nof their signs and symptoms a list of possible\u00a0\u00a0 triggers for rosacea include things such as spicy\u00a0\nfoods uv light exposure dairy products alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 exercise and emotional stress can also play a\u00a0\nrole but hot beverages and just heat in general\u00a0\u00a0 can be a trigger and then of course medications\u00a0\nand even higher doses of vitamin b6 and b12 have\u00a0\u00a0 been reported for being triggers. Now of course\u00a0\neverybody may experience different flare-ups and\u00a0\u00a0 triggers so you may have to experiment around\u00a0\nfigure out what yours are but let us know in\u00a0\u00a0 the comments some of your rosacea triggers\u00a0\nand if you found any way to help you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 it. that way you can help out somebody else who\u00a0\nmay be facing the same issue. tip number two is\u00a0\u00a0 to manage any blepharitis. by blepharitis i mean\u00a0\nany buildup of microorganisms bad skin oils and\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation of the eyelids for this daily warm\u00a0\ncompresses on the eyelids have been historically\u00a0\u00a0 recommended and also doing daily or weekly eyelid\u00a0\nscrubs with some sort of a foaming cleanser that\u00a0\u00a0 has tea tree oil in it. warm compresses can be\u00a0\nvery good for treating the oil glands of the\u00a0\u00a0 eyelid and getting the oil glands to produce\u00a0\nbetter oils but however if heat happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 one of your triggers like we just mentioned then\u00a0\nperhaps it could actually be making things worse\u00a0\u00a0 it definitely depends on a case-by-case basis but\u00a0\nif you've done warm compresses and think it makes\u00a0\u00a0 things worse definitely talk to your doctor if\u00a0\nthey think you should keep doing them. and eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 scrubs with tea tree oil are recommended because\u00a0\ntea tree oil has been found to be really good at\u00a0\u00a0 getting rid of demodex mites. a microscopic dust\u00a0\nmite that loves to live and burrow into the hair\u00a0\u00a0 follicles of your eyelashes and has been found\u00a0\nto be a major problem for people with rosacea.\u00a0\u00a0 Tip number three is that of omega-3s. now the\u00a0\nvalue of omega-3 supplements in the treatment of\u00a0\u00a0 both dry eye and ocular surface disease are highly\u00a0\ndebated in eye care but a randomized double mask\u00a0\u00a0 study from 2013 did show that patients taking 1.5\u00a0\ngrams of omega-3 supplements did show significant\u00a0\u00a0 improvement in their meibomian gland dysfunction\u00a0\nafter both one month and three months. however do\u00a0\u00a0 note that the supplement used in this study did\u00a0\nalso contain other vitamins and minerals. links\u00a0\u00a0 to this study and all references in the video\u00a0\ndescription below. tip number four control the\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation. inflammation plays a huge role in\u00a0\ndry eyes and all forms of ocular surface disease\u00a0\u00a0 including rosacea and ocular rosacea two great\u00a0\noptions that are frequently prescribed by eye\u00a0\u00a0 doctors are that of topical steroids as well as\u00a0\ntopical cyclosporine topical steroids and creams\u00a0\u00a0 are great for flare-ups but cyclosporine also has\u00a0\nshown some promise in the research and happens to\u00a0\u00a0 be safer long term but i think both options are\u00a0\ngreat to talk to your doctor about. tip number\u00a0\u00a0 five is to ask your doctor about possible oral\u00a0\nmedications which may help oral medications such\u00a0\u00a0 as doxycycline minocycline and azithromycin have\u00a0\nall shown promise in the research for treating\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea, even in select studies specifically\u00a0\nlooking at ocular rosacea. these medications work\u00a0\u00a0 by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases as well as\u00a0\ncatholocidin, a polypeptide which has been found\u00a0\u00a0 to be significant with rosacea. these medications\u00a0\ncan reduce the buildup of bacteria flora on the\u00a0\u00a0 surface of the eyelids and also can reduce\u00a0\nlipase enzymes which affects the oil quality\u00a0\u00a0 of the meibomian glands and medications such as\u00a0\ndoxycycline can inhibit matrix mattaloproteinases\u00a0\u00a0 which can play a role in preventing corneal\u00a0\nthinning which can occur on the eye in really\u00a0\u00a0 severe cases of rosacea and ocular rosacea. tip\u00a0\nnumber six for ocular rosacea treatment is to\u00a0\u00a0 consider an ipl procedure. IPL stands for intense\u00a0\npulsed light and is a procedure where light is\u00a0\u00a0 pulsed onto the eyelids which causes a coagulation\u00a0\nof the irregular blood vessels that grow there\u00a0\u00a0 which causes a reduction of inflammation and even\u00a0\ncauses liquefaction of the thickened oils of the\u00a0\u00a0 oil gland and helps those oil glands open up this\u00a0\nhelps stabilize the tear film and is not only just\u00a0\u00a0 a great option for ocular rosacea but also as a\u00a0\ndry eye treatment as well however an ipl procedure\u00a0\u00a0 may not be offered at every eye clinic and is also\u00a0\nlimited by the expense of the procedure but ipl is\u00a0\u00a0 an amazing treatment if you want to learn more\u00a0\nespecially from my personal experience having\u00a0\u00a0 the procedure done then check out our video\u00a0\nspecifically on ipl i'll put up here in the\u00a0\u00a0 youtube card as well as in the description below.\u00a0\nand tip number seven is to ask your doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 using bromonidine eye drops. while bromonidine\u00a0\neye drops have not been specifically studied for\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular Rosacea at this time, Bromonidine gels\u00a0\nand ointments have been used as a treatment\u00a0\u00a0 for regular rosacea and i have many patients who\u00a0\nfind it very beneficial especially when they're\u00a0\u00a0 having a flare-up of the redness of their eyelids\u00a0\nhowever this would be off-label and i think it's\u00a0\u00a0 really important to ask your doctor if this is\u00a0\nsomething you should be using. also a pro tip\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use Lumify or other over-the-counter\u00a0\nget the red out eye drops before seeing your\u00a0\u00a0 eye doctor because otherwise it's just going\u00a0\nto make your eyes look whiter and it'll mask\u00a0\u00a0 the signs and symptoms that your doctor's gonna\u00a0\nbe looking for to make a proper diagnosis hey if\u00a0\u00a0 you found any of these tips helpful please smash\u00a0\nthat like button for me and share this video with\u00a0\u00a0 anybody you think it may help otherwise as always\u00a0\ndefinitely talk to your local eye doctor about\u00a0\u00a0 getting a proper diagnosis and proper treatment\u00a0\nand what they think is gonna be best for you\u00a0\u00a0 also in the case of rosacea i think it's best\u00a0\nto be co-managed not just with an eye doctor but\u00a0\u00a0 also with a dermatologist or a local family\u00a0\ndoctor because a lot of the treatments and\u00a0\u00a0 medications are just things that both providers\u00a0\nshould be discussing about otherwise again\u00a0\u00a0 this is dr allen here from the doctor isle\u00a0\nshow keep an eye on it we'll see you soon",

        "transcript": "hi I'm dr. ken berry a family physician and in this short video let's talk about the rosacea diet and how to reverse the redness associated with rosacea the redness the scaling the blood vessels are embarrassing over 400 million people on the planet suffer from rosacea and I have a secret to tell you later in this video that you might not believe what if I told you that the cause of your rosacea is not some of the triggers you've been told about but it's actually your diet it's what you've been eating and it's what you've not been eating that's what's causing your rosacea that's what this video is all about now if you know someone suffering from rosacea please take a second and share this video with them so that they will know there is hope and there is a solution now definitely there is a pre a genetic predisposition to develop rosacea there's no doubt about that but a genetic predisposition does not curse you - rosacea it does not doom you or guarantee that you ever have to suffer from the symptoms of rosacea you can make changes today that will absolutely reverse the rosacea that you already have or if you're very early on in the process and you're just starting to have the flushing if you're a teenager or 20-something and you're just starting to flush and along your cheeks and nose you can stop this from progressing right now the average doctor will tell you that rosacea is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease with autoimmune features and that we don't really know what causes it anytime a doctor tells you that about a condition you can guarantee it's caused by your diet either by things you are eating or by things that you haven't been eating the triggers that you've heard about or read about or your doctor told you about hot weather cold weather sweating exercise hot liquids stress spicy foods these things do not call rosacea but if your skin is already inflamed and your immune system is already confused they can cause rosacea flare-ups but when you fix your diet that will stop happening now let me share with you a little secret about myself I have rosacea or at least I used to and you may not believe this look closely several years ago before I had discovered these dietary changes I had to use Metro gel every single day on my face and then once or twice a week I'd have to use a strong steroidal cream on my face just to keep the redness and the scaling at bay I no longer have to do that and I haven't had to do that for years now because I fixed my diet I stopped eating what mainstream media tells us we should eat and I started eating the proper human diet so how did I change my diet what did i do differently what did I and what did I add to my diet I started eating a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diets and then for the last few months I've been almost exclusively eating a fatty meat carnivore diet now I know that may sound freaky from the advice you've gotten from your doctor your nutritionist from that magazine article or newspaper article but I'm telling you this is the proper human diet and this is how it helps rosacea rosacea is very very highly associated with metabolic syndrome which is a syndrome that consists of several signs including high triglycerides high blood sugar high blood pressure having a fat belly and other things this is caused by eating too many carbohydrates causing your blood sugar to be too high crawls it causing your insulin level to be chronically too high it's also when you eat this kind of processed diet it's a very inflammatory diet so I removed all the sugars from my diet whether natural sugar or added sugar that reversed my metabolic syndrome which I used to have it also improved my rosacea I removed all of the grains from my diet I removed wheat rice oats corn amaranth millet quinoa all these things have inflammatory proteins in them to protect the seed from being eaten but when we eat those it causes inflammation sometimes it causes inflammation in the gut like irritable bowel and again rosacea is highly associated with irritable bowel symptoms and so in other words if you have metabolic syndrome you're much more likely to have rosacea if you have irritable bowel syndrome all sort of colitis Crohn's any of these things then you're much more likely to have rosacea and that's because not because one causes the other but because the inappropriate diet that you're eating that caused one also caused the other so I removed all sugars from my diet I've removed all grains from my diet I also removed all industrial vegetable oils from my diet including canola sunflower safflower soy bean peanut corn oil shortening margarine all of these things have a very inflammatory omega-6 to omega-3 ratio that causes inflammation in your gut in your body in your skin leading to the same chronic inflammation condition with autoimmune features sound familiar several studies show that increasing your omega-3 intake and increasing your zinc intake can improve rosacea symptoms well guess what a fatty meat heavy ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet is very very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc and so when I have removed all of the metabolic syndrome causing things which is basically carbohydrates and also removed all the inflammatory things in the vegetable seed oils and the other things and I added in lots of omega-3 fatty acids and zinc from eating the fatty meat my rosacea is virtually gone and I look in the mirror sometimes and I'm the way that it's just not there anymore but even as a doctor back in two thousand one two and three if you'd asked me hey Doc do you ever think you'll be able to get rid of your rosacea I would have said no that's impossible I'm just genetically doomed I have this rosacea it wasn't true for me and it's also not true for you I have an entire playlist on this YouTube channel that you can watch for free called Kido 101 it's going to pop up either here here at the end of this video watch that playlist and learn how to do Kido right Kido is cheap Kido is easy Kido is very safe very natural it's very nutritious and it's very delicious and it's going to help your rosacea get better than you ever dreamed it would be and then you can save your money that you've been wasting on co-pays with the pills and the gels and the creams and the lotions because you won't need those anymore now everyone who's already reversed their rosacea with a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet I need you to do me a favor in the comments below I need you to tell your story because there'll be people watching this video who will absolutely think I'm kooky and won't believe what I'm saying if you're a newbie to this if you're like there's no way you can reverse my rosacea with changing my diet read the comments below you'll see hundreds and hundreds of people who used to have severe rosacea who now take it use no medication for the rosacea it happened for me it

        "transcript": "now rosacea is a chronic condition which means there is no cure so treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms so in terms of treatments we do have a whole variety of what we call topical treatments such as brimwood in gel metronidazole gel which is something that I'm familiar with so for example if you presented to me with erythema which is redness of the face as well as the possible spots I'll be giving you metronidazole 0.75 gel to apply twice a day other treatments include topical Ivermectin as well as azelaic acid 0.15 percent gel which is also used for acne vulgaris but can also be used for rosacea these gels are quite effective for mild symptoms where you have your possible spots and redness of the skin as well as your dilatation of your blood vessels but you would have to use treatment for maybe between 8 to 12 weeks before you can see a resolution of your symptoms if your symptoms are quite bad we would sometimes add an alternative treatment such as an antibiotic which is taken orally such as your erythromycin Clarithromycin and your class of tetracycline such as your doxycycline or oxytetracycline and this treatment similar to your topical treatments can be used for another 8 to 12 weeks and you might find that in total use actually using this treatment for up to 16 weeks but it's quite important that you have a review of your doctor at each stage just to make sure that the treatment is working if treatment is not working then your doctor would usually refer you to a dermatologist for further treatment so doctor what can I do to help myself in terms of self-help techniques as I mentioned previously sun exposure is one of the risk factors so you might want to protect your skin by using a sun protection factor of at least 30 on your face every day try and avoid using soaps or perfumed products to wash your face as you mentioned extremes of heat or cold can worsen rosacea so you want to avoid heat or sunlight as much as possible avoid cold weather you know try and reduce your intake of alcohol avoid hot drinks whenever you can and importantly avoid stress stress is known to trigger rosacea one thing I forgot to mention which is quite important in rosacea is it can actually cause enlargement of the nose where you get this thickening and inflammation of the nose known as rhinophyma this can usually be treated with a course of Doxycycline which can be taken for up to 16 weeks if that doesn't help there is the option of laser treatment or even minor surgery now I hope you find this short talk on rosacea quite useful and please feel free to subscribe to my channel thank you",

causes it who gets it and how can we treat it well let's start by thinking about what causes rosacea and who gets it so rosacea is most common in those over 30 people in their 40s and 50s are often where rosaceous starts as more common in women than men in rosacea we think there are a few different factors that can lead to it the microbiome likely plays a big role we know that people with certain kinds of mites on their skin especially demon X mites can be predisposed to rosacea and treatments that focus on that can be effective in addition the Sun and UV radiation play a big role in the development of rosacea and this is why sun protection is so critical and then genetics have an important role to play here as well we know that rosacea is associated with inflammation and Vascular sensitivity the blood vessels being overreactive in the skin things like catholicitis ll-37 toll like receptor 2 and mast cells these inflammatory Pathways play an important role in rosacea and people who have a tendency to over activation these Pathways may be predispose to gang rosacea people who have vascular reactivity whose blood vessels are sensitive to different kinds of triggers and inflammation are also potentially more likely to get rosacea and that may be why we see rosacea as associated with other conditions that are thought to have a vascular reactivity component like migraine headaches so we've touched on what causes rosacea what about triggers for rosacea well if we think back to that underlying pathogenesis of why rosacea happens in the first place we can really think about what a lot of the key triggers of rosacea are going to be sun is a classic trigger of rosacea so we know that UV radiation is a big player in the development of race Asia so of course exposure to the sun could be a factor that could exacerbate that could make rosacea flare in addition things like alcohol spicy foods heat things that kind of open up the blood vessels can all lead to more fleshing and symptoms of radiation as well and I think that makes sense when we think back to that issue of vascular hyperreactivity that we see in rosacea and then exercise kind of along the same Pathways as another classic trigger of rosacea and finally people with rosacea skin tend to have a lot of sensitivity Skin Barrier dysfunction and many cosmeceutical products or other skin care products mean irritating so we have to be very careful and trying to pick products that are gentle and are not irritated to the skin before we get into specific treatments for the different types of rosacea let's talk about just general rosacea skin care that's going to apply to any kind of rosacea so we talked about how important UV radiation is into causing rosacea so everybody with rosacea really should be using a good sunscreen daily at least SPF 30 to 50. sometimes if that sunscreen has other ingredients in it like niacinamide that can help calm the skin that can be helpful as well Beyond sunscreen we also want to make sure we're helping the Skin Barrier so using a good moisturizer daily often things that hyaluronic acid can feel really nice on the skin or things with some niacinamide can help in rosacea your prone skin as well so that's another critical part of General rosacea skin care and then finally being thoughtful about your own personal triggers we talked about some of the triggers for rosacea if you notice that certain things flare your rosacea being thoughtful about how can I avoid those triggers or reduce them especially when I don't want to be experiencing the symptoms of rosacea can be helpful as well when we think about classifying rosacea it really falls into three main types there's redness and flushing there's bumps papules and pustules and then there's a growth on the nose called biminous changes and you can have any mixture of these three types some people have just one some people have all three together and this is really important to understand your rosacea type because certain treatments work well for one thing but not well for the other let's start with redness and flushing so what's going on here is we have that vascular hyperreactivity those blood vessels are dilated they're too open there's too much blood flow to the skin and so the skin starts to get a red appearance and sometimes with burning and stinging so if we want to treat this we need to either get rid of those blood vessels or we need to help them calm down in terms of getting rid of them that's where our vascular lasers can be helpful so post-diser KTP laser or other energy-based devices like intense pulse light can be helpful to selectively Target those overreactive blood vessels in the skin those fixed talangectages as broken blood vessels on the skin to get rid of them so that's one of our effective treatments these can often give a durable Improvement where you do several sessions of treatment and that redness in those two languages are durably last for a period of time often many years we also can try to physically destroy some of those Challenger tasers those broken blood vessels on the skin using a technique called electrodesication or sclerotherapy where we physically destroy them on the medication side of things there are two creams one's called oxymetazoline and one's called bramonidine they both work the same way the general idea here is if we can tell those overreactive blood vessels that squeeze down to clamp down we will reduce blood flow to the skin and we can reduce that fleshing and Vascular hyperreactivity both of these can give a temporary Improvement in redness in general oxymetazoline I would say is preferable because it doesn't seem to cause rebound so with bramonidine sometimes is that eight to ten hours of redness reduction wears off there can be a brief period where the redness is actually worse than where it started and fortunately we don't see this with oxymetazoline the other thing we've noticed in the clinical trials of these treatments is that if you do them consistently it seems like it may teach the blood vessels to be less reactive and cause actually a permanent or a durable decrease in redness in addition to that transient temporary effect for more severe redness or flushing we can use beta blockers so pills by mouth that again try to help tell those blood vessels to calm down to be less overreactive and for patients with really severe fleshing or burning or singing they can be very valuable treatments moving on to the bumps of papules and pustules of rosacea this is where often our treatments are directed at the microbiome at the skin microorganisms that we know can contribute to rosacea metronidazole is our classic topical treatment for rosacea papules and pustules and it works very well however there are some newer treatments like Ivermectin that have been shown in head-to-head trials for better than metronidazole for treating the bumps of rosacea there's also now a benzoyl peroxide that we can use to treat rosacea classically we've tried to avoid benzyl peroxide and rosacea because it can be irritating and people with rosacea prone skin tend to have very sensitive skin and have trouble with benzoyl peroxide but if we encapsulate that benzoyl peroxide we micro encapsulated that causes it to be released more slowly onto the skin and these micro encapsulate benzyl peroxides in clinical trials seem Not to cause irritation for people on rosacea prone skin and can help treat those bumps those papules and pustules we also have washes like sulfur washes that can be helpful and for for some more severe bumps for more severe patches and postures that aren't responding to topical treatments that's where some of our systemic medications like oral antibiotics or like isotradino and Accutane can help with these bumps and then finally moving on to five minutes changes these gross on the nose where the nose becomes thicker and full of the sebaceous tissue here often we need to use either pill treatments like oral antibiotics like doxycycline or Minocycline or isotradone because it can be very difficult to treat these feminist changes with topical therapies and for some where these sinus changes have really progressed and become disfiguring we can use surgical treatments to help try to correct the appearance of the skin and to undo the damage from these feminist changes so thanks for watching I hope you found this video helpful for more acting rosacea content check out our Channel and if you found this useful

        "transcript": "hi everyone welcome back to another lesson this lesson is on rosacea so we're going to talk about some of the potential causes of this condition we're also going to talk about some of the triggers the signs and symptoms so we're going to get into some of the specific skin lesions that can occur with rosace then we're going to talk about how it's diagnosed and how it's treated so rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition involving recurrent episodes of skin lesions on the face we're going to get into more detail as to these exact skin lesions later on in this lesson rosacea is an autoimmune condition which means that it is the patient's own immune system that attacks its own cells and tissues to cause a lot of these signs and symptoms now although this is known to be an autoimmune condition the pathophysiology is not entirely understood but we're going to talk about some of the known pathophysiology later on in this lesson and rosace may be associated with other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease like ulcer of cius and Crohn's disease and cardiovascular diseases and neurologic diseases and rosacea is estimated to affect at least 5% of the general population which means that it is is a relatively common condition and it is more likely to affect certain ethnic groups particularly those with Celtic Heritage those individuals with Celtic Heritage have a higher likelihood of having rosacea compared to other populations and this condition affects individuals between the ages of 30 to 50 most often now let's talk about some of the potential causes of rosace so although the causes are not entirely known it's believed that genetics are involved we talked about some of those ethnic groups that are at higher likelihood of having rosace so genetics are likely involved in rosace now some other potential causes of rosace include Demodex mites Demodex mites are these microscopic hair follicle mites and it's been shown that when looking at lesions of patients who have rosacea their lesions contain high levels of these Demodex mites so there does seem to be an association between high levels of these Demodex mites or these hair follicle mites and rosacea and there has been another potential cause that has been noted and this is an infection with helicobactor poori or hpylori this is a gram negative bacteria that can cause an infection in the stomach so there does seem to be an association between an infection with H pylori and the onset of rosacea as well there has also been some association with exposure to ultraviolet or UV rays this may be more of a trigger and we're going to talk about triggers of skin lesions later on in this lesson so this may be more of a trigger of Ros not the exact cause and then certain medic have also been noted to either cause rosacea or trigger an underlying rosace some of these medications include steroids and some blood pressure medications now let's talk about some of the pathophysiology behind why rosacea occurs so it all has to do with disregulation of the innate and adaptive immune functioning and vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels so vasod dilation would be dilation of blood vessels so these are the two main categories of mechanisms and the reason why these may occur why disregulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning may occur includes increased expression or overexpression of tole like receptor 2 which is a cell receptor involved in annate and adaptive immune functioning so overexpression and overactivation of this receptor seems to be part of the pathophysiology in rosacea and with regards to the vasod dilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels there seems to be an increased release of vasoactive peptides so increased release of vasoactive peptides has been noted in patients with rosacea and patients with rosacea also seem to have higher levels of other particular receptors including increased or overexpression of transient receptor potential vanilloid one or trpv1 receptor and increased expression of trpa1 or transient receptor potential anchor in one receptor and there's some other receptors as well and each of these receptors seems to Al Al be associated with some of the triggers we're going to talk about later on in this lesson so some of these are involved in heat and cold Sensation that can cause changes to vasil regulation so we're going to talk a bit more about this later on in this lesson as well so some of these receptors can be involved in why certain things trigger the onset of skin lesions in rosacea but there also seems to be some interplay with having Demodex mites or infestation of Demodex mites and an infection with H pylori which seem to also increase some of the activation of some of these receptors and release of vasoactive peptides in some patients so again not all of the pathophysiology is known but these are some of the known factors in rosacea now there are several subtypes of rosacea that cause different clinical presentations one subtype is known as aromatic this subtype is more commonly going to be the initial presentation of rosacea another one is papulo postular this one can appear like acne and often times will occur later on in life so it can often times be termed as adult acne there is also a subtype known as fattis subtype and there's also one that is known as ocular subtype which affects the eyes and we're going to talk about all the clinical signs and symptoms of each of these subtypes later on in this lesson now it's important to make note of the fact that individuals can have features of different subtypes they can have some features of multiple subtypes and the subtypes may change over time they may be more likely to have aromatic subtype and then they may be more likely to have fattis subtype later on in their life now before we talk about the skin lesions let's talk about where they affect the face often times it's going to affect the forehead the nose and upper cheeks and the chin these are going to be common areas where we see a lot of the lesions we're going to talk about in this lesson and often times are going to be symmetric so if you see it on one side if you see it on the patient's right side you're also going to see it on the patient's left side so they're often times going to be symmetric and in these locations now let's actually talk about the clinical features of rosacea so with regards to the athato telen acatic subtype we see tasas tasas are these small dilated blood vessels that are often termed as spider veins so we can see these on the face in those areas we talked about before this is often times going to be more noted in older age we can also see Etha which is a reing of the skin this can be transient or non-transient so transient being that it can come and go away so it's temporary or it can be non-transient meaning that it can be permanent So the patient's face can become very rened and often times this is going to affect younger age groups this again is going to be part of the arithat telic tatic subtype and we can also see flushing in some patients so flushing is going to again be a transient reing of the face and it's often times going to occur in younger age groups now with regards to the papulopustular subtype of rosacea that we talked about before this is going to lead to papules so papules are these inflammatory raised skin lesions and we can also see pules so pules are also inflammatory but they are pus filled so they can often times be mistaken for acne and often times be termed as adult acne or acne rosacea but is not actually the same condition as acne because there are no comedones if you want more information on acne please check out my full lesson on that topic but suffice to say with the skin lesions in rosacea the way to distinguish these papules and postul from actually having acne vulgaris there are no comedones and often times a patient's going to have an episode of these clinical features and then they're going to go into remission and then they're going to go into another episode so there's often times going to be periods where they have an episode of skin lesions that go into remission and then something triggers them to also have another episode so there's often times going to be a pattern of episode and remission of these skin lesions some other clinical features that can be noted with these skin lesions include burning sensation from the lesions a tingling sensation from the lesions a stinging sensation can also be noted and then puitis which is an itching sensation so often times these are going to be some of the other clinical features that can be noted from these skin lesions as well let's talk about the ocular form of this condition so the ocular form of rosacea actually affects a majority of patients that actually get rosacea so 50 to 75% of patients will have eye involvement and often times what's going to be noted with ocular rosacea is that patients have issues with dryness of their eyes redness of their eyes or tearing they can often have blurred vision or light sensitivity and some more specific findings can be blefaritis which is an inflammation of the eyelids conjunctivitis which is an inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eyes keratitis which is an inflammation of the corne of the eye and iritis which is an inflammation of the iris of the eye so all of these can be noted in patients with rosacea as well and again it can affect 50 to 75% of patients who have rosacea and some patients can have another Finding known as a rinofima rinofima is an enlargement of the nose so this enlargement of the nose is due to hyperplasia of sebaceous glands so these sebaceous glands become enlarged and lead to an enlargement of the nose and this can often be due to chronic long-standing untreated rosacea so if there is long-standing untreated rosacea it can lead to this rinofima and what is noted with rhop is that almost all cases of rinofima occur in males it is very rare in female patients so again this is another clinical presentation of rosacea that can be found and rinofima would be under the classification of the fattis subtype of rosacea now let's talk about some of the triggering or exacerbating factors we talked about some of the potential triggers that can cause or increase the likelihood of having skin lesions from rosacea some of these include stress so stress can trigger rosacea skin lesions consumption of caffeine can also trigger the onset of skin lesions alcohol can also trigger skin lesions as well and consumption of hot liquids can trigger or worsen skin lesions in rosacea some other exacer factors include eating certain spices so certain very spicy foods can actually trigger the onset of skin lesions in rosacea we talked about some of those receptors when we talked about the pathophysiology of rosacea and a lot of them can be triggered by certain spices so capsacin in some very spicy foods can actually trigger and activate some of those receptors significant temperature changes so going from very hot to very cold that can also trigger skin lesions as well sunlight exposure we talked about UV light potentially being a cause but it's more likely to be an exacerbating factor and then wind exposure so wind hitting the face especially with significant changes in temperature this can also exacerbate or trigger skin lesions in rosacea as well so how do clinicians diagnose and treat rosacea the diagnosis of rosacea is often times going to be a clinical diagnosis so looking at the history and physical examination and getting some of those triggers we talked about before this is going to be enough to make the diagnosis for clinicians now with regards to how clinicians treat rosacea oftentimes they're going to break it down into categories of treatments so there's going to be lifestyle treatments so it's important to avoid exacerbating and triggering factors we talked about those in the last slide and gentle cleansing with moisturizers can also be helpful for some of those skin lesions and then sun protection so photo protection using sunscreen with at least an SPF of 30 can be helpful and the rest of the treatments are going to be more tailored to the specific spefic type of rosacea so with regards to ocular rosacea artificial tears can be helpful and metronidazol eye drops can also be helpful with regards to Emma so that reing of the skin of the face rodine tartrate gel can be helpful and oxymetazoline hydrochloride gel can also be helpful with regards to inflammatory lesions on the face these include tetracyclin and aiyin and topical metronidazol topical zic acid and icin cream to treat those Dem mites can also be helpful as well and with regards to issues with flushing in rosacea some clinicians may use propanolol or corvalol and laser therapy laser therapy can be helpful for the flushing in rosace in clinici can often treat the fima or the rinofima with doxycyclin isotretinoin and tetracyclin when it is in the inflammatory stage of the Rhino but when it's in the non-inflammatory stage when it has become enlarged in permanent surgical resection may be required and laser surgery can also be helpful in reducing the Rhino fima so if you want to learn more about other Dermatology

        "published_at": "2021-04-08T14:18:13Z",
        "transcript": "are you one of the ten percent who's prone to a long blush or even a flush or are you getting spots here that are different to acne type spots or maybe you're someone who's got skin that just looks red all the time and it's super sensitive especially to skin care well you might have rosacea now april is rosacea awareness month so today i wanted to go deep in this common and distressing condition so you have all the information you need to determine if you've got it how to treat it how to choose skin care and what not to do now i'm speaking as somebody who's prone to rosacea myself it kicked in around the age of 30. i suddenly noticed that a glass of red wine my favorite made me redder for longer than all my friends i don't want any photographs taken after a certain time in the evening um i didn't really tend to get spottiness as such and i was definitely sensitive to ill-chosen skin care choices um so i would have to be very careful about what i used on my skin um so if any of that resonates with you then do keep watching because we're going to go into this in a bit more detail but the good news is there's loads that can be done with the right choices of skin care with finding the right treatment to manage your type of rosacea but the key in the first instance is to know what kind of rosacea you have so let's get into that so there are four different types of rosacea now the one that we all know commonly i think is the papulo pustulotype which is often mislabeled as acne rosacea because of the presence of spots red bumps and red bumps with white heads of papules and pustules but there are some key differences to distinguish rosacea from acne the time acne is really a misnomer so the key thing really is that there are no comedones as part of the rosacea process now what can be confusing is that people rosacea can sometimes be also prone to acne but the distribution tends to be different so typically with rosacea we're talking about mid-face disease and the spots themselves have a different quality they're what we call dome shape so the tops are rounded where acne spots tend to be more prone to pointing so that's really key so no comedones and any sort of different shape lesions in a different distribution adult acne is typically in the u of the face teen acne in the t zone so that's type 2 rosacea now type 1 is what we call erythema telangiectatic rosacea so that's a bit of a mouthful but basically it means redness and broken vessels so that's someone who probably doesn't get the spotty aspect but it's just constantly a bit red on the cheeks or the nose and when you peer closely we'll have little broken vessels broken capillaries and they have this pronounced flushing then the third type is phymatus rosacea where basically the ongoing inflammatory process activates fibrosis and thickening of the skin and that's typically seen over the nose something we call rhinophyma now it's rare and it's more common in men but it is an important type to recognize we want to really prevent that type of rosacea and then the final type is ocular rosacea so rosacea's disorder that can affect the eyes and the eyelids so you tend to see reddening and injection along the lid margins and it can occur with conditions like blepharitis as well but someone will typically describe their eyes as being dry gritty um a feeling of discomfort and that's a common manifestation of rosacea it's one that's often missed now one of the hallmarks of rosacea aside from those physical findings is the description of discomfort of the skin so burning and stinging especially in association with skin care and we know that people with rosacea are prone to barrier dysfunction so this is something that practically can really cause problems difficulty using skin care products finding a suitable sunscreen everything burning or stinging when applied to the skin now that is a big and common trigger especially for women but additional triggers exist as well and it really is important to get to know your rosacea and know what your triggers are for some people winter cold weather low humidity will be a real aggravate um we know we've already got barrier dysfunction but that low humidity cold air chafing with winds and things can really make the skin even drier and more sensitive on the other hand there's a group where sunshine and uv is a big part of it and we know that uv is probably a big part in the whole ideology of rosacea it tends to happen in fair-skinned individuals as we said but summer can be particularly troublesome and you factor in sunscreen problems it can often get really quite stressful as i mentioned before what you consume can have a big impact so for me as i said red wine and that's common because red wine not only um is a vasodilator from the point of view of having alcohol in it but it's also histamine releasing which can be a double whammy for redness prone skin but all types of alcohol can make the skin more prone to flushing as can spicy foods hot caffeinated beverages so really be conscious of what you're eating and how that plays into where your skin behaves other things to think about is environmental things so you know i tend not to recommend saunas to my patients we have a disorder that's characterized by broken vessels by vessels opening up in response to the environment and staying open for longer we don't want to promote that by going into a hot environment for long periods of time similarly be conscious of your room temperature where you're working you might well find that a cooler room suits you better it certainly does for me so why does rosacea happen in the first place there's lots of different theories and it's not fully yet understood but the main philosophy that we adopt nowadays is the understanding of the innate inflammatory system in the skin and how it goes wrong and causing rosacea so it's thought to be uv triggered as i mentioned but in those who are genetically predisposed and what the key finding is is the presence of something called catholicidine which is an inflammatory mediator that we're seeing in the skin in response to environmental stressors like sunshine and it's abnormally processed in rosacea and it tends to cause a whole cascade of inflammatory mediators that are released into the skin that attracts something called neutrophils which are a type of white blood cell that really kickstarts the whole process leading to ongoing inflammation that leads to these changes involving the tissues both in terms of the dermis and its structure and the blood vessels so the innate immune system is there to protect us but it's overly sensitive when you have rosacea so i've always likened it to the smoke alarm going off whenever the kettle boils rather than when the oven is on fire so it's misbehaving and the the red alert is going off too soon so when it comes to managing rosacea i think it's very important to look at your approach to your skin holistically so it's not just about what you use in terms of the treatment elements it's about the skin care approach that you adopt too and there are some important steps i think that are worth considering so with rosacea the most important thing is simplicity now i know that simplicity is something i'm i'm an advocate of you know in in all situations really but never more so than in rosacea so i think that we know that biodysfunction is a big part of what goes wrong with the skin so it's really important that what you do does not additionally deplete the skin barrier so the first thing to look at is your cleansing no double cleansing keep it gentle non-foaming i tend to recommend non-clogging as well stick to a single cleanse and use tepid not hot water and when you're patting your skin dye do so very gently it's really important that you do no harm with your cleanse then as part of a barrier repair approach seek out a moisturizer that offers that so not just something with humectants hyaluronic acid really won't do you much good when it comes to rosacea you want nice occlusives you want barrier repair ingredients like ceramides and niacinamide if your skin can tolerate it to help really ensure that barrier stays nice and robust sunscreen with rosacea is really important to give you that uv protection and actually it's amazing how patients really do start to appreciate how important daily sunscreen is all year round with their skin but i find that the best tolerated sunscreens are those that are all minerals so containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to give broad spectrum cover but nice gentle filters that won't tend to irritate skin now moving on to treatments for rosacea so i think it's really important to make sure that that's what you've got in the first instance i mean usually it's pretty straightforward if you've got the symptoms and the signs that i've described but if you're in any doubt do go and see your doctor get referred to a dermatologist to be sure that's what you have and then really you will find that prescription creams do work best when it comes to managing rosacea at least in the first instance i think it's relatively rare particularly with the papillary posterior type you'll get a handle on it with just over-the-counter products so things that might get used in the first instance um antibiotics such as metronidazole and that comes in the form of metro gel or rosex cream i have to say that i've moved away from using this as much in my practice but it's still one of the standard treatments that um that you'll find being used additional treatments might include sulantra or ivamectin which targets the might in the skin demodex possibly due to the effect against demidex mites but possibly just due to an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin as we see with antibiotics it's really not about targeting a bacteria as far as we can see it's about the anti-inflammatory effects that these products have on the skin hence the benefits of azelaic acid which is not targeting a particular organism it's targeting this innate immune system malfunction so those are the three that tend to be used in context of acutely active rosacea now if the skin is particularly active and usually again we're talking about the papillary pasteurity we'll use oral tetracyclines now again we're using them for their anti-inflammatory effect tetracyclines lower the activity of matrix metallic proteinase enzymes in the skin which are part and parcel of what generates this inflammatory amelia with increased catholicism abnormal processing of catalyst in the skin so we can use them at lower doses than we would when we're trying to treat bacterial infections which is good news because any treatment for rosacea is likely to be needed for at least six if not 12 weeks and sometimes beyond that sometimes we need to keep people on long-term therapy it's a disease that's chronic tends to relapse and remit and for some people it just plods on and needs ongoing treatment but you know we're seeing a condition here where we're using drugs that have antibacterial properties but also anti-inflammatory properties and i have to say that the best result tends to be when you combine topicals and normals together there's a synergy that comes into play and i find myself using a lot of cilantro in the acute phase and then i'll often phase azoleic acid in when things are a bit calmer with tetracyclines in the background now in difficult cases we do sometimes use low-dose isotretinoin raccotine or accutane depending on where you are in the world and we also use alpha blocker drugs for somebody who's particularly prone to flushing its causing issues so those are other treatments that we do sometimes use but the mainstay of rosacea treatment are those topicals i mentioned plus or minus tetracyclines which can be used sporadically when needed and i find that for many patients that's a successful toolkit for managing rosacea now when it comes to skin care don'ts i think it's important to be cautious when using anything outside of the list i mentioned before so things i would actively discourage you using because i think they just potentially cause too many problems and offer a little upside so i think double cleansing is a no-no i think pretty much all toners are of little to no benefit and quite likely to cause problems almost all face masks will be problematic very few masks are formulated to redness prone skin i think in a way that's useful in addition to those topicals that we mentioned that are much more important when it comes to regulating your skin physical exfoliants i think for obvious reasons are a no-no chemical sunscreens i would advocate using with caution my experience is that all mineral sunscreens are infinitely more comfortable and easy to use and if you use a tinted one you have the added benefit of a little bit of redness masking and then as far as treatments i really would encourage caution um when it comes to facials and redness really the principles of managing rosacea are about consistent daily use of the right skin care and topicals and i think that the concept of a facial once a month every six weeks really has little benefit to offer and is much more likely to cause flares so i don't think facials are particularly good idea in this instance so in conclusion i'd say that rosacea can be tricky to manage and i definitely think that if you're just starting out on your rosacea journey you think you've got that as a problem with your skin but you're not sure it really is invaluable to go and get some professional guidance on this both in terms of getting it under control with the right topicals um in the short term but also you know a longer term plan you're likely to need a longer term maintenance schedule to keep your skin well controlled but i have to say that with my rosacea patients they're often pleasantly surprised by how easily it we get their skin under control but also how we're then able to evolve their skin care routine into the realms of treating premature aging and i'll get into that in next week's video because i think it's an important topic to cover um but i think don't be despondent i think there are lots of great options now in terms of treating it getting it under control i can speak from first hand that my skin is a lot easier to manage now that i'm on a regimented and simple effective skincare routine so if you have rosacea you know someone who has rosacea please feel free to share this video if you found it helpful um come back next week to dive into rosacea treatment and beyond and i'll see you guys again soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "transcript": "let's talk about a condition called rosacea where\u00a0\nyour cheeks are red and you can have these little\u00a0\u00a0 red capillary breaks as well now this is another\u00a0\none of those unknown conditions but anytime\u00a0\u00a0 there's a condition where there's an unknown\u00a0\ncause you have to find out what is known to try to\u00a0\u00a0 associate and align things to see if you can come\u00a0\nup with a a natural remedy but here's what we know\u00a0\u00a0 about rosacea the normal treatment which seems to\u00a0\nbe somewhat effective is treating with antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 but not just regular antibiotics those antibiotics\u00a0\nthat also are anti-parasitic so based on that data\u00a0\u00a0 this condition could fall in the area of being\u00a0\ninduced by a parasite or a bacteria now there's\u00a0\u00a0 another remedy that seems to also help people it's\u00a0\ncalled ivermectin now ivermectin is anti-parasitic\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also anti-inflammatory so it can help\u00a0\nwith parasites as well as inflammation it's also\u00a0\u00a0 anti-lyse anti-scabies and what's interesting\u00a0\nabout iberomectin it was developed in japan\u00a0\u00a0 from a single microorganism in the soil which\u00a0\nis actually quite fascinating now there's also\u00a0\u00a0 some very interesting additional information about\u00a0\nivermectin and covid 19 which i can't talk about\u00a0\u00a0 but you can do your own research now another\u00a0\nthing about rosacea is that it's seen in\u00a0\u00a0 cushing's disease where you have high levels\u00a0\nof cortisol and by the way as a side note\u00a0\u00a0 anytime you have a high level sustained release of\u00a0\na certain hormone whether it's insulin or cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 you can start developing insulin or cortisol\u00a0\nresistance in which you have a situation where\u00a0\u00a0 this hormone might be at high levels but it's\u00a0\nnot working and the reason i'm bringing that up\u00a0\u00a0 is that in cushing disease you have cortisol\u00a0\nand cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 so obviously if there's inflammation\u00a0\nof the skin and there's this redness\u00a0\u00a0 and you have high levels of cortisol it\u00a0\njust means that it's not working the other\u00a0\u00a0 interesting thing about this is that you can also\u00a0\nhave a steroid-induced rosacea so apparently it's\u00a0\u00a0 probably this cortisol resistance which actually\u00a0\ncreates a deficiency of cortisol that's really\u00a0\u00a0 setting the person up for this condition now\u00a0\nthe other thing that we know about rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 is what triggers it extreme temperatures strenuous\u00a0\nexercise extreme heat from the sun sunburn stress\u00a0\u00a0 cold winds basically any type of stressful\u00a0\nsituation can trigger it so based on this\u00a0\u00a0 information it looks like rosacea is\u00a0\na combination of adrenal dysfunction\u00a0\u00a0 maybe a parasite or some microorganism maybe\u00a0\nsome imbalance in your gut because people with\u00a0\u00a0 sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth also\u00a0\nhave a higher incidence of getting rosacea so\u00a0\u00a0 based on that here's what i'm going to recommend\u00a0\nneem oil which is anti-parasitic anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 and you mix a few drops with coconut oil and\u00a0\nyou rub that into your skin i would also take\u00a0\u00a0 wormwood extract orally clove orally and i\u00a0\nwould definitely do fasting there's been some\u00a0\u00a0 great results with rosacea after doing fasting and\u00a0\nthe last thing i would do is i would definitely\u00a0\u00a0 support your adrenal glands to help normalize\u00a0\ncortisol if you want more data about that\u00a0\u00a0 check out some of the links down below hey before\u00a0\nyou go if you're benefiting from any of my content\u00a0\u00a0 i would love to hear about your success\u00a0\nstory please share it in the link down below",

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds today we are going to talk about the best hacks to instantly reduce redness but before we do that I'm going to take off my sunglasses it has been nearly now two weeks since I had my at Lasik eye procedure my eyes are still red I am still not wearing makeup around my eyes and I just find these lights to be distracting so off they go you guys are gonna have to deal with a bare face to me and I apologize if I am the stuff of Nightmares on your Saturday morning with my red eyes but let us jump It's dedicated to all of the rosacea sufferers out there because it is National rosacea awareness month and it's about damn time that we normalize rosacea so many millions of people are living with this condition and are quite frankly living in embarrassment Yours Truly kind of included because I had a lot of flushing this is the time to make all this information much more accessible to everybody and it's about time that we understand how we are treated how we tackle it how we deal with it what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition it is something that you are going to live with for years you cannot just get rid of it like that and it is a condition in which your skin can look red and inflamed and oftentimes you hear oh I'm so annoyed because my emotions are showing on my face if you get nervous if you get stressed right away you show up on your face and you cannot hide from your own face so it's a condition that can really have a mental stigma associated with it and people are oftentimes a little bit weirded out by others who have rosacea unfortunately because they think oh they're oily they're greasy their face is flaky are they so uncontrolled uncontrollable with their emotions because everything shows on their face so it's something that we really do need to normalize there are four subtypes the first two are the most common the first one being erythematodeic rosacea where you have a lot of broken capillaries on your face and redness and over time you just develop worsening of those broken capillaries and redness and they become more prominent and then you have the papillopustular variant which is oftentimes confused with adult acne but it's very different than adult acne and the biggest point of difference at least clinically what you can see is that with rosacea there are no blackheads hyperloopustular rosacea you have pustules little tiny white juicy pimples as well as blemishes on a red base that appears slightly swollen the third variant is feminist rosacea where you get enlargement of your nose your chin your forehead over time because of enlarged sweat glands and then the fourth variant is ocular rosacea because it can affect the eyes the eyelid margins become red you look like you're a blood shot and your eye sensation feels gritty it's important to treat these patients with an oral antibiotic because you want to minimize any long-term eye damage so who gets it and why we do not know it is an equal opportunity chronic inflammatory condition it can affect anybody at any age but you tend to see it more so in people with fair skin obviously because the redness comes through more so you definitely tend to notice it more but in Darker skin populations it's important to realize if something is rosacea versus acne because you do not want to be using for example tretinoin on a rosacea phase if you are a darker skin type and you do not actually have acne it will further irritate your rosacea the cause itself is unknown genetics do play a role we think it is multifactorial from a broken Skin Barrier to mites living on your skin everybody has mites on our skin but some people are more sensitive to it to a yeast that can exacerbate it to bacteria like I mentioned you name it the whole shebang bada bang is part of the actual cause of rosacea but there are certain triggers that rosacea has that have been very well documented and that we can avoid the first one being alcohol you know that red face that I'm talking about as can caffeine as can chocolate as can spicy foods heat Hot Yoga forgetting and stress of course can definitely affect it as well as certain medications the list pretty much goes on but this is why you absolutely need to be on top of how your skin feels it's important to learn your skin understand its emotions understand its reactivity because your skin has its own mindset and it is going to be reacting in a certain way so if you are understanding that you're a step ahead and you can literally help yourself faster we're going to first just focus in this video on the redness and the blemishes aspect of rosacea forget the nose and the eyes lasers are a huge part of that the gold standard to treating the redness is truly a laser in office but a laser in office is like going for a teeth cleaning once a year without you brushing your teeth on a daily basis if you're not brushing your teeth every day what the hell is the point of subjecting yourself to the torture of a dentist's chair for a yearly teeth cleaning same goes with a laser forget lasers if you're not doing the appropriate skincare routine because you will be pissing money away very very fast so that is super super important which leads me to number two a targeted skincare routine you need to understand why you are using products what you're trying to get out of them and what are the claims and this is actually something I have for you guys leave a comment below what sort of claims those rosacea sufferers who are watching do you look for on a package when you're trying to find products to help you target your redness your rosacea your blemishes let me know below what kind of claims or what kind of like statements you're looking for because the things you should be looking for are things that help reduce the look of redness with ingredients that bring visible redness down things that help soothe and calm your skin because you want to restore your Skin Barrier and reduce any sort of inflammation fragrance free now I love fragrance I'm not gonna lie I love the aromatherapy with skin care so I'm not a fragrant demonizer okay because you have a lot of fragrance Warriors out there but if you have rosacea you should probably steer clear of things with fragrances because it can definitely irritate your skin and make things worse and then four any product that has a green tint or hue to it is going to help color correct your look of your rosacea so those are very important things to look for when you're talking about rosacea and then last rosacea is oftentimes referred to as adult acne but it is not adult acne like I've said several times already you do not have blackheads with rosacea so it's important that you understand this and that you avoid harsh ingredients like retinol unfortunately or even adapaline because retinols can really trigger that inflammatory response and the truth is if you really truly have papillopustular rosacea you don't really really need a retinol right now wait until your skin is less inflamed in a steady state to try to dip your toes into the retinol world so all of this leads me to products that can help you that hacks that will that will make sure that your rosacea doesn't appear as intense and that your redness goes down over time first and foremost starting with cleansers event is a well-known brand for redness sufferers because it is made with mineral Waters that have magnesium silica calcium in them those minerals have been shown to have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect we believe that helps in chronic conditions like rosacea this is their real levantipidant the exera calm that you guys can definitely try selfless by Hiram is an affordable one now at Target this guy has centella and green tea both of which have been shown to soothe your skin it retails for 16 it is relatively cheap and it is glycerin based and then a tried and true is Vanna cream I love vano cream it's a very simple cleanser however is it great for removing makeup not so much so you're gonna probably need to associate that one with like a bioderma micellar water Sorel which is a Ketoconazole shampoo it's not a cleanser it's actually a shampoo for people with dandruff but a lot of rosacea sufferers have that like swelling and that redness associated with the flaking so if you use this three or four times a week on those areas let it sit for a few minutes and then wash it off you're going to really help yourself by minimizing not just the redness but also the flakes Associated because you want to kill the yeast that is usually contributing to that but these sort of cleansers are much more targeted and if you are going to be using a cleanser like this let it sit for a few minutes on your face before washing it off to let some of those ingredients do their job in minimizing the redness in the long run if you are looking for things like Mists I mentioned events thermal water this is where this guy comes into play if you're using this just to hydrate your face like on an airplane there are better ones you could use if you are using this to help soothe redness and reduce inflammation then you're using it the right way I also believe Tower 28 hypochlorous acid is a really good one they're SOS spray people have confused this with salt water it is not salt water it is not bleach it's a different chemical composition and it has been shown to be at a gentler pH that is more balanced with your skin and it is less aggressive so it can help disinfect get rid of all of that antimicrobial activity that can be further worsening your rosacea like we talked about so I actually use that during the day and I did at the height of the pen endemic in my mask because I was breaking out around my mouth and it helped tremendously serums this is where we can have some fun with some of the hacks obviously I just launched my product I'm going to Shameless plug it in but this is a serum the de-puffer is actually a redness reducing serum and I wanted to call it the D flusher at one point I was told it's not a sexy name so we called it the d-puffer but it is a redness reducing serum mixed up with centella asiatica niacinamide is only capped at five percent so you're not going to get higher than that and then you also have other ingredients that are clinically proven to reduce redness so twice a day this serum definitely helps it's also darker in color which also helps to kind of block that underlying redness in Beauty's projects green machine is a vitamin C serum that is also green the reason I like this particular vitamin C is that it's Tetra hexadecile ascorbate in a very light watery serum form as you guys I'll show you guys please we've talked about this product and it's light green in tint tetrahexodescorbate is a type of vitamin C it's not an active form so it's not going to be as irritating as ascorbic acid so if you're looking to incorporate a vitamin C I would try this but like with anything what I may be sensitive to you may not be so always patch test first before putting your full face into this Paula's Choice azelic acid is a ingredient that we prescribe in practice it is one that we don't really know exactly very honestly how it works but it has antimicrobial properties it has anti-inflammatory properties and it also allows your skin to regulate itself much more cohesively so that buildup is not happening on your face but it stinks as the lake acid smells bad and it pills so if you get away with using it during the day good for you and it's not pilling but chances are it might be pilling so use it at night but this is 10 and that is The Sweet Spot that you need to be in in order to get actual benefit from it we also have the ordinaries as like as suspension this one definitely pills but it is much cheaper it is also at 10 it retails for eleven dollars you might as well try this baby out so that I'm not as red as I usually am after I sneezed and then in terms of sunscreen several tried and truths are Dr jarts sicko pair I have heard complaints from people of Darker skin tones that it's not for them and this is not for them there's only so much a cream can sort of pick up the colors of your skin and change in tint but it does pick up a lighter sort of my skin tone maybe one or two shades above my skin tone but if you are darker than that you're going to think it looks pasty and I have heard recently that the hero Cosmetics Force Shield super light sunscreen SPF 30 is also great because it is unscented and it has a green tint and it retails for twenty dollars physical sunscreens here are better suited for you than chemical sunscreens because they're not going to be potentially irritating whereas chemical sunscreens can be much more irritating but again not all physical sunscreens are created equal so these are two that I recommend if you have longer term rosacea and a hack that I absolutely love especially in the summertime when it is hot if I'm in a stressful situation and I kind of don't care is a cooling neck fan and I put this around my neck for two reasons one so I don't get red but two so that my melasma doesn't flare up but it is a neck fan that looks like a headset like a Bose headset so let it be but it works wonders if I'm in the beach or I'm walking outside and it's 90 degrees I love it it keeps me cool and it keeps my face less likely to flush prescriptions I mentioned as like acid metronidazole is one Ivermectin is another these three are often combined together for the perfect formula Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic but we have a Mite on our face that rosacea suffers are more prone to known as the demodexmite so it helps to calm it down and obviously antibiotics are often times used as a mainstream treatment not only for their antibiotic effect but for their anti-inflammatory effect so with that I hope you guys found this video helpful these are hacks that you can do to help yourself if you want to take it a step further we can go into the office one day and talk about various treatments let me know in the comments below if that is something that you guys are interested in but I am genuinely curious to know what it is that you guys are looking for in terms of product textures and claims and I hope you have a beautiful Saturday I hope this video is eye-opening I hope you learned a hack or two the reality is consistency is key especially when it comes to your skincare routine and there are no quick fixes sadly I'm Dr Shireen Idris and I will see you guys next week foreign [Music]",

        "description": "Ocular rosacea is the most underdiagnosed form of dry eye that I see every day in my clinic! If you have red, itchy, and burning ...",
        "published_at": "2022-01-08T13:57:09Z",
        "transcript": "Hi I\u2019m Dr. Michele Lee, a board-certified\nophthalmologist, and in this video I am going to address a very common and underdiagnosed\ncause of dry eye: ocular rosacea. So let\u2019s start by talking about rosacea. Rosacea is a skin condition of the mid-face\nthat affects up to 20% of people. People with rosacea are typically prone to\na long blush or flush that can resemble a sunburn, acne-like bumps referred to as papules\nor pustules, or skin texture changes. Rosacea tends to start around middle-age,\nin cycles, and is usually triggered by sun exposure, heat, stress, red wine and other\nalcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. While we don\u2019t really understand the mechanism\nof rosacea, we do know this is an inflammatory condition with an abnormal immune system response,\nand that there is a genetic component to this condition. There are multiple theories on why some people\nget rosacea, including theories linking the bacteria in our gut or small intestine bacterial\novergrowth and mites called Demodex that may be inducing skin inflammation. There are 4 types of rosacea and many people\naffected by rosacea may experience more than one type. Besides ocular or eye rosacea, which I will\nget to later in the video, there is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which is characterized by a prolonged\nblush and persistent redness of the face. With this type of rosacea, you can often see\nenlarged small blood vessels on the skin. Another type is papulopustular rosacea, which\nis characterized by whitehead pustules, which are red and pus-filled blemishes on the cheeks,\nchin, and forehead that are often confused with acne. The most rare and severe form is phymatous\nrosacea, which can result in thickening and discoloration of the skin. Phymatous rosacea usually affects the nose\nand is more common in men than women. So how does this condition affect our eyes? Well, this is a disease of the mid-face, and\nguess what is also in our mid-face? Our lower eyelids! In ocular rosacea, we see inflammation of\nour lower eyelids, classically lid margin telangiectasias. This is easily seen and noted with the slit-lamp\nmicroscope we use in our eye clinic. In ocular rosacea, eyelid inflammation can\ncause blockage of the meibomian, or oil, glands that provide the oil layer of our tears. Having blocked oil glands can cause a form\nof evaporative dry eye, where you make tears but don\u2019t make good quality tears to lubricate\nyour eyes and make you more prone to styes and chalazia, which are caused by blocked\nsweat and oil glands on the eyelids. In addition to dry eye, the eyelids can feel\nirritated and itchy from all the inflammation. In general, there are multiple treatments\nfor rosacea, many of which are beyond the scope of this video on ocular or eye rosacea. First and foremost, preventing and avoiding\ntriggers is the most effective thing you can do. If you suffer from rosacea, please consult with your dermatologist about a treatment plan for your\nskin that might work for you. For ocular rosacea, the treatment principles\nare similar to treating rosacea of the skin. There are a few levels of treatments that\nI discuss with my patients, depending on severity of disease and previous response to medications. Just like with skin rosacea, we want to avoid\nflares, whatever that may be. For some, this includes avoiding heat and\nwarm compresses to the eyes and eyelids, which is unfortunately an effective treatment for\nalmost every other type of dry eye. With minor irritation or symptoms, lubricating\neye drops, specifically preservative-free eye artificial tears, work best. Just how inflamed rosacea skin is sensitive,\nthe eyes and eyelids of rosacea patients are usually sensitive as well and avoiding any\ntriggers, including unnecessary preservatives, can be helpful. If preservative-free tears are not enough,\nwe might need to escalate treatment to a short-term, low-dose steroid eye drop for flares. We never want to stay on steroids for a long\ntime if we can help it, as steroid eye drops for years, even at low doses, can accelerate\ncataracts and elevate eye pressure in a small percentage of patients. Just like with other types of skin rosacea,\noral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines like doxycycline, can be effective in some cases\nof ocular rosacea. Doxycycline at low doses (under 50mg) has\nanti-inflammatory properties that both clinically and symptomatically can help with rosacea\nwhen taken long term. A newer treatment for rosacea and ocular rosacea\nis Intense Pulsed Light or IPL, a laser treatment that has been used for hyperpigmentation of\nthe skin and other types of rosacea and is now being increasingly used for ocular rosacea. This treatment can be effective with multiple\nuses, and there are some eye doctors who use a specific ocular protocol for ocular rosacea\nwith notable success. While this is still not a common tool in every\neye clinic, this is becoming increasingly popular and we might be seeing this tool in\nmore eye clinics as a treatment option for this form of dry and irritated eyes and eyelids. Do you think you might have ocular rosacea? Let me know in the comments below. As a rosacea patient myself, I am very passionate\nabout spreading awareness of rosacea and would love your support so please like and subscribe\nto my channel, and see you next week in my next video.

        "transcript": "well hey guys how do you tell the difference between acne and rosacea in today's video I'm going to explain to you exactly how to do that now if you're dealing with redness and painful pimples breakouts you might think you have acne but you could actually have rosacea they look very similar as I've said before not everything that looks like acne is acne and rosacea is pretty darn common and the reason it's so important to tell the difference and know what you're dealing with is because the approach to treating each condition is very different and in order to get good control of either condition you've got to know what it is you are dealing with when it comes to acne the signature skin lesion the spot that is very characteristic of acne is called a Comey Dome basically a plugged up pore now that comidone can have a black spot in it or it can present as a white bump these are commonly referred to as blackheads and whiteheads but the medical term for them is open and closed comedones but with acne you can also have Painful nodules and cysts and you can have red bombs that fill with pus as referred to as pustules in contrast with rosacea you can have red spots you can have pustules but there are no comedones no blackheads no white heads people with rosacea they can have very prominent pores but the pores are not clogged poor clogging is not a part of rosacea both acne and rosacea present with facial redness but where the redness is located is different in each condition with acne the redness tends to be confined around the breakouts whereas with rosacea the redness is more widespread covering the cheeks the nose the forehead the chin with rosacea the redness can come and go with acne the redness pretty much goes along with the breakout and it may last long after the breakout has healed that's referred to as post acne erythema now I have a whole video explaining that and how to get rid of that so check that video out and in the beginning with rosacea the redness actually comes and goes but with time if the rosacea is not kept under good control that redness can persist and be there all the time fixed facial redness acne affects the skin rosacea affects the skin and it often can affect the eyes this can appear with bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids swollen eyelids dry eyes and The Sensation of like grittiness in the eyes that is a very important distinction over half of people who have rosacea have involvement of their eyes a trigger for acne is an increase in oil production and people who have acne often tend to have oily skin not 100 of them do but many of them do because the oiliness really feeds the little bacteria that live in the Skin Within the pore and that all leads to inflammation rosacea on the other hand is not necessarily an oily skin condition sure you may have a genetic tendency towards oiliness along with rosacea but the oiliness is not playing a role in rosacea so treatments that address oiliness will not improve the rosacea whereas treatments that address oiliness can help improve acne another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea is what happens when you do nothing when you do nothing with acne the consequence Downstream is that it can heal with a scar there are a lot of different types of acne scars I have videos on this channel as to the different types of acne scars the different treatments for these scarves as a reminder you can have a raised SCAR or you can have a depressed scar acne can also heal with a dark mark or a red mark post acne redness post acne hyperpigmentation rosacea on the other hand left untreated left uncontrolled the consequence of that is that the individual can go on to experienced persistent facial redness that does not go away they also can develop prominent dilated blood vessels and in some cases although pretty rare it is also possible to develop skin thickening in the areas involved with the rosacea this is referred to as feminist change often can involve the nose but it can really affect anywhere on the face where you've got rosacea flares chin forehead in contrast to acne climate as change is not a scar but as you can see it's important to treat both conditions because there are consequences that are long-lasting when the conditions are not appropriately managed another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea are the symptoms acne especially cystic acne can be very very painful but a lot of times acne can also itch rosacea on the other hand is a skin condition where one of the Hallmark findings is the fact that patients are exquisitely sensitive to things that come in contact with the skin whether that be makeup sunscreen perfume skin care products other Cosmetics they're also exquisitely sensitive to the Sun as well as to wind and to just really anything coming in contact with the skin and this leads to symptoms of burning stinging sometimes itch sometimes discomfort sometimes a feeling of heat in the skin when you're asking yourself is this acne or is this rosacea pay attention to the location where you are breaking out acne tends to affect the forehead the cheeks the nose it can affect the neck the upper chest and the upper back as well as the shoulders whereas rosacea tends to affect the mid face like the cheeks over the nose it can also affect the forehead and the chin it can extend to involve the scalp and it also can involve the neck the upper chest and the upper back the people who get acne are a little different from the people who get rosacea although there is some overlap people who get acne most commonly are in their teens are tweens but truthfully you can develop acne at any age including in a newborn and adults as a side note recently I did a whole video on acne in your 40s and above so check that one out we explain why you are still breaking out breaking out for the first time as an adult acne affects all Races all skin tones rosacea on the other hand while it really could occur at any age generally speaking it impacts adults 30 years of age and above of course there are exceptions to that but it generally is a disease that first presents in adulthood all Races can be affected by rosacea it is generally taught that rosacea is a lot more common in people who have paler skin types I have always questioned this because I do think that and people who have a deeper skin tone it's very easy to miss a diagnosis of rosacea because the redness of rosacea can be very subtle in a deeper skin tone so getting a really good history for my patient with a deeper skin tone and always considering rosacea as a possibility is super important I think a lot of patients who have deeper skin tones might accidentally be misdiagnosed as having acne if you don't have blackheads and whiteheads and you also have symptoms of Exquisite sensitivity burning stinging if you feel as though your eyes are are being impacted you've got bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids a feeling of like something in your eye you might actually have rosacea I want to interject why it's so important to distinguish the two accurately because the treatment for one could potentially worsen the other condition so that's why why an accurate diagnosis is King taking a step back let's let's talk about what causes acne as opposed to what causes rosacea the causes are different both conditions likely have an underlying genetic component we can always blame our genetics oh officer I was going 10 miles over the speed limit because it's my genetics it's just in my DNA I digress all right when it comes to acne there are a few factors playing a role acne is a condition where the sebaceous oil gland plays a major role as I mentioned earlier with acne you have an increase in sebum output that is largely governed by genetics again as well as your hormones um whereas rosacea there is no issue going on with the sebaceous oil gland putting out more oil so there's you know that takes that out of the equation with acne you also have a problem with the cells lining the pore not turning over efficiently they kind of get stuck together and that's what leads to those comedones blackheads and whiteheads with rosacea that's not what's going on and with acne as a consequence of the plugging up of the pore and the increase in sebum you have another little Factor down there in your pore called cutie bacterium acne that is a part of everyone's skin but when it's down there in an acne pore and within that comidone and with all that extra sea bomb it starts snacking on that breaks it down into something that triggers a lot of inflammation and that's what leads to painful acne cysts think of rosacea on the other hand as a problem that is a neurosensory issue where you have little nerves that go through your skin and for whatever reason in rosacea the working idea is that the nerves in rosacea release inflammatory mediators apparently upon exposure to otherwise innocuous things that can lead to blood vessel dilation with rosacea there's also some degree of local skin immune dysregulation now in acne I mentioned there's a little bacteria that lives on everyone's skin who is kind of to blame for some of the acne symptoms while that character cutie bacterium acnes is not playing a role in rosacea there is another Little Critter that likely plays a major role in a lot of people's rosacea and that is Demodex mites Demodex are part of everyone's natural skin biology but it's thought that for people who have rosacea they have an abnormal inflammatory response to that little Mite or they have an overabundance of that little mind so you'll see that some of the treatments for rosacea actually specifically Target that part of rose Asia namely ivermecta and topical Ivermectin sold the brand name for that is cilantro so the root causes of acne and rosacea are much different and the things that trigger an acne flare are very different from the things that trigger a rosacea flare with acne you can get a flare from changes in your hormones this is especially the case when you have acne as an adult adult women with acne breakouts a lot of it can be influenced by changes in the hormones the Androgen hormones signal to the oil gland make more oil and that can lead to acne breakouts with acne you also have things that you put on your skin can potentially trigger acne flares if they are comedogenic now skin care products are not formulated to be comedogenic but sometimes sometimes patients find that certain products lead to worsening of acne aggravate their acne especially the kids with very heavy oily Cosmetics or heavy oily hair care products like oily pomades are known to trigger comedones on the forehead or the sides of the face face where the hair touches medications and supplements can trigger acne certain diets may play a role in someone's tendency to have more stubborn acne I I have a video all about a clear skin diet and foods that researchers believe may play a role in acne but suffice it to say the full story on how our foods and diets impact an individual's tendency towards acne are not fully elucidated and acne can have an interesting response to sun exposure some people find that their acne actually calms down a bit with sun exposure but it's clear that acne can get a lot worse after sun exposure likely because exposure to the sun is immunosuppressive but you can get this rebound worsening of acne now rosacea on the other hand let's unpack the triggers there do hormones influence rosacea they probably do to a certain extent but there's not that underlying issue of Androgen hormones driving oil production and leading to to flares that's specific to acne not really it's not a major driving force although you may find that your skin is even more sensitive active with changes in hormones for example changes and hormone profiles around your menstrual cycle may make your skin overall more sensitive more prone to redness skin care products Cosmetics fragrances things that come in contact with the skin are notorious for triggering rosacea and I always get a lot of questions like what skin care products are off limits for rosacea a lot of it really is highly variable and very unique to the individual but in general things like Menthol fragrance ingredients that have cinnamon cinnamaldehyde these can actually trigger vasodilation and worsen redness now heavy moisturizers in rosacea actually can trigger a flare much different from how heavy greasy products might aggravate acne by potentially poor clogging with rosacea a really really heavy moisturizer may actually make you feel a little overheated because it might slow down the evaporate operation of sweat and as you start to feel overheated your body's response to that is going to be to flush and so it can trigger a flush a flare of rosacea with flushing and blushing which is a Hallmark symptom of rosacea upon exposure to things that are irritating to the skin rosacea definitely can be triggered by many different foods I have a video going into detail about different foods that trigger facial redness if you have rosacea you absolutely need to watch that video because there are some mechanisms there that I think will be very helpful for you to understand spicy foods tend to be a culprit likely through vasodilation a lot of people with rosacea are very sensitive to alcohol triggers a flush not everyone for whatever reason red wine seems to be more of a culprit for a lot of people but again it's very individualized so just pay attention to how your skin responds when you do consume alcohol and consider omitting it completely or perhaps it's a certain type of alcohol that's more of a problem for you you also have to be careful with consuming hot liquids like hot tea hot coffee drinking warm soups because that warmth can precipitate a flush of course again this is not true for everyone but it is a relatively common trigger in rosacea you definitely need to be very cognizant of your sun exposure because UV rays definitely are a notorious trigger for a rosacea flare in general people with rosacea are more sensitive to heat that can be from the environment or from sitting next to a heater once they start getting overheated and flush boom that can trigger trigger a flare of course harsh skin care products excessive cleansing definitely can aggravate rosacea something that is common to both acne and rosacea that a lot of people Miss is the fact that both conditions there is an underlying problem with the Skin Barrier and therefore moisturizing can be beneficial for minimizing symptoms and minimizing flare of both conditions it's just a matter of choosing a moisturizer that works for your skin and doesn't actually aggravate your skin so for acne if you find that certain moisturizers seem to aggravate breakouts then avoid those and go with something that is more lightweight likewise with rosacea pick a moisturizer that is more lightweight it's not going to feel heavy on the skin it's going to you know in most cases for people with rosacea it's best to choose products that are free of fragrance and and common irritants like certain essential oils for example because these ingredients they may actually worsen redness cause vasodilation and precipitate a flare so go really mild really boring really Bland now that you know a little bit about how these two differ hopefully these tips in this video arm you with the information that maybe you can begin to distinguish yourself why do we treat acne why do we treat rosacea it's important to treat acne because regardless of acne severity it can go on to lead to permanent scarring which is what we're really trying to prevent and it also can lead to very stubborn hyperpigmentation and very stubborn redness around the acne breakouts that takes a long time to resolve the other reason to treat acne is because it has a huge impact on your quality of life and a lot of people with acne that is untreated they have a lot of mental health consequences as a result so treating your acne could potentially help with your mental health research it clearly shows that having acne is associated with more symptoms of depression and a lot of acne treatments once initiated and the acne improves there is an improvement in the mental health symptoms so that is another potential benefit and the other reason to treat acne is treating it early prevents further flares treating acne also can help give you some relief from the pain and possible itch of painful acne lesions why treat rosacea it's important to treat rosacea because treating it especially early can prevent you going on to have fixed facial redness it can basically help in preventing it from getting worse can prevent you from going on to develop those prominent dilated blood vessels telangentasias and treating it early can help get you some relief from the most uncomfortable symptoms of flushing blushing burning stinging treating rosacea is also very beneficial for your overall quality of life and again your mental health both acne and rosacea untreated can impact your quality of life and mental health which in and of itself is definitely a reason to pursue treatment the other reason it's important to evaluate and treat rosacea early on is to assess for comorbid eye involvement over half of patients with rosacea will have involvement of their eyes sometimes the eye involvement comes long before the skin symptoms and so untreated the eye involvement can lead to eye problems symptoms in the eyes include bloodshot eyes crusting of the eyelids swollen eyelids itchy dry eyes and if not those symptoms persist then that inflammation in the eye can have consequences for your eye health so evaluating rosacea early on in the course and looking for possible eye involvement and treating and addressing that appropriately through you know referral to referral to an ophthalmologist if necessary is really important now I encourage you to see a board-certified dermatologist for evaluation and management so that you can not only ensure that you have the right diagnosis but that you're on the best treatment plan for you treating acne treating rosacea it's not a cookbook approach everyone's acne differs everyone's rosacea differs and what's going to be an appropriate treatment for one person is simply not going to be right for another person it's not a cookbook approach you know you don't take a patient with rosacea and say if rosacea then X Y and Z it's not that algorithmic some things are going to be better options depending on overall symptoms skin lesions severity all sorts of the factors go into go into picking the best treatment for either acne or rosacea anyways guys I hope this video was helpful in laying out how to distinguish acne from rosacea how they differ hopefully gave you a clear understanding that the treatment approaches need to be much different and they're tailored to the root causes of both conditions now as I mentioned I have a video on foods that cause facial redness I'm going to link that on the end slate make sure you watch that if you are dealing with facial redness of any form including related to rosacea because you will identify potentially certain foods that may be aggravating it if you guys enjoyed this video though give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye thank you [Music]",

        "transcript": "[Music] i'm dr casey nistel practicing as a consultant dermatologist at nermal skin and hair clinic vijayanagara bangalore rosacea is a condition which affects not only teenage people but also across all age groups this is a condition which is very similar to acne but with persistent redness happening on the nose cheeks sometimes on the forehead and chin many times even if the acne or the pimples come down the redness and the sensitivity of the skin to the uv rays is very prominent and bothersome so the real challenge in treating rosacea is often the redness and the flushing botulinum toxin is one molecule which has been for a long time used to relax the muscle and it is also used for other conditions like treating palmo plantar hyperhidrosis that's the excess sweating in the palms and soles and also in the underarms see this molecule works by inhibiting the abnormal nerve impulses so whenever there is any secretion so there is no impulse similarly whenever there is redness which is happening that is the inflammation so whenever there is inflammation there is amount of all these neurovascular derangements so bottleneck toxin basically helps in reducing this neurovascular derangement means whatever the abnormal nerve impulse is being liberated towards the blood vessel is being blocked so that the abnormal blood vessel reaction which actually gives rise to the redness starts getting better second thing is botulinum toxin also has effect on some important cells in the inflammation that is the muscle these muscles are lot of inflammatory mediators which when released gives rise to redness swelling burning itching sensation so as we all know rosacea has lot of redness sometimes burning sensation as well so when these mediators are blocked the redness starts improving so muscle degranulation is actually effectively inhibited by botulinum toxin so this toxin can be used effectively to treat rosacea it may not be the first line of treatment but for reducing the redness for reducing the flushing the sensitivity of the skin definitely bottle of toxin can be explored second advantage of the bottle of toxin is we all know that it's a temporary treatment it lasts for about four to six months but if the relief is good it's worth trying and third thing is there's a lot of safety data on the use of botnum toxins for the phase already so there is no harm in going in with bottleneck toxin treatment for rosacea",

        "transcript": "it has been a hot minute since my last rosacea video If you deal with rosacea you are going to want to watch this one what exactly is the root cause of rosacea well if you are looking for one single root cause I hate to break it to you rosacea is multi-factorial meaning there are multiple things that come together to lead to one's risk and symptoms of rosacea we always can point a finger at that double helix are genetics it seems as though hormones Also may be PL role for whatever reason rosacea is significantly more common in women than men although men deal with it as well rosacea is characterized by sensitive skin as well as episodes of flushing and blushing these episodes can also lead to the formation of little bumps that look like pimples red spots red spots filled with puss and over time the flushing the blushing can become fixed fixed facial redness along with prominent dilated blood vessels when it comes to how we treat rosacea there is no cure we do things to control the symptoms prevent it from getting worse you have to be cognizant of how all of the different moving Parts work together to contribute to your disease and you have to be a proactive to manage these triggers big part of what underscores the sensitivity is actually a problem with the Skin Barrier the underlying barrier defect allows for irritating noxious substances to penetrate and cause symptoms of burning and stinging along with flushing and blushing then you have to be cognizant of environmental triggers a big big one is ultraviolet radiation from the Sun but also you have the contributing factor of heat whenever we get warm when we get um hot blood vessels dilate for rosacea this can bring about the flushing and the blushing then there is a contribution of microbes things that naturally live on our skin but also our gut microbiome our gut microbiome is an intimate player in skin Health there is a unique communication between the gut and the skin this axis can be skewed in such a way in individuals with rosacea making things like your diet super important to helping manage symptoms one microbe in particular is deodex those little mites that live in everyone's skin okay they're part of our normal skin microbiome but for patients who have rosacea they have a greater density of Demodex mites and of course the immune system the immune system as it circulates through the skin is overreactive um it's a bit melodramatic if you will and therefore leads to the release of more inflammatory mediators that trigger symptoms of sensitivity flushing blushing and overall flares and last but not least you also have the contribution of blood flow anything that increases blood flow can aggravate rosacea let's talk about the sensitivity remember I said there is a problem with barrier function so if you have rosacea a big part of managing your symptoms and staying on top of it is doing things that help to address the needs of your Skin's moisture barrier and it doesn't necessarily involve a complicated skincare routine and multiple skin care products although I do recommend a lightweight facial moisturizer applied at nighttime to help reduce transepidermal water loss which tends to be great at night and help soothe the skin however there are other things in your overall life that can significantly impact barrier function poor sleep is a Big Driver of impaired barrier function stress likewise compromises the Integrity of your barrier so making sure that you prioritize sleep and that you manage your stress it directly impacts the symptoms of sensitivity by addressing the needs of the moisture barrier if you are sleep deprived your skin is going to be losing more water you are going to be more vulnerable to the symptoms of sensitivity you have to be picky and choosy when it comes to your skinc care products certain products May aggravate your symptoms and it is not a oneandone avoid these products avoid these ingredients type list and everyone's rosacea is aggravated by different things diet makes a difference like I said there is an intimate connection between our gut and our skin and diets deficient in F fber that are fiber penic do not bode well for the health of your gut microbiome and potentially can skew things in a negative direction for your rosacea so make sure you are incorporating Whole Foods fruits vegetables whole grains to ensure that you are getting at least the recommended daily fiber intake omega-3 fatty acids also are really helpful because they can help cut down on the symptoms of dry eyes that all lot of patients deal with now should you take a supplement always discuss supplements with your healthc care provider but there are a variety of whole foods that are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids some research suggests that consuming green tea may help alleviate um the triggers around sun exposure also chamomile tea has been shown to be anti-inflammatory it may bode well for those with rosacea to incorporate caffeine from coffee actually has been associated with an improvement in symptoms a word of warning hot liquids whether it be beverages soups can bring about flushing so maybe stick to iced tea is there anything you should avoid in your diet if you have rosacea that might help you out well research suggests that diets rich in process refined sugary carbohydrates honestly are not good for anyone's skin but specifically with rosacea May contribute to overall more severe disease these types of diets tend to again be low in fiber low in anti-inflammatory rich foods and high in refined sugars that can lead to more inflammation which directly impacts the skin cinnamon Peppers chili Cayenne chocolate tomatoes and citrus check out my video All About foods that cause facial redness I go into detail about how these different foods contain compounds that can lead to either vasod dilation or trigger something called trpv1 channels that lead to either flushing and or the symptoms of sensitivity now again not everyone's rosacea is the same so these food groups may not be a problem for you but commonly they are for many people with rosacea so it's something for you to proactively look into alcoholic beverages are not your friend if you have rosacea a directly trigger phaso dilation try and eliminate alcoholic beverages it can really make a difference unfortunately fermented foods which are rich in histamine can be a trigger for a lot of people so like sauerkraut kimchi already talked about the importance of sleep and Stress Management for helping to mitigate flares the other thing is exercise exercise can be your friend but it also May trigger a flare so again anything that gets your heart rate up and brings blood flow to the face can precipitate a flush so how do you manage manage that I suggest when you are participating in cardiovascular activities to do your best to do so in a cool environment with good air circulation get a ice cold beverage to sipon that really can help ice chips can help slow down that rise in body temperature to the face you might want to avoid things like hot yoga or going into a hot sauna don't avoid exercise though because we know of course the cardiovascular benefits of exercise but it also has an anti-inflammatory effect I also encourage people to incorporate resistance training uh work out with weights because actually there is a small study that suggests that muscle mass is inversely correlated with rosacea severity so it potentially might be protective and of course we know it is good for your health to maintain a muscle let's talk about microbes specifically deodex mites like I said deodex mites are naturally present in everyone's skin but for people with rosacea they are more abundant and they contribute to the inflammatory milu in the skin and flares so there are medications specifically one called cilantro that directly Target this might uh also other medications that are prescribed for rosacea Target the inflammation that surrounds the Mite the M itself has a little bacteria that cooh habitat with it so the antibiotics that we often prescribe for rosacea not only are they anti-inflammatory but they may be working for rosacea by helping with that little pesky bacteria that is even more maybe driving the inflammatory responses in the skin regular cleansing and moisturizing the skin actually can be beneficial for cutting down on the burden of Demodex mites because they help exfoliate the skin improve moisture contents the skin exfoliates on its own more efficiently you see if you have a buildup of dry dull flaky skin Demodex really thrives in that so just consistent cleansing um one to two times daily as your rosacea tolerates a lot of people with rosacea only tolerate cleansing with a very mild creamy cleanser once a day ideally in the evening okay that's the best time to incorporate your cleanse helicobactor pylori this is a bacteria that you can become fected with um in your um digestive tract it can contribute to ulcers um there is an association with um this and uh rosacea and for some people treating it um helps the rosacea it's not clear though if that is really that strongly Associated but I thought I would address it here because I have seen some questions all right let's talk about skincare what kind of skincare products should you incorporate if you have rosacea at the very least a mild creamy cleanser a moisturizer and the most important thing is sunscreen UV is a big trigger for rosacea but there are a variety of ingredients that might be in your moisturizer that also could could be helpful for your rosacea for example licorice root niacinamide these are compounds that are anti-inflammatory and help soothe the skin as well as mitigate redness something that is not off the table is a top retinoid adapalene FDA approved for acne may also help rosacea by helping to clear up the little pimple like bumps now not everyone tolerates adapalene especially people who have rosacea but of of the retinoids it is one of the easiest to tolerate and if you tolerate it it definitely may help to improve your rosacea remember adapalene also has some anti-inflammatory properties to it so there's that and it may also help your skin enhance Ling the damaging effects of UV when paired with sunscreen so it really has a potential to work in your favor if you're able to tolerate it check out my video on using a retinoid for sensitive skin because they give a lot of practical tips for slowly introducing a retinoid to mitigate flares of sensitivity what about an exfoliant you've probably heard that if you have rosacea you should avoid things like glycolic acid lactic acid salicylic acid these things are too harsh they can work worsen the burning the stinging and a lot of the times that is absolutely true but also remember that for some people if they have that buildup of dry rough skin it could be directly compromising barrier Integrity as well as feeding into the Demodex proliferation so a group of exfoliants that often times are very well tolerated for people who have sensitive skin are polyhydroxy acids lactobionic acid for example not only do these gently exfoliate the skin removing that buildup of dry rough skin texture but they also help to improve moisture retention in the skin helping with barrier function so that's an ingredient family that you might not only tolerate but it might potentially benefit you then over the counter you have sulfur sulfur is underrated it's anti-inflammatory and soothing you've probably seen in the drugstore here in the US at least prosacea it is a topical sulfur gel marketed for people with rosacea that is great and then if you guys have been watching my channel for any number of years I'm a big fan of the de la Cru sulfur treatment it's really inexpensive and effective then um recently I did a video all about the efficacy of tranexamic acid topical tranexamic acid it actually can help with facial redness um often times it is something that we might try for people who have what's called post-inflammatory athema like from acne that healed with a persistent red mark But it um has been shown to be helpful for um certain types of rosacea when applied topically and yes I know the structure of tranexamic acid is kind of large and very polar and it's very questionable if it even gets into the skin without some sort of assistance from like micro needling but we do have evidence uh clinically that just applying it to the skin can help with redness quite a bit um for example the uh Polish Choice discoloration Repair Serum or the uh minimalist tranexamic acid serum these are options as well last but not least you have AIC acid okay so AIC acid is um at prescription strengths a good treatment for rosacea but you can also buy cosmetic products that have AIC acid mind you the AIC acid con conentration is lower than what is in the prescription strength stuff but it certainly can be helpful aoic acid does a lot of beneficial things for rosacea specifically in that a it's anti-inflammatory B it's antimicrobial and C it very mildly exfoliates the skin so it can help again with that Demodex issue all right y'all so that is a wrap up of the skin care that you might pursue on your own but remember you need to also be keeping watch on all of these other sort of outside influences that directly can aggravate your rosacea such as your sleep your diet your environment um you know your workout routine taking steps proactively to kind of manage all of these potential triggers and just being aware of what your triggers are makes a huge difference you don't need a complicated skin care routine less maybe more um just a mild cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen at the very least but yes you may find benefit from some of these other ingredients and cosmetic products let me know in the comments if you deal with rosacea I really hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen And subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]",

        "transcript": "are you struggling with facial redness postural spots or just irritated skin keep watching to learn a holistic approach to rosacea on its treatment in today's video if you're new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret known may be considered it's a powerful retinoid medication that's often used to treat severe acne but it can also be effective in treating rosacea it's only prescribed in specialist centers if you

        "transcript": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition\u00a0\nthat usually affects the face. Its often mistaken\u00a0\u00a0 for acne, eczema, or an even allergic skin\u00a0\nreaction. It causes redness and visible blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels in your face and sometimes produces\u00a0\nsmall red, pus filled bumps that flare up for\u00a0\u00a0 weeks to months, disappear and reappear when\u00a0\nyou least expect. In this video, im going to\u00a0\u00a0 go over what rosacea is, what causes it, how\u00a0\nto treat rosacea, and 1 very important tip you\u00a0\u00a0 dont want to miss out on when it comes to\u00a0\npreventing it,, so stay tuned till the end.\u00a0 Hi guys, yaseen arsalan, media pharmacist here on\u00a0\nyoutube, this week's video is on rosacea. Smash\u00a0\u00a0 the like button below NOW, as there is a ton\u00a0\nof useful information in here, that I know you\u00a0\u00a0 can benefit from. Also, it helps others find this\u00a0\nvideo as well, iso we can beat rosacea together.\u00a0 Rosacea affects more than 16 million Americans,\u00a0\nwhich is another reason why i wanted to make this\u00a0\u00a0 video. To hopefully point you in the direction\u00a0\nwhen it comes to understanding managing rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and when to let your doctor know. And although,\u00a0\nthe cause of rosacea is still unknown, experts\u00a0\u00a0 believe that the following factors may contribute:\u00a0\nHot drinks and spicy foods,Red wine, alcoholic\u00a0\u00a0 beverages, Temperature extremes, like going\u00a0\nfrom really cold to really hot or vice versa,\u00a0\u00a0 saunas, sunlight or wind, emotions, and even\u00a0\nvarious cosmetic products. Rosacea is more\u00a0\u00a0 common in females than males, and it usually\u00a0\ndevelops after the age of 30. And there is 4\u00a0\u00a0 types you should know of. You have ocular rosacea,\u00a0\nwhich includes eye redness and irritation and\u00a0\u00a0 swollen eyelids. Papulopustular rosacea, which\u00a0\nincludes flushing, swelling, and breakouts that\u00a0\u00a0 resemble acne. Erythemato-telangi-ectatic\u00a0\nrosacea which includes skin discoloration,\u00a0\u00a0 flushing, and visible blood vessels referred to\u00a0\nas spider veins, which you may have heard of. And\u00a0\u00a0 lastly, phymatous rosacea: which leads to bumpy\u00a0\nskin, often accompanied with an enlargement of the\u00a0\u00a0 nose and spider veins can be present too. Although\u00a0\nNo specific test is used to diagnose rosacea. You\u00a0\u00a0 should let your doctor know of the history of\u00a0\nyour symptoms so they can look at your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and rule out other conditions that\u00a0\ncould exist, such as psoriasis,\u00a0\u00a0 eczema, or lupus as the signs and symptoms may\u00a0\nlook alike. If your symptoms involve your eyes,\u00a0\u00a0 your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist\u00a0\n(ophthalmologist) for further evaluation.\u00a0 Now lets look at some treatment option and what\u00a0\ncan you do. Before I go into home remedies you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out starting today, its best to\u00a0\nlet your doctor know of your condition,\u00a0\u00a0 as they most likely will recommend topical\u00a0\nproducts that reduce redness, and can possibly\u00a0\u00a0 be more advantageous, especially if you haven\u2019t\u00a0\ntried them out before. Brimonidine or (Mirvaso)\u00a0\u00a0 and oxymetazoline or (Rhofade) reduce redness\u00a0\nby constricting blood vessels and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 results within 12 hours after use. The\u00a0\neffect on the blood vessels is temporary,\u00a0\u00a0 so the medication needs to be applied regularly to\u00a0\nmaintain improvements. Other topical products have\u00a0\u00a0 less effect on the redness but help control\u00a0\nthe pimples of mild rosacea.These include\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid and metronidazole and take up to\u00a0\n6 weeks to show improvement. Your doctor may\u00a0\u00a0 also prescribe antibiotic such as doxycycline or\u00a0\nOracea for moderate to severe rosacea with bumps\u00a0\u00a0 and pimples. ANd if if your rosacea is severe\u00a0\nand nothing else helps, your doctor may suggest\u00a0\u00a0 isotretinoin which is a powerful oral acne drug\u00a0\nthat also helps clear up acne like lesions of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea or can recommend Laser therapy and other\u00a0\nlight-based therapies to help reduce all that\u00a0\u00a0 redness. Now lets look at what you can do until\u00a0\nthen. There are 5 things you can starting now.\u00a0 #1: Identify and avoid triggers. Pay\u00a0\nattention to what tends to flare you up\u00a0\u00a0 and do your best to avoid them. For some that may\u00a0\nbe avoiding certain foods, hot drinks, alcohol,\u00a0\u00a0 and spicy foods. Eating foods that contain\u00a0\nthe compound cinnamaldehyde, such as cinnamon,\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate, tomatoes, and citrus may be culprits\u00a0\nas well. So pay attention to food triggers.\u00a0 #2 Protect your face. You want to make sure\u00a0\nthat if your exposed to the sun for long\u00a0\u00a0 periods of time, that you Use a broad-spectrum\u00a0\nsunscreen \u2014 which blocks both uv A and uv B\u00a0\u00a0 rays \u2014 with an SPF of 30 or higher. Because\u00a0\nso many sunscreens contain chemicals that can\u00a0\u00a0 be absorbed and cause irritation like octinoxate,\u00a0\noctosalate, or octocrylene you want to avoid these\u00a0\u00a0 chemical sunscreens and opt for a physical one\u00a0\nlike zinc oxide. I left one that i commend in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, so definitely check that out.\u00a0\nAlso on that note, if you live a colder climate:\u00a0\u00a0 try to cover your face in cold weather as this\u00a0\nis known to trigger rosacea as well. #3 Treat\u00a0\u00a0 your skin gently. Don't rub or touch your face\u00a0\nexcessively. Use a nonsoap cleanser and moisturize\u00a0\u00a0 frequently. Avoid products that contain alcohol\u00a0\nor other skin irritants or comedogenic products\u00a0\u00a0 that block the oil and sweat gland openings. I\u00a0\nleft more information on that below too, so check\u00a0\u00a0 that out. #4. clean your eyelids at least once\u00a0\na day if you have blepharitis, otherwise known\u00a0\u00a0 as an eyelid inflammation occurring at the base\u00a0\nof the eyelid. And if youre unsure that you do,\u00a0\u00a0 have your doctor examine your eyelids. Using a\u00a0\nwarm compress loosens the crust and has been shown\u00a0\u00a0 to help tremendously. People who have dandruff\u00a0\nare more likely to develop blepharitis. So Keeping\u00a0\u00a0 the dandruff under control can help reduce the\u00a0\nsymptoms, which can in theory help reduce rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 symptoms as well. #5 Makeup. Some makeup products\u00a0\nand techniques may help reduce the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0 skin redness. Try powder cosmetics with a green\u00a0\ntone and matte finish. I left one as well in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, that has seemed to help others.\u00a0\nSo check that out too. Does it have to be green?\u00a0\u00a0 Green is opposite of red on the color wheel, so\u00a0\nit's perfect for hiding any redness on your face.\u00a0 Now lets look at one of the most effective ways\u00a0\nto prevent it. Which is stress management. For\u00a0\u00a0 those who experience flare-ups as a result\u00a0\nof stress, stress management is an important\u00a0\u00a0 factor in managing your rosacea symptoms. hile\u00a0\nwe may not always know the cause of our stress,\u00a0\u00a0 we do know what relaxes us. Whether it\u00a0\nis reading a book at the end of the day,\u00a0\u00a0 going for a long walk at lunch hour, or\u00a0\neven calling a loved one just to say hello,\u00a0\u00a0 there are little things that we can choose to\u00a0\ndo each day that will help us better manage our\u00a0\u00a0 emotions and have a positive effect on our skin.\nI hope this video was useful to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 and that I hope you do share this video with\u00a0\nsomeone you know who can benefit from it. I also\u00a0\u00a0 hope that you gain just a little bit more control\u00a0\nover your rosacea flare ups. Like the video,\u00a0\u00a0 if you did enjoy it and subscribe to stay on\u00a0\nboard with all my other weekly health and wellness\u00a0\u00a0 videos.

        "transcript": "ocular rosacea is a type of rosacea that affects the eyelids and can cause serious implications for the eye so ocularization's inflammation that causes redness burning and itching of the eyes and it often develops in people who have skin rosacea as well which is a chronic skin condition that affects the face sometimes ocular or eye rosacea is the first sign that you may later develop the facial type of rosacea and so in today's video as a dry eye specialist I'm going to guide you through what ocular rosacea is and what can be done about it thank you welcome back to ischool with me Dr D where I teach you about products and treatments related to dry eye syndrome and eye Beauty so that you can have healthy beautiful and comfortable eyes give a little love tap on that subscribe button to stay up to date with all the latest tips and tricks I have for you because I have videos every single week and they're all about dry eye and Beauty so ocularization primarily affects adults between the ages of 30 and 50. it seems to develop in people who tend to blush and flush very easily meaning they get really red cheeks with exercise or even without just like a lot of reddening of the cheeks there's no actual cure for ocularization but medications and a good eye care routine can help control the signs and symptoms the main cause of ocularization well it's really interesting there are so many causes of rosacea there are so many things that impact how your rosacea expresses itself when it gets worse when it gets better and so I think there's really a lot to that but we're gonna go through those causes now the signs and symptoms of ocularization can precede the skin symptoms meaning you can have the eye symptoms first you can have your eye symptoms along with your skin symptoms or you might never have ocular rosacea even if you have skin rosacea but the symptoms of having ocularization can include redness of your eyes burning of your eyes itching watering feeling like your eyes are dry or gritty we call that feeling sometimes foreign body Sensation that means it feels like there's something in your eye all the time you can also have just blurred vision in fact oftentimes early on in ocular rosacea and dry eye syndrome my patients will just have fluctuating and blurred vision like if your vision gets better every single time you blink that's typically a tear film issue and may be due to dry eye you can also have sensitivity to light which we call photophobia photophobia is just um gosh like really sense instead of the light when you weren't before and that can happen as the initial sign of dry eye again a poor tear film can cause some of these symptoms you can also have really dilated small blood vessels on the warp white part of your eye that are visible when you look in the mirror so if you're looking at your conjunctiva or the white part of your eye the sclera and you're seeing more redness than before it can be a sign of ocularization you can also have the same thing on your eyelids if you look really really really close at your eyelids which might be difficult but you can see little red blood vessels cropping up along that lid margin those are called talangic tasias and are pretty indicative of ocular rosacea you also might have ocularization if you have recurrent eye or eyelid infections like having lots of pink eye conjunctivitis all the time you have blepharitis swollen Lids red Lids irritation or even chilesia coming back over and over and over chilesian dyes which I've done like honestly a thousand videos on but everybody searches it so there you go I I don't think they let you link 20 videos but I've done a million videos on styes so the severity of the ocularization symptoms though doesn't always match the severity of the skin symptoms so sometimes my patients will have worse dry eye and ocularization and sort of deny that they even have any skin symptoms at all or vice versa if patients with really bad skin symptoms and no eye symptoms or I also have patients that sort of tend to have both right now let's talk about triggers for ocularization because there's many things that have been pointed at in terms of causes and triggers we don't know the exact cause just like with skin rosacea we really don't know but it can be due to one or more factors it can be due to heredity environmental factors there can be bacterial involvement or you know loss of Skin Barrier issues with the microbiome on the skin block glands in the eyelids eyelid eyelash mites so we're talking about Demodex mites again I did a whole video on those but they have been pointed as being part of the root cause of rosacea at times there's some research that has shown a possible link between skin rosacea and helicobacter pylori bacteria which is the same bacteria that causes gastrointestinal infections and has been looked at in terms of causing ulcers as well there's certainly something to the whole gut skin brain axis you know they talk about sort of that microbiome connection so that's been pointed as well as a potential cause of rosacea there's a number of factors that can aggravate or trigger skin rosacea and they can aggravate or trigger ocular rosacea as well so we're talking about things like eating hot foods spicy foods and beverages alcohol Dairy sunlight wind or temperature extremes even emotions like stress anger or embarrassment strenuous exercise hot baths or saunas a patient who has a um sauna I just said it yeah like a dry sauna at his house and I can tell when I'm doing his IPL and he's been in that sauna because of sort of like rosaceous worsened we see more challenges more blood vessels popping up so there's other risk factors as well ocular rosacea is common in people with skin rosacea obviously that makes sense although you can have it without the skin being involved and skin rosacea affects more women than men although it affects both and ocularization affects men and women equally I don't know if that's so true I think it's also fair to say like you know my next sentence is well it's also more common in fair-skinned people and I think you know we would probably most of us would agree we see rosacea Moore and fair-skinned people but I think unfortunately sometimes when you get up into the fits types four five and six because of skin tone maybe it's not as easy to recognize certainly you're going to recognize those vascular changes um even those acneic changes the redness you're going to see it on really fair skin you're not going to see it as easily on darker skin types and so it may be underrepresented in the fits types four five and six so in terms of complications and what does it actually do so ocular rosacea can affect the surface of your eye especially your cornea your tear film particularly if you end up having dry eyes from the evaporation of the tears so rosacea tends to affect sebaceous glands meibomian glands are derived from sebaceous glands and they secrete oil my patients with ocular rosacea have poor oil within their meibomian glands and then they have all these talingic tasias on their lid margin it's a chronic progressive thing dry eye is so and 86 percent of dry eye has been shown to have and on meibomian gland dysfunction component we know that having poor oil gives you poor tears we know that having poor tears and not having the oil to coat and protect your tears leads to chronic inflammation of the entire ocular surface we also know from toyos's work that Celine dictages on your eyelids on your face even are associated with an increased level of interleukin 17 and 6 on the ocular surface and that's the whole pathophysiology of why IPL works because IPL reduces talangectages on your eyelids on your face itself and because you're reducing those you're reducing inflammation on the ocular surface and so ovular rosacea it's a very convoluted like process but basically it's an issue with these glands you don't have good oil glands if you don't have good oil glands you don't have good tears in general that can lead to an evaporation of the aqueous component of your tears it then leads to changes into your Chemistry right so now we have tears that have a different osmolarity than they should different concentration of all kinds of different things proteins there's inflammation present so again it's like this whole inflammatory Cascade that then can result in issues with your tear film which oh by the way your tear film's job is to make your vision clear and be the first refractive surface and protect your cornea and so now your cornea which is really really full of nerve fibers is sustaining damage as well epithelial damage the epithelium is that top layer of the cornea and so that cornea become irritated now there's other things that happen too with long-term ocularization I have a patient in his 80s that has had ocularization his whole life obviously treatments were really not there for most of his life and so at this point he has a lot of what's called trachiasis so lashes that grow the wrong way now what does that have to do with your oil glands well if you have poor oil glands and inflammation within the eyelid over time and I'm not taking this from a study this is just something I've noticed clinically the lashes change right so the Lash follicle seems to be affected too by chronic low-grade inflammation of the eyelid margin dropping out of meibomian glands glands that don't move at all that are dying out now the Lash follicle which is adjacent is changing as well we can get misdirected lashes we can get lashes that are falling out and misdirected lashes can poke your cornea I'll show you a picture of one here it's painful your cornea is full of all of these nerve endings it's potentially already degraded from a poor tear film from ocularization and now on top of it you got lashes growing the wrong way and it's poking your cornea so anyway that's kind of what happens to the ocular surface and why it's so so important to intervene and try and get better oil secretion but we'll get to that so let's get back to like what can you do the best diet for ocular rosacea is really the best diet for rosacea in general avoiding spicy foods hot beverages alcohol things like that there are many many reported dietary triggers and so you really have to individualize that I would say you'd almost have to take a diary of when your rosacea is worse and try to figure out what your triggers are so that you can identify those in a directed fashion rather than just never eating the things you love just because I said that they might be a trigger now there are some foods that can improve rosacea so fresh fruits an important aspect of treating rosacea with food is to try to remember to pick foods that have anti-inflammatory properties this is an inflammatory disease so fresh organic fruits not only have anti-inflammatory properties but also contain a high amount of antioxidants so you know things we love like blueberries pomegranate all of these are great to help prevent damage on a cellular level another type of food is fatty fish so I'll link to the Ziggler's fish oil product here fatty fish also contain anti-inflammatory properties because they have high levels of zinc and omega-3 fatty acids both zinc and omega-3 fatty acids help to inhibit pro-inflammatory Pathways and help block inflammation omega-3 fatty acids can also help to prevent dry eye symptoms in people with ocularization so this is a huge go-to one great source of omega-3 fatty acids are flax seeds and walnuts in your diet but it's often difficult to get enough and so again linking Ziggler's product supplementing with a high quality pharmaceutical grade fish oil is a great idea I love PRN Pharmaceuticals I love Nordic Naturals and I love the hydrate brand omega-3 as well turmeric is a spice it's derived from a plant out of India curcumalanga I don't know how to say these things but basically the plant's known for its anti-inflammatory properties one theory is that an active compound within turmeric called curcumin contributes to its anti-inflammatory capabilities you will see turmeric pop up in dry eye supplements there's a number of supplements that contain it next we have fermented foods so it was found that bacterial overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract May worsen rosacea and that patients with rosacea are more prone to gastrointestinal infections that's that gut skin brain health connection right I'm an eye doctor that's not really my area but there's something to that there was a study that found that when gastrointestinal imbalances were treated with probiotics the severity of the participants rosacea was reduced in addition to probiotic supplements fermented foods are full of probiotics that may be beneficial to keep gut bacteria in Balance to help prevent the infections and the rosacea flare-ups so examples of delicious and nutritious fermented foods would include like miso kefir kombucha love kombucha would also recommend high fiber vegetables so Bland vegetables can also help to improve rosacea by helping to prevent bacterial overgrowth vegetables like leafy greens asparagus and legumes like lentils can help to create an environment that allows for good gut bacteria to grow and diversify you also want to avoid starches and refined sugars which will help to prevent gut bacterial overgrowth so how do you get diagnosed with this well there's no specific tests or procedures to diagnose ocularization per se usually eye doctors are making a diagnosis based upon your symptoms your medical history and then just kind of looking at your eyes and eyelids and the skin of your face I would say for me as a dry specialist a dead giveaway is the quality of the um my bum and then the talangectages on the lid margin point me in that Direction ocular rosacea can usually be controlled with medication and home care but it doesn't cure the condition and so it tends to be very chronic your doctor might prescribe things like oral antibiotic we'll use things like tetracycline doxycycline erythromycin and Minocycline these are antibiotics used in low doses it is not for the antibiotic effect it's actually for the secondary effect of thinning out the oils and so many patients with ocularization will find themselves especially on doxycycline and doxycycline over time can help the oil glands in my opinion you also need the oil glands to be unblocked and expressed but I digress for a severe disease you might take an antibiotic for a longer time so I've had patients before that took doxycycline for months if not years of course working on your diet is really important healthy foods healthy fats probiotic rich foods identifying and tracking the foods and drinks that you consume assume that seem to trigger or soothe your symptoms can be a really good move as well so in terms of ocularization Doxycycline is not it I think it's really important to control what's going on on your face it's really important to have an eye wash and a face wash that control your bacterial populations in your Demodex population so I'll link the Ziggler's tea tree oil washes and eyelid scrubs I think that's critically important doxy can be very helpful low-dose Naltrexone can be helpful as well Dr toyos makes a video about it I plan to make a video about it in the next few months and more than anything IPL and light based therapies along with expression of your meibomian glands when patients have ocularization they don't make good oil they make sort of thicker oil they have all these blood vessels nothing works like IPL works I intense pulse light was founded or found by Dr toyos when he was treating rosacea patients finding that they're dry I got better at least that's what I've always heard that is the mechanism the mechanism is that it's attracted to pigment it's attracted to blood vessels it takes care of blood vessels it gets them gone thereby reducing inflammation at the ocular surface it also helps control bacterial levels it also helps kill Demodex mites IPL works so well for ocular rosacea we also have the other light based therapies like low-level light therapy and then expressing the glands if you have oil that's been backed up for 30 years if you have oil glands that are going away literally shortening appear to be empty don't appear appear to be there anymore you've got to do something to wake them back up if they're not already gone so you know things like gland probing and expressing the glands is critically important so that's it about ocularization I've also made another video about ocularization I've also made tons and tons and tons of videos so you can go down the rabbit hole please do on my bromine gland dysfunction and Demodex and all of it it's a good time so I hope I answered all your questions about ocularization treatment triggers diet and causes and even though it can't be cured it can be managed most often very successfully so make sure to find yourself a dry specialist you know like and trust and leave me comments below if I can fill in anything else about ocularization thanks so much for watching Today class is dismissed and I'll see you next time foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "would you believe me if i tell you that the mites on your face are causing these red angry looking bums also known as rosacea hi friends i'm chris and i'm a dermatology trainee working in the west of scotland in the uk and in this video i'm going to dive straight into the topic rosacea specifically we're going to cover what it is how it looks like as well as the various steps and treatments we can do to help prevent and manage this common skin condition we are also going to touch on the things that you can do to help with your skin as well as the various treatment options we have in dermatology in the uk so what on earth is rosacea well this is a very common skin condition predominantly affecting the middle age groups as well as people with fair skin we don't exactly know what causes this but it is thought to be due to a combination of genes environmental factors as well as an overabundance of a type of mite also known as the demodex mites now these are small little creatures that love growing and crawling around the hair follicles and it's actually present in every single one of us however in people with rosacea it is thought that they are more sensitive to these mites and thereby causing inflammation of the skin leading to flushing and redness rosacea can also be triggered by a variety of things which i've listed in this video and the most common trigger that we see in our clinics is actually direct sunlight and this is why we always advise our patients to wear sunscreen at all times to help prevent rosacea there are of course other known triggers such as caffeine in your tea coffee alcohol spicy food and even exercise and it's actually really anything that makes your blood vessels beneath the skin dilate causing the flushing and redness you see in rosacea now i think it's important for us to classify the rosacea into various subtypes as they can look quite different and also the treatments for each subtype can be different as well one of the commonest subtype of rosacea is the erythematolangitic rosacea also known as the vascular rosacea this can be quite a mouthful to pronounce but essentially patients presents with flushing redness of the face and telangiectasia which also means dilated blood vessels now the flushing is usually temporary at the start but as the rosacea worsens it can become permanent the other very common subtype of rosacea is the papillopascillar rosacea also known as the inflammatory rosacea and in this subtype patients get this angry looking red bumps also known as papules and pasteurs which are essentially papules containing parts inside now i think it is important for us to identify papillopascular variant of rosacea as they can look quite similar to acne vulgaris and so you may ask how do i actually tell the difference well essentially the triggers for rosacea don't necessarily exacerbate acne the other important thing to note is that the lesions for rosacea typically affect the central face so this would include the forehead both cheeks the nose and the chin and they typically spare the temples and the sides of the jawline of the face lastly in rosacea we don't normally get the white or blackheads that you see in acne and these are also known as comedomes which are basically clogged up hair follicles now the other two subtypes are not as common but we do still see them in our practice one of them is called the ocular rosacea and as the name suggests ocular meaning eye patients with this type of rosacea typically get eye symptoms such as burning itching and grittiness of the eyes and if this is left unchecked and untreated it can cause permanent scarring and so it is important for you to seek help quite early on so that you can get the appropriate management the last subtype is the phymatus rosacea also known as rhinophyma now this subtype is particularly difficult to treat and essentially means thickening and deformity of the skin particularly affecting the nose so your usual creams gels lotion and potions that you use to treat rosacea probably wouldn't work for this subtype of rosacea and you may need more aggressive treatments like laser therapies and even surgery so now you may ask how do we treat rosacea the important thing for any subtype of rosacea is to identify and potentially avoid or limit any triggers triggering rosacea what i'll recommend is to keep a diary for anything that can exacerbate your rosacea and try to limit or cut down one trigger at a time you don't have to be prescriptive about this because ultimately it is your quality of life we are talking about and it's all about weighing the pros and cons when it comes to avoiding things you may like so for example if your rosacea is triggered by eating spicy food and you just so happen to love spicy food and you eat spicy food every single time it is probably quite difficult and even impossible for you to limit eating spicy food because it will just make you very miserable so instead of avoiding things completely you may wish to perhaps limit the amount of exposure and be more rigorous when it comes to your skin care regime another important thing you can do is to treat your skin as though it is super sensitive always always remember to wear a good sunscreen as we know sunlight is the number one trigger for rosacea wearing sunscreen not only prevents rosacea it also helps reduce the risk of skin cancer and slows down aging another tip is to use non-fragrance and non-comedogenic facial cleansers and moisturizers which help protect the skin berry function try to find cleansers that are more acidic with a ph similar to the skin so between four to five rather than harsh soaps which are more alkaline and can be quite irritating and traumatic to the skin an example you can try is the serraphy hydrating facial cleanser another important tip is to keep your skin care as simple as possible now for patients who have sensitive skin who are more prone to getting acne and rosacea i would advise against using toner because toner can actually strip off the essential oils and moisture in your skin making it more inflamed so for specific subtypes like for example the erythematologic rosacea other than the advice that i've given before and doctors in the uk can also prescribe a topical gel called movaso gel which contains bromonidin 0.03 now this is licensed and indicated for facial redness and flushing and we typically advise patients to use once a day the only issue with this gel is that it can cause rebound redness when it's stopped and so it's often quite difficult when patients try to come off it another treatment that we can offer in the uk is an oral medication called propranolol which helps to shrink down any dilated blood vessels now as you can imagine this is an oral tablet so it can cause systemic side effects such as slowing your heart rate down and so this is something that we don't normally prescribe in the uk for rosacea unless it is absolutely crucial also if your facial redness is permanent causing discomfort and psychological distress sometimes we can think of laser treatments for example ipl and housed dye laser the only thing is that i'm not exactly sure if these treatments are still available under the nhs which is the national health service for those people living in the uk as such and you may wish to consider going for these treatments privately but make sure that you seek out a reputable and recognized healthcare professional who knows what they are doing you may also wish to consider camouflage makeup with a green tinted base to help correct the redness and help even out the skin tone now in the uk there is a camouflage service provided by a charity called changing faces and this is something that you can register either yourself or get your gp to refer you onwards to this service and in this service what they do is that they would look at your skin tone show you the products that they use the different shades that would match your skin tone as well as how to apply the products now for people who are suffering from the papillopascular type of rosacea we do have a variety of treatments available for people who are suffering from mild to moderate symptoms we can offer topical treatments in the first instance and in the uk there are three mainstay topical treatments we offer the first one is ivamatin cream also known as cilantra which you can apply once a day to the affected areas for up to four months the other treatment is metronidazole gel also known as rosex gel which you can apply twice daily for up to four months and lastly we have the acelic acid 15 cream with the brand name being called phoenicia and we often ask patients to apply to their face twice a day for up to six months these treatments are typically prescribed by your healthcare professional in the uk but i think you can get the acelic acid treatments over the counter through brands like the ordinary products choice as well as natural once the rosacea is more well controlled you can then reduce the frequency down to once or twice a week as a form of maintenance therapy if your symptoms are more severe then we may consider a combination of oral antibiotic and the topical treatments and the oral antibiotics include things like lemon cycline and doxycycline now bear in mind this is a prescription only medication and so you may wish to speak to your healthcare professional like your gp or local dermatologist in your area to find out more the aim of using antibiotics is more for the anti-inflammatory properties rather than antibacterial and typically patients stay on the antibiotics for at least three months for it to actually work now if the symptoms continue to be persistent despite topical and oral antibiotics sometimes in dermatology we offer low-dose isotretinoin also known as roaccotin now this is a treatment similar to that for acne severe acne in fact but actually the dose used for rosacea is much lower than that used for acne now as for people suffering from the phymatis variant of rosacea and the topical treatments and as well as the or antibiotics they won't work because of the deformity and soft tissue swelling in this case sometimes we can refer you onwards to laser treatments as well as surgical interventions to help remove the excess soft tissue and as far as i know these services are still available in some health boards across the uk so you may wish to speak to your local dermatologist to find out more now for people who are suffering from eye symptoms or ocular rosacea other than minimizing the aggravating factors like for example excessive central heating excessive air conditioning and even smoky environments i think it is important for you to make sure that you keep your eyelids as clean as possible this means cleaning them with a cotton wool soaked in warm water and if you get sticky bits underneath your eyelids you can wash them with using baby shampoo also if your eyes get dry you can buy over the counter lubricating eye drops and try to go for the ones without preservatives to keep your eyes moisturized throughout the day one thing that people don't realize is that sometimes medications can exacerbate eye dryness so have a look at your regular medications particularly if you are on a lot of regular medications such as certain antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications as they can sometimes exacerbate eye dryness in dermatology we sometimes use all antibiotics to help dampen down inflammation but if your eye symptoms are very bad and severe we can refer to our ophthalmology colleagues in the eye clinic for their review as well now before i close off this video i just want to say that oftentimes we underestimate how distressing skin conditions can be for people i know that it is not the same as say if someone suffers a stroke or a heart attack rosacea is not life-threatening but they can cause a huge impact on our daily activities and social life skin conditions can make you look and feel different from the people around you and this ultimately can cause you to lose confidence in yourself and cause self-esteem issues i just want to say that for anyone who is watching this video suffering from any skin condition no matter how severe or mild it may be and if you are suffering from this and please don't suffer this alone speak to someone about it and get help as soon as possible there are tons of support groups online and that can help support you through this journey i myself suffered from really bad severe acne and this had caused significant long-term scarring which i still have to this day and so i hope by doing these videos i would empower you guys including healthcare professionals and with the necessary tools and knowledge in tackling of these skin conditions at an early stage i will also provide several links down in the description box below which you may want to check out if you want to read out more about rosacea and if you're interested to know more about skin conditions in general do check out my video on keratosis polaris where i talk about another very common skin condition that pretty much almost everyone suffers from thank you for watching see you later bye",

(laughing) She's a bad patient! I know, I know. The hot, the jalapenos, I can eat these. I just love them. Me too. That's bad for your nose? They make nose acne worse. They make your nose red, they flare your rosacea, they do, so they're a sometimes to know so I'm going to stick them over here. I'm really glad I don't have zits on my nose, because I'm not giving up that, either. This salsa, if it's really spicy. Same deal. (audience saying awww) It's a no. Okay, well, just live with zits on your nose. Coffee and tea, they're a no. My nose, okay, that's pretty much my entire daily diet. My nose should've straight up fallen off my face. And she has a really cute nose. I'm looking right at it. A long time ago! I want you to do Omega-3s, like better in salmon. That's really gonna help you. I don't really like salmon, but I'll trade it for some halibut. And then, Brussels sprouts are really, really good. Sincerely, can we use any seafood? Because I don't love cooked salmon. I like salmon... And so, Omega-3s in salmon or other cooked seafood, yeah. So, I can eat other fish and get my Omega-3s. Exactly. It's not the only fish. Absolutely not. And any cruciferous vegetable or just Brussels sprouts, specifically? Any cruciferous vegetable is fine. They're all good for your skin? They're all good for your skin, yeah.

        "published_at": "2021-09-16T00:00:05Z",
        "transcript": "did you know that having rosacea can cause dry eyes and that there's even a recognized form of the disease called ocular rosacea ocular rosacea has a detrimental and even devastating effect on the ocular surface resulting in symptoms of dryness irritation discomfort and if you suffer from it you know how debilitating it can be in today's video we'll briefly go over rosacea and then get into some things you can do for the control of it to benefit your eyes welcome to ischool with dr d where my goal is to arm you with the knowledge you need to take control of your eye health and have the best vision possible like and subscribe for videos every week you've made it to ischool with me dr d welcome make yourself comfy because today we're learning about rosacea especially ocular rosacea before we get started this channel is all about education and i love creating this community of pupils if you've got a friend or family member relative that this information could help this video is easily shared right here from youtube so rosacea is a skin disease that affects the sebaceous glands and causes the face to flush it can also manifest as acne looking spots on the nose cheeks chin or forehead often this facial rosacea will affect the eyes common symptoms of ocular rosacea include redness burning and watering of the eyes or even foreign body sensation that's a medical term for feeling like you've got something in your eyes you can have clogging of the glands in your eyelids thickening of your eyelids redness and swelling of your lids and the base of your lashes i made a whole video about mgd that you can check out here but one of the things ocular rosacea causes many times is mgd when you have ocular rosacea you can even have recurrent schilasians or styes so it's possible to have facial rosacea only ocular rosacea only or a combination of the two which in my experience is the most common i've also seen patients who begin with facial rosacea and later develop ocular symptoms or vice versa so it's really going to depend on the person your experience with rosacea the actual cause of rosacea is unknown it's possible that there's a genetic component and it's also possible that environmental triggers could be bringing it on some researchers point to demodex mites as the cause others postulate that it's uh helicobacter pylori h pylori the same one that they point their finger at for stomach ulcers but the reality is we just don't have it a hundred percent pinned down just yet so in terms of preventing a rosacea flare it's often quoted that you should avoid extreme environments like really really hot environments really cold a lot of wind can make it worse we also know that it can worsen with physical exertion so again kind of getting overheated lots of physical exertion you can have more redness it's also very much something that will respond to the foods you eat so i made a home remedy for dry eye video and all of those concepts apply here you want to avoid alcohol really spicy foods hot coffee or tea because you'll find that there are commonalities in your diet you may want to keep a food diary of when you have rosacea flares and try to figure out which foods are the triggers for your rosacea flares because there definitely are things that will make it worse especially like spicy foods alcohol that kind of thing we also have stress you know stress definitely affects it then times of high stress your body tends to get more inflamed in general and that comes out in different ways for different people but it's very possible for that to affect your rosacea and then you also have to be mindful of your makeup and skin care when it comes to rosacea because certain skin care will exacerbate the issue the same with makeup and remember i've talked about on this channel before but here in the u.s especially our fda does not ban a lot of ingredients in makeup and skin care and so we as the consumers have to be really careful flipping that label over and looking what's in there because there are a lot of preservatives and things that are banned in europe that we're allowed to have in our makeup and skin care here in the u.s and those can be causing rosacea flares as well so how are we going to treat rosacea well i'm not a dermatologist and so if you have rosacea i think you should probably be under the care of a dermatologist right so for your facial rosacea in terms of the ocular rosacea component however as a dry eye specialist this is something i treat all the time and there's actually a lot of overlap between what i'm doing for the eyes and what the dermatologists are doing for the skin so one of the first treatments is a low-dose oral antibiotic like doxycycline so if you're not pregnant or nursing and you're over you're not developing anymore basically if you're an adult you can take doxycycline and that course is usually one to two months long now we're not taking the doxycycline for its antibiotic effects so much as we're taking it for its secondary effect of changing the oil glands and thinning them down and helping with meibomian gland dysfunction the second thing we can do are steroid drops and ointments those really help with inflammation but i would consider steroids to be pretty short term it's not something you want to have to be on for a long time because steroids taken topically in the eye can cause cataracts decreased healing and problems with glaucoma or high eye pressure we also have antibiotic drops in ointments especially if your lid margins are infected with that really thick oil that often happens in ocular rosacea and those can be administered like i said by drop or ointment lid scrubs are also very effective this is a disease that affects those lid margins and so lid scrubs are going to help cleanse the lid margin reduce the biofilm that's there we can also use sprays like avenova to reduce that bacterial count on the lid margin warm compresses i'll link my video here but they're really nice and useful for ocular rosacea meibomian gland dysfunction i have a video about membomine gland dysfunction as well that you can check out artificial tears here's my video my top five artificial tears but when you have ocular rosacea you're more prone to having dryness so being on top of artificial tears especially non-preserved is a really good idea and then finally ipl and thermal heat and expression so these are in the category of in-office treatments ipl is called intense pulse light video right here and i love ipl because it actually is indicated for facial rosacea ipl actually came about in eye care after being used by dermatologists for the last 15 or 20 years to treat facial rosacea and dermatologists were finding that their patients would their dry eye was getting better when they treated the facial rosacea it helped with the dry eye that's because believe it or not extra blood vessels that show up on your face when you have facial rosacea are contributing to inflammation on your ocular surface specifically interleukin 17 in interleukin-6 show up on the ocular surface as a result of these extra blood vessels on your face and so what ipl does it's a light treatment that targets pigment when we get rid of those extra blood vessels we get rid of the inflammation and so if you have rosacea and you've not considered ipl you've got to consider ipl it will help your skin with tone it will help the blood vessels and the redness that you see but really importantly i mean those are aesthetic benefits but it really really really really helps with dry eye and then there's thermal heat and expression i've done videos about tear care before but this is you know when you have rosacea you have a dysfunction of the glands the meibomian glands get thick and so we can use heat and expression to get those glands loosened up and to pull that oil out so that you can make new butter oil so that we can unclog the glands so they can help with your tears an itch okay so if you pay attention to your triggers and you have a good at-home routine it's within reason to get your rosacea flares under control if you've been diagnosed with ocular rosacea let me know what's helped your condition the most down in the comments below that's it for today's ischool lesson i hope you enjoyed it thanks for attending class today and i will see you next time",

        "published_at": "2023-02-03T17:00:28Z",
        "transcript": "in this video I am taking you into the drugstore with me to shop for three over the counter and affordable solutions for mild to moderate rosacea these are my three must-have products I'm Dr Marin Locke the budget dermatologist subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want advice for real skin and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist so rosacea it's an inflammatory skin condition that causes redness on the face and sometimes it comes along with acne-like bumps as well dermatologists will call these little bumps papules and pustules there are also more severe subtypes of rosacea like fimidus rosacea but for this video I am teaching you how to treat the redness and the bumps of rosacea and you do not have to break the bank to do it as always just a little disclaimer see a dermatologist for your skin condition to make sure you actually have the correct diagnosis and to get a personalized treatment plan for you this here is just general advice for educational purposes only so that you know your options and can ask educated questions to your health care provider okay so in order to understand my recommendations for rosacea and why these products really work let me explain to you a couple things about the causes of your rosacea and we need to talk about your skin care routine as well you must get your skincare routine on point I will show you some good options while we are inside the drugstore so your rosacea is caused not by just one thing it's likely the result of several things going on at once first genetics can't change that two an off-balance microbiome that has led to an overgrowth of harmful organisms on your face that are likely crowding out the good bacteria and microorganisms this drives inflammation that leads to redness and the bumps of rosacea there is some evidence suggesting a link between gut health and skin Health which means what is going on in our gut can be driving the skin disease like rosacea and unlike genetics this is something that we can change dietary changes for root cause treatment for starters and medications both topical and oral that can knock back the bad microorganisms on the skin so it can make room for a healthier balance of the helpful microorganisms I have affordable topical treatment options for this in this video that you can get without a prescription the third cause external factors can be driving or worsening your rosacea this includes the things that you are doing to your skin to cause a persistence or Flair of your rosacea this may be that you are just using the wrong skin care products or maybe excessive UV exposure certain foods exercise and even other environmental factors like temperature chain changes so if you are predisposed to having rosacea you need to be very aware of your triggers so that you can minimize your flares and you also need to be very diligent about a proper skin care routine with the majority of your products focusing on protecting and strengthening your Skin Barrier I cannot stress this enough I will teach you how so my first recommendation in the drugstore is to shop for a product with sulfur in it like this one by prozacia this can be found in the medication section of the drugstore and also online of course I have this one Linked In the description of this video this is less than ten dollars for a really effective treatment so here's a quick tip when you are going to choose your product with rosacea in it turn it over and look at the ingredients label I want to see a section called active ingredients up top with sulfur listed there rather than a product with sulfur listed just in the inactive ingredients section this is a small distinction but it is important because a product that has inactive ingredients section means that the FDA has regulated and tested this as an actual medication not just a cosmetic product to beautify the Skin So this example by prozacia you can see has sulfur listed as an active ingredient this one has 10 sulfur in it which is a pretty concentrated dose so this option is going to to work very well to treat the bumps of rosacea because sulfur has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties it has been shown to cut down on pathogens like sea acnes some strep and staff species which are all implicated in causing rosacea it's also been shown to kill Demodex mites which are another possible cause of rosacea and it calms inflammation now one of the great benefits of sulfur is that it does not cause antibacterial resistance like topical and oral antibiotics can the downside is that some sulfur products can have a bit of an odor to them now my next recommendation is an azelaic acid product okay I love this one so much this is available over the counter in a strength of around 10 percent you can also get this treatment as a prescription in higher strengths around 15 to 20 percent but listen you can get improvement with the 10 option only my top recommendation is the azelaic acid Emulsion 10 by nigerium you can find this at Target or online for about twenty two dollars this one also has a couple other ingredients in it that will soothe your skin like niacinamide and Alan Towing so I find this one extremely tolerable for sensitive skin now I also will point out a really great one for a few dollars less and it's by the inky list the redness relief solution with 10 azelaic acid in it also containing 0.3 percent Allen toen again to soothe the skin this one is a little bit more simple and straightforward of a formula which I really like and I think that could be very beneficial for sensitive and rosacea prone skin so this is another great option to check out I have both of these linked below this azoleic acid ingredient is really going to work to improve your rosacea because it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in it that have been shown to reduce the inflammatory bumps of rosacea as well as the redness around those bumps so the results can actually be quite significant for the actual redness aspect of rosacea okay so those are my first two must-haves so far sulfur is going to be aimed mostly at the bumps of rosacea and the azaleaic acid is for the bumps and the redness of your skin the third drugstore must have for rosacea is going to be for redness reduction okay decreasing that redness on the skin and calming the inflammation that can sometimes worsen the look of your redness so here is my top pick this is event and High redness concentrate this is pricey but if you know my love for this brand you know that these products are worth it because their formulations are absolutely unmatched in this space so here is what makes this product unique compared to other moisturizers or topical products that say they will treat the redness of rosacea that you will see on the Shelf next to these this one is actually going to reduce the redness and soothe the skin decrease the swelling of the face that can sometimes be subtle but come along with rosacea it is set within a very nourishing base that is going to hydrate the skin and create this little subtle protective layer over the Skin Barrier which is absolutely key here so this one is actually a leave on product but it actually comes in a cleansing lotion which I love as well I'm going to link both of those below now event has some great sales throughout the year so if this is just outside of your budget look out for a sale I always share d details of these on my Instagram so now while we are at the drugstore let's grab some of those skincare Essentials that will be restoring and protective to your rosacea prone skin remember you must make sure that all of the products you select are fragrance free here are my best recommendations for a cleanser choose the most gentle one you are not looking for a cleanser that is going to do a whole lot of treatment Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser is my absolute best budget pick it's less than ten dollars I get mine on Amazon usually around eight dollars it has a super simple formula and actually does a great job removing makeup dirt and oil from the face or another option is you can choose the Aveeno redness relief line they have a foaming cleanser that is soothing and it is free of all these harmful irritants that we want to make sure we avoid event like I mentioned has the anti-redness cleanser as well if you want to splurge but I don't think you have to splurge on a cleanser if you have rosacea save your budget for the treatment products instead now you're going to need a great moisturizer for rosacea now I do not love products that have hyaluronic acid in them if you have rosacea type skin so be careful choosing a moisturizer because that ingredient is often snuck in there my favorite my total top pick La Roche Posay double repair cream is my top pick another great option would be Aveeno calm plus restore redness relief moisturizing cream is another great option this one passes my test I like to use this at night time also Cetaphil makes a redness relieving moisturizer for daytime with mineral SPF in it and also a night cream version these are great and they are super affordable all of those options are also linked in the description of this video now I've also tried the roseliac intense visible facial redness Serum by La Roche Posay I like to pair that one with a moisturizer one of the options I mentioned just a minute ago would work fine this will give you a little extra hydration and soothing of the skin I do not think this one is as effective as the event anti-redness product but it does feel really nice and soothing on the skin not quite as drastic of a difference in terms of redness here though in my opinion it does have ambophenol which is a natural extract and it has neurosensing which can soothe the skin and create a great hydration barrier this formulation here overall is just a little bit lacking compared to the event but it is a little bit more affordable for you to check out and compare and last but certainly not least grab a sunscreen that is good for rosacea this might be a little of trial and error for you because rosacea skin is just tough like that but you want to make sure your sunscreen has 100 mineral filters and no chemical filters because those are known triggers of rosacea so here are some of my personal favorite great drugstore sunscreens for rosacea I love this one by CeraVe it's their hydrating mineral sunscreen there is also a tinted version of this and I love the one by La Roche Posay they're tinted mineral sunscreen but if you want to spin just a bit more I love the biosons squalane plus zinc Sheer Mineral option it is not tinted and it virtually goes on clear it's really soothing to the skin so there you go there are a lot of affordable treatment products for rosacea that you can get without a prescription right at the drugstore or online so rosacea is a really big topic and I'm happy to do more videos on the skin issue and show you more specific step-by-step rosacea skin care routines or how to cover rosacea with makeup just let me know what you have questions about and how I can help you and make sure you are subscribed to my YouTube channel and come say hi on Instagram and Tick Tock at the budget dermatologist see you soon foreign

        "transcript": "during this video I'm going to talk about a very severe chronic and recurrent skin infection that affects the face mainly the forehead the cheek the nose the chin it is a condition that looks very much inflamed patients are unable to face other people they leave their jobs their work it goes on for years and years patients are doing all the kinds of steroids ointments gels and natural drugs carbon laser IPL laser Sr laser different kinds of treatments but then realize after years and years of treatment that this is to be addressed internally because the internal system has to be cleansed and the siddhan the principle has to be known and accordingly the right treatment is important which is beautifully given in ayurved of course for severe conditions we do require authentic treatment as per the classics as per what is mentioned by acharyas in the same way we need a treatment to cure The Roots but nevertheless I will be sharing one internal and One external medicine that will help you from the first few days of its use itself so if you have acne or anyone else has acne do watch this till the end share this video further and make sure you use this video you follow this video and make sure you watch it till the end so let's understand about acne rosacea a chronic inflamed red skin infection how do you cure it from The Roots let's understand in this video [Music] Namaste everyone welcome to Jovi's Hospital of ayurved and aesthetic center Mumbai acne rosacea a completely inflamed skin condition it is happening all of a sudden because of hot climate it could be hot exposure it could be hot bath it could be you know we are as explained in ayurved pitha which means fire element heat inflammation what really increases the pitha let me give you an explanation in just three words excess consumption of SAR salty and spicy foods salty spicy if you increase and excessively consume these items High tendency of having such pitaj vikar or inflammatory conditions like acne rosacea patients suffer since years and years the nature of the diseases to reoccur again and again and Trouble the patient it has so much of redness that patients don't tend to go outside or talk to other people so patients have done all kinds of laser but still find failures just like every other skin condition now Jovi's Hospital of ayurveda has almost all the kinds of lasers for patients but lasers are meant to be used for beautification in most cases acne rosacea is not a condition which requires lasers because laser or chemical peel can aggravate the condition the main treatment the main you know root is the internal system if we do not treat the pitha the fire element the heat the inflammation whatever we call it we call it pitten ayurved since 5000 years complete success this results we see when this pith is addressed complete results are same the siddhan the principle in ayurveda is very very important and the shastra car the acharyas the you know ancient charias in the classical text explain it in just two words on the basis of these two siddhanta we see minimum 5000 herbs and 15 to 20 or 10 15 panchakarma is available just based on these two siddhant to cure this disease from the root cause although in very severe condition we need timely treatment repeated treatment because repeated episodes are seen in all these patients so acne rosacea chronic conditions small red you know white pus-filled acne very different from acne bulgaris it needs to be diagnosed timely we cannot misdiagnose and give a treatment for acne vulgaris because if you use a narifloxacin or a clindamycin we see how the infection increases further the redness increases for the extremely dry the skin gets so we don't want all of that over here we need to address it with ayurved beautiful results let me explain you what things you can follow internal can follow external to get the best best results so number one remedy number one medicine two ingredients first it is yashti madhu which is varnia which is best you know one of the best for skin it is great you know for brain tonic media and to improve the senses or the improve the strength of the skin is beautiful so very common medicine across the globe you will find it number one gesti madhu it also has the antifungal properties and it also helps in reducing the redness reducing any amount of discoloration that is there over the face so that's one thing second a very important famous and easily available it is hemidosmis indicus which is nothing but sariva beautiful antifungal and anti-bacterial properties it kills the bacteria it is a blood purifier itself and it is doing the rakta prasadam it is great when it comes to redness so yashti madhu and sariva mix it equal amounts store it in a container take a teaspoon apply a Face Pack wash it off after 15 minutes you can apply it once or twice a day face is oily applied with rose water another combination or you can combine this with kumkumadi tail if your skin is very very oily or you can go with the kumkumadi lip for external application ayurved has endless external applications right from durvadi growth to yesterday endless medicines to make sure this is cured simple one out here for you justi plus sariva as simple as that as natural and as suiting for each one of you yesterday that's it endless more combinations are there this is one that helps all patients number two coming to the internal medicine which is something which is most important before I share the remedy let me tell you that panchakarma is the need for such conditions we see that in ayurved this is not explained as a kushta kushta which means where the skin is worsening but the skin is smelling it is completely inflamed we call it kushta which means skin disorder so acne rosace is not completely explained but out of all the skin disorders that were explained years ago one of which we can relate to acne rosacea and when the same principles are applied we see complete cure which is in one word I will mentioned the heat inflammation fire element is something that we to reduce hence we need to have panchakarma's like the woman or the variation to remove the doshas through the upward root or the downward root to cleanse the body in the oldest and the most authentic way a simple remedy to share with all of you it is called as Avi patrika churna a very tasty medicine one teaspoon before bed is in general adult dose an ayurvedic practitioner can double or triple or manage the dose depending on the condition but the general dose is one teaspoon before bed available across the globe its main action is that it does it is mild purgative action it will only remove the high pith that is present in the body it will flush it out of the body in the next morning in a very easy simple and healthy manner not severely have you know loose tools or any of those patients are getting good relief although acne rosacea a very uh you know chronic condition needs a proper classical text treatment you know proper treatment so across the globe today we see active with India tablet we see activate India live see my tablet because liver your growth is the most so we need to work on the liver as well live see my tablet we also need to use certain anti-inflammatory ayurvedic herbs like the Sora C made syrup of active with India so tuxi lives we see for the care of the skin for the care of the liver live for the care of the Sora skin we need to use such ayurvedic proprietary extracts which cures these from the root cause this is used by doctors across the globe today although a combination treatment plus along with this and panchakarma is planned along with this we see beautiful results of with the karma we see beautiful results of Agni Karma woman viration of rakta mukshan which is either ceraved of jaloka ucharan different different kinds of combination treatments are there in ayurved to cure it from The Roots seriousness continuation and proper timely medicines are important to cure it out here in this video number one sariva Manchester lip external and second it is endless medicines which are doing there is chandrakala Ras there is do not take all these you know medicine names because this needs to be consumed under proper practitioner one cannot self-medicate at least with these formulations but to just conclude that endless amount of combinations are available in ayurved to work it out timely treatment timely changes in the treatment are required make sure you choose ayurved before it's too late and even if it's too late ayurveda shorts good results when it comes to such inflammatory conditions this is all for now any doubts question let us know in the comment section

well as president of the new age skin Research Foundation Dr Fox is a leading Authority in the field of Dermatology and an official spokesperson for the American Academy of Dermatology as well as a former board member for the national rosacea Foundation thank you very much for being with us Dr Fox thank you Cindy for inviting me today we will be discussing rosacea a condition that affects over 14 million Americans Dr Fox what exactly is rosace first of all I Cindy I think it's so important that we're highlighting this very prevalent condition rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease that tends to affect people generally between ages 35 to 50 and it's often with papules pules and and diffuse redness of the face it can affect the eyes it's mostly on the mid facial area what exactly causes rosacea Dr Fox while there is no known cause there have been many theories one of the theories is that it was caused by microorganisms whether a helico Bor or whether it's caused by a Demodex ficuum these mostly have fallen into disfavor and they're not thought to be the cause now however there are cases where people have had these and they've treated these microorganisms and it has improved and perhaps in some way they are responsible some other people think it's a de degenerative collagen disease or vascular disease clearly the vessels are much more um affected by minor stimuli as many of the cases occur in women as they're approaching the the per menopausal area so there there seems to be many many factors associated with it and there are many other theories however these these are some of the more common theories Dr Fox friends of mine with rosacea complain about the rosacea being triggered by certain things what are some known trigger factors for rosacea there are many precipitating factors however the factors vary between Patient to Patient uh the national racea Foundation has an excellent um patient handout on common precipitating factors some of the more common ones include certain foods like spicy foods or a lot of times things with tomato sauce and many patients in certain in certain patients foods with nitrates like salamis certain patients foods with acidity uh stress is a common factor other common precipitant Sy include alcohol change in weather emotional ability that can also sometimes precipitate it for many patients who gets rosacea are you predisposed if you're a certain age or nationality as we stated before rosacea is a very common disease with over 14 million Americans having it although most don't realize they have it it can occur in any ethnicity however it is much more common of those with fair skin it tends to Ur between the ages of 30 to 60 women get it twice as common as men however the disease is worse often times in the M what are some of the signs and symptoms that a person may have rosacea first let's define what it means by sign and symptom a sign is something that a doctor notices a symptom is something that the patient notices so therefore the signs the doctor notices is is a paple which is like a little uh pimple which may be filled with pus uh a a pusle which is rather puls filled with pus uh red red red blood vessels that are coed into the skin diffuse aemma they may develop eye symptoms uh keratitis these are the some of the things that that a doctor whether it be a dermatologist or an opthalmologist May notice now the symptoms are those which the patient feels the patient may feel flushing warmth uh they may feel um burning itching a pulling on the skin they may even find it painful in fact migraines are two to three times more common in patients with rosacea and ocular keratitis can even rarely cause blindness so there are some rare symptoms that can have pretty severe effect effects another common rare effect that people can get is the Rhino the enlarged nose how long does rosacea last and it can can it be prevented altogether rosacea is a long-term disease and it can lasts till persons in their mid-60s although there are even cases rarely where it can even last longer can it be prevented we have no known way to prevent the disease however we as we' discussed previously there are certain precipitating factors and therefore we should try to avoid those precipitating factors for example sunscreen May lessen the effect of the sun uh people that are stressed they should try to be more calm if going into from cold to hot or hot to cold affects the person they should try to make it a more gradual change it's also important Cindy to be gentle with your skin as if you're overly harsh with with with to your skin and may also promote our precipitate in another episode is there a cure for rosacea or at least a treatment to control it dayto day fortunately Cindy there are many excellent new therapies many of them just around 10 years old these include topical antibiotics oral antibiotics topical retinoids oral retinoids like acutane 13 C noic acid emal such as nerel cream and as well as uh azolic acid and and U metronidazol topical metronidazol so there's many new therapies however some of the old therapies such as uh sodium s sulfacetamide and precipitated sulfur and salicylic acid are often helpful in help in treatment of this condition patients sometimes try to treat their own rosacea and end up exacerbating it what do patients do wrong I think the first mistake is that many patients view this as their being that this is part of them and that therefore they don't need to seek treatment or shouldn't seek treatment for it that it may be considered cosmetic every insurance company in the United States considers this to be a medical problem which deserves medical therapy and most medical therapies are very very effective from the topical antibiotics to all the creams that I mentioned previously and therefore we can treat them and be very successful most of the time and only require laser and those patients who are resistant to the more simple therapies so therefore the first and most important point is that they should seek care from an appropriate dermatologist who is familiar with this condition and if necess necessary from a dermatologic laser surgeon who's capable of treating some of the resistant sequel of this disease are conditioned how exactly can lasers help rosacea patients this is a very important point that you're making lasers can help different aspects of the rosacea the different aspects that the lasers can help is the vascular component the redness of the face the broken blood vessels and some of the pap that's the lasers that help that part of the disease however a patient with a large thicken nose there's different lasers that we have to help the Rhino Fus component we're able to layer the nose back to normal as you said earlier Dr Fox rosacea sometimes presents with red papules and patients sometimes confuse this for with acne what's the real difference between rosacea and acne that's a good question there are really two completely different diseases however they do share some common threads such as papules pules however acne tends to have Comon which we do not find in rosacea and there are many other differences which are really beyond the scope of this discussion thank you very much for joining us today Dr Fox thank you so much for asking me and thank you so much for all your hard work on helping the many patients with rosacea",

        "transcript": "hello and welcome to doctor's orders here at the Chris TV show I'm dr. Rob Hicks today we're going to be talking about rosacea this is a long term inflammatory condition of the skin that affects round about one in ten people rosacea causes a host of different symptoms it causes redness and flushing of the skin of the face that may be intermittent or it may be permanent it also causes small blood vessels to be visible beneath the skin and it causes bumps and pimples on the skin of the face some of the other symptoms that it can cause are a discomfort of the skin so the skin may feel itchy it may feel like it's stinging or burning and the skin may appear dry and flaky and sometimes with rosacea the skin gets thickened around the face particularly around the nose and that can leave somebody with the appearance of a bulbous nose now nobody knows precisely what causes rosacea but we do know what sort of triggers can cause flare-ups of this condition exposure to UV radiation in sunlight can cause a flare-up changes in weather temperature caffeine spicy foods alcohol and as in many health conditions stress is a major trigger for a lot of people although we can't cure this condition thankfully there are lots of things that we can do to help people and that really deals with the physical side of the condition the emotional side of the condition and indeed the social side because it's not just the physical symptoms the facial redness the small blood vessels maybe the bulbous nose that causes a problem it's also the emotional effect that the skin condition has on a person's well-being causes them more stress which makes matters worse causes them anxiety depression they may lose their self-esteem because of their condition and socially rosacea has an impact too because people feel embarrassed about the way their skin looks they feel very very self-conscious and in turn this may mean that they actually avoid social situation and become very isolated so some of the things that we can do to help somebody with rosacea the first thing is not to stare at their face there are self-conscious enough about the way that they look so us staring would only make matters worse so so don't do that the other thing is to learn the facts about rosacea all too often you'll hear people say oh that person with the Redmond face on it and a bulbous nose they must be an alcoholic that's not the case far from it many people with rosacea don't drink alcohol because they know that it triggers their symptoms so be sensitive to people with rosacea and indeed all skin conditions so there are a number of treatments around to keep this condition under control one is to keep a symptom diary to try and identify what specific triggers set off your rosacea and then you know what you need to avoid as best you can makeup is useful for covering up the skin so that people can't see the redness and can't see the lumps and bumps then of course there are creams and gels that can be applied to reduce the redness reduce the lumps and bumps the pimples and sometimes the pustules and sometimes oral medications given as well for example antibiotics again to reduce the spots that may come with rosacea and for some people laser therapy is used to actually lessen the appearance of those tiny but visible blood vessels in the face so if you think that you may have rosacea because of your symptoms or you actually have rosacea and it's not been as well controlled as you'd like it to be then do seek the advice of your own doctor and that's doctor's orders I you",

        "transcript": "hey what if I told you that rosacea is not a skin issue but rather just a symptom of a deeper problem within your body so if you wake up every morning dreading the thought of facing yet another day battling your rosacea and the sight of your inflamed skin despite all your efforts to control the flares makes you want to hide from the world and leaves you feeling utterly defeated then stick around because this video is just for you my friend it's time to stop treating rosacea like it's a skin issue and start addressing the underlying root causes of the problem today we're going to talk about how your rosacea symptoms are connected to your gut health and potentially to a situation called histamine intolerance I'm Tammy Anderson functional health expert and when it comes to the pain embarrassment and frustration of dealing with a stubborn skin issue I've been in your shoes for like 20 years and I know the pain and suffering all too well and I've had the privilege of working with numerous clients who came to me in that place of profound despair just wanting to hide themselves from the world much like how you might be feeling right now as well but the good news is just like myself and my clients who have healed their rosacea I want to assure you that there is hope that it is possible to put an end to the suffering from rosacea once and for all but like I said a minute ago you have to stop treating it like a skin issue and start addressing the root causes of the problem one of which is gut issues and very likely an underlying issue called histamine intolerance quick story many years ago when I saw a naturopathic doctor for the first time I was told that my skin troubles were rooted in a leaky gut but at the time this was a totally foreign concept to me and honestly she didn't do a very good job of explaining what having a leaky gut meant and for the life of me I simply couldn't wrap my head around how on Earth my gut could have anything to do with my problem skin now while this doctor really didn't do much for me in terms of offering the right guidance to heal my gut and I didn't really see any results in working with her it did open my eyes and my mind to the concept that my gut was somehow connected to at least my skin health and it wasn't until several years later actually when I started focusing on healing myself from the inside out and addressing my gut health when I was making a truly desperate attempt to get my life back because I was dealing with a life-threatening respiratory issue that's when I noticed that not only did my respiratory problem in the laundry list of other health issues that I had been dealing with all started to disappear at the same time and along with those issues my skin trouble started to disappear as well and and I had been dealing with awful skin for like 20 years at that point and that's when I had my big aha moment and it became clear to me that all of these symptoms which I had just attributed to bad luck or bad genetics were all intricately connected to an underlying problem and it wasn't until later that I actually discovered that histamine intolerance was at the root cause of this laundry list of symptoms that I had been struggling with and I also understood the crucial role of gut healing in reversing histamine intolerance and truly healing myself from the inside out so what I want you to understand is that your gut health is intimately linked to your overall well-being and that includes your skin your skin is the largest organ of your body and skin related symptoms are just your body telling you that something is wrong on the inside so think about this your gut is the one part of your body that is inside your body but is also exposed to the outside world it's like a long tube that stretches from your mouth including your nose all the way through your body through the exit at the other end so the lining of your gut acts as a protective barrier against external threats from the outside world like toxins pathogens inflammatory foods and other things however when this lining becomes compromised a condition called leaky gut occurs and what happens is the Once really tightly connected cells that line your gut loosen up and that allows toxins pathogens undigested food particles and other things to enter your bloodstream where they don't belong and this triggers a red alert from the immune system and that leads to widespread inflammation throughout the body and a host of chronic symptoms and other conditions can result from this so before I go further into how a damaged gut lining can lead to histamine and tolerance parents and your rosacea symptoms I want to invite you to grab access to the free histamine video training that I've created for you if you're ready to dive deeper into understanding and addressing the underlying causes of histamine intolerance and just truly transforming your skin and your life so the link for that is in the description below this video so make sure to go grab that alright so back to the gut when the gut is leaky and damaged another critical function of the gut is compromised and that is the production of an enzyme called diamine oxidase or Dao Dao is primarily produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine and its function is to break down and neutralize histamine preventing it from building up too much in the body and reducing the risk of histamine-related symptoms so when the gut lining becomes compromised it gets damaged and the Dao enzyme production or function becomes insufficient because of that gut lining damage histamine levels start to go up and up and up leading to a condition known as histamine intolerance now histamine plays many roles in the body a major one of which is immune responses and because of this we need the ability to get histamine anywhere in the body in an instant whenever there's a need for it has an immune response that's why we have histamine receptors on virtually every cell of the body and because of that histamine intolerance can manifest as a wide range of symptoms throughout the body and that includes your skin and yes that also includes rosacea so rosacea may be your most visible sign that you might be dealing with a histamine intolerance but there are other Telltale indicators that histamine intolerance could be an underlying issue for you so if you experience other unexplained symptoms in other parts of your body like headaches or migraines fatigue allergies or respiratory problems itching anxiety or panic attacks a rapid heartbeat fainting spells sleep issues urinary urgency food sensitivity digestive issues like bloating or diarrhea then these are some big clues that an underlying histamine intolerance is probably going on because there's usually a cluster of symptoms it's not just one thing and everybody by the way has kind of a different cluster of symptoms so no two people may have the exact same symptom profile when they have a histamine intolerance so like I said too much histamine built up in the body can create Havoc anywhere in the body so if you want to truly be free from the pain inflammation and embarrassment of rosacea once and for all and have clear skin and more confidence you need to shift your focus from the surface problem to the root causes and that starts with improving your gut health that is absolutely critical so if you're ready to start fixing your gut and want a strategic and effective no guessing no Rabbit Hole diving approach so that you can start feeling lighter and more confident in your skin I've created a gut repair tool kit for you and you can get started on that Journey right away you'll find a link to find more information and get started today in the description below this video so when it comes to your skin and your overall health it's critical to understand that it's never just one thing there's almost always a combination of factors involved that create What I Call The Perfect Storm and that's why it's so important to take a truly holistic approach when addressing the underlying issues and not just treat it as a skin issue so my self-guided program the histamine solution Academy guides you to implement a truly holistic approach to address the problem from the inside out it's structured around four important pillars that work together to allow you to get deep healing from within by addressing all the contributing factors so the pillars include nutritional support lifestyle and environment modifications

histamine intolerance and your gut you're not only going to start that journey to clear radiant skin that you can feel more confident in but you'll also be improving your overall health and your your

        "transcript": "probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea the first one is actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big
