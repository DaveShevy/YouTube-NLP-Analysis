        "transcript": "if you have facial redness, flushing, skin\u00a0\nirritation, and think you may have rosacea - then\u00a0\u00a0 this is the video you've been waiting for.\u00a0\nI'm going to tell you what rosacea is,\u00a0\u00a0 how it's diagnosed, and most importantly, focus on\u00a0\nhow to treat it using a combination of lifestyle,\u00a0\u00a0 over-the-counter, prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\nand also procedures. My name is Dr Syed and I'm a\u00a0\u00a0 board-certified dermatologist living and working\u00a0\nin New York. My channel focuses on scientific\u00a0\u00a0 skincare content without the marketing\u00a0\nBS, so if you're into that kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0 if it really gets you going, hey, there's no\u00a0\njudgment here, just hit that subscribe button.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's get into it. Rosacea is a chronic skin\u00a0\ncondition where your skin is hypersensitive,\u00a0\u00a0 gets irritated easily, and goes red quickly\u00a0\nbecause there's more superficial blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 near the surface. It's most often triggered by\u00a0\nsun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 or feeling embarrassed. So this emoji here\u00a0\nlikely has rosacea, whereas this emoji here,\u00a0\u00a0 clearly has herpes: stay away from him. Now\u00a0\nthe redness in rosacea mainly happens on the\u00a0\u00a0 cheeks and on the nose. It usually starts at\u00a0\naround 30 years old and gets worse with age,\u00a0\u00a0 but it can happen much earlier. Both men and\u00a0\nwomen, and people of all races, can get rosacea:\u00a0\u00a0 even though it is under-diagnosed in men because\u00a0\nthey don't take their skin health seriously,\u00a0\u00a0 and in people with darker skin tones because it's\u00a0\nnot as noticeable when they go red. There are four\u00a0\u00a0 different subtypes of rosacea, but they do overlap\u00a0\nso these aren't strict divides. The first of these\u00a0\u00a0 is erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, which as\u00a0\nthe name suggests is where you have redness (the\u00a0\u00a0 erythemato) and telangectasia (which are\u00a0\nthe prominent superficial blood vessels).\u00a0\u00a0 This is the most common type of presentation\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next, we have papulopustular,\u00a0\u00a0 which is much more of an acne rosacea overlap\u00a0\nbecause you notice papules and pustules on the\u00a0\u00a0 face with a background of redness. Rhinophymatous\u00a0\nrosacea is the third type and this is when you\u00a0\u00a0 have chronic inflammation on the nose, and over\u00a0\ntime this makes it get thick and fibrotic. And\u00a0\u00a0 we can probably all remember seeing someone in our\u00a0\nlives with a nose that look like this, usually an\u00a0\u00a0 older guy, and you probably assumed that he got\u00a0\nthat in a bar fight. But it was actually rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and he is innocent. And finally, we have ocular\u00a0\nrosacea which is rosacea affecting the eyes. This\u00a0\u00a0 presents with red eyes, irritation and a gritty\u00a0\nsensation in the eyes. So if you go red easily\u00a0\u00a0 and you always feel like you have something\u00a0\nin your eye, make sure that rosacea is on\u00a0\u00a0 your radar. Rosacea is thought to be caused by a\u00a0\ncombination of genetics, skin and gut microbiome,\u00a0\u00a0 and UV exposure. And there's a lot more to say\u00a0\nthere which is pretty fascinating, but because\u00a0\u00a0 this video is focusing on treatments, I'm going to\u00a0\nleave it at that. So let's talk about treatments,\u00a0\u00a0 and for those of you familiar with my channel,\u00a0\nwhich is obviously all of you who are subscribed.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, what's that? Only 5% of people watching this\u00a0\nare subscribed? You're f*#c%ng with me... 5%?!\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, well I love those 5% of you and to the other\u00a0\n95%, I'm so disappointed I don't even know what to\u00a0\u00a0 say. So those of you familiar with my channel know\u00a0\nthat I like to approach treatments with lifestyle\u00a0\u00a0 interventions first, then over the counter\u00a0\noptions, then prescription creams and tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 and finally procedures. So let's start with\u00a0\nlifestyle. We already hinted earlier that rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 gets worse with some well-known triggers such\u00a0\nas sun exposure, spicy food, cold temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 and embarrassment. So the lifestyle interventions\u00a0\ninclude avoiding those triggers. So 1) wear\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreen. And those of you with rosacea need to\u00a0\nbe EXTRA careful with sunscreen compared to the\u00a0\u00a0 general public. I recommend that you use a minimum\u00a0\nSPF 50 and that you should use physical sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0 and not chemical sunscreens. What I mean by\u00a0\nthat is you should look for products which have\u00a0\u00a0 zinc and titanium in them, not ones that contain\u00a0\noxybenzone or avobenzone. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 because people with rosacea have sensitive skin\u00a0\nand chemical sunscreens can be more irritating.\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be reapplying your sunscreen in\u00a0\nthe afternoon and not just in the morning. Now I'm\u00a0\u00a0 not one of those militant dermatologists who tells\u00a0\neveryone to reapply sunscreen every two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally I tell people, hey, do it in the morning\u00a0\nand every little helps. But if you have rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely, take some in your bag with you to work\u00a0\nand reapply in the afternoon. So the next step in\u00a0\u00a0 trigger avoidance is to not eat spicy food. Now\u00a0\nif you're brown like I am the idea of avoiding\u00a0\u00a0 spicy food probably sounds like a fate worse than\u00a0\ndeath itself. And so I would rather shine bright\u00a0\u00a0 red and eat my biryani. But if you don't like\u00a0\nspicy food anyway then this should be easy. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding cold weather, and what you can do is\u00a0\nwear a scarf or some kind of ski mask to make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you don't turn up at work bright red during\u00a0\nthe winter months. And finally, avoiding social\u00a0\u00a0 embarrassment, which I think is a great rule\u00a0\nof life for basically everyone. And here are\u00a0\u00a0 some essential tips for avoiding embarrassment.\u00a0\n1) don't have food in your teeth. 2) don't eat\u00a0\u00a0 foods that give you gas. And 3) if you're going\u00a0\nto click on TikTok make sure your volume is low,\u00a0\u00a0 because that autoplay is always going to embarrass\u00a0\nyou in a quiet room. Okay, so that's advice for\u00a0\u00a0 the general triggers, but my next piece of\u00a0\nlifestyle advice is to help identify your own\u00a0\u00a0 individual triggers. People with rosacea may have\u00a0\nsome unique triggers for them such as cosmetics,\u00a0\u00a0 certain types of foods, or exercise. If you make\u00a0\na habit of keeping a little diary in your phone\u00a0\u00a0 every time you feel yourself flushing, you\u00a0\nmight be able to identify some triggers that\u00a0\u00a0 you otherwise would have missed. And the final\u00a0\npiece of lifestyle advice which I'm obviously\u00a0\u00a0 a huge expert on is makeup. There are actually\u00a0\nsome types of makeup that have a green tint and\u00a0\u00a0 what they do is they cancel out the redness\u00a0\nfrom rosacea to give you more of a baseline\u00a0\u00a0 look. I know that Clinique has a Redness Solutions\u00a0\nline which seems to be pretty popular, although\u00a0\u00a0 I have no association with them. So next up for\u00a0\nrosacea treatments is over-the-counter options,\u00a0\u00a0 and before I talk about which over-the-counter\u00a0\nproducts you should use, it's more important\u00a0\u00a0 even for me to clarify which ones you SHOULDN'T\u00a0\nuse if you have rosacea. As I said before, people\u00a0\u00a0 with rosacea have sensitive skin, and therefore\u00a0\nthey need to avoid any ingredients that have an\u00a0\u00a0 irritating potential. These include things like\u00a0\nphysical exfoliants, those microbead scrubs, or\u00a0\u00a0 even chemical exfoliants with things like glycolic\u00a0\nacids, salicylic acid, or lactic acid. Also\u00a0\u00a0 benzoyl peroxide and certain types of vitamin C\u00a0\ncan be extremely irritating, and finally, chemical\u00a0\u00a0 sunscreens and retinoid products. Now that\u00a0\nmay come as a shock to you because I basically\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned every popular skincare ingredient on the\u00a0\nwhole of social media. But keep in mind that even\u00a0\u00a0 if those ingredients can have amazing effects for\u00a0\nother people, if you have rosacea and sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 skin, they're likely going to do more harm\u00a0\nthan good for you. So even when it comes to my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite type of ingredients which are retinoids,\u00a0\nI would advise you not to use one unless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Okay,\u00a0\nso what over-the-counter products should you use?\u00a0\u00a0 1) is moisturizers, and that's because maintaining\u00a0\na solid skin barrier which is nice and hydrated is\u00a0\u00a0 going to have an anti-inflammatory effect on your\u00a0\nskin. If you're able to use a moisturizer which is\u00a0\u00a0 specifically hypoallergenic from a brand like\u00a0\nVanicream, that is even better for you. Next,\u00a0\u00a0 gentle hydrating cleansers, and if you have\u00a0\nrosacea you should only really be using a\u00a0\u00a0 hydrating cleanser and not a foaming one or\u00a0\na medicated one. A few examples of hydrating\u00a0\u00a0 cleansers should be linked below my video, but\u00a0\nbasically look for anything that doesn't foam.\u00a0\u00a0 As I mentioned earlier, physical sunscreens with\u00a0\nzinc and titanium are what you want to go for. Now\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to active ingredients, azelaic\u00a0\nacid really is your best friend if you have\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea because it's anti-inflammatory and reduces\u00a0\nredness. The higher concentrations of azelaic acid\u00a0\u00a0 are prescription only, but I've linked some\u00a0\nover-the-counter options below the video. And\u00a0\u00a0 finally, sulfur-based products. Now this can be\u00a0\na cream, a cleanser, or even a mask. Sulfur is\u00a0\u00a0 known to be a great anti-inflammatory option for\u00a0\nrosacea, but there are surprisingly few sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 containing options in the US at least. If you do\u00a0\nhappen to find some good over-the-counter sulfur\u00a0\u00a0 options, comment below so we can all benefit.\u00a0\nBut one thing I do want to warn you all about\u00a0\u00a0 is that sulfur containing products smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. Now, let's move on to prescription\u00a0\u00a0 creams and I'm going to kick things off with\u00a0\nmetronidazole. This is one of the first line\u00a0\u00a0 options for rosacea but I'll be honest, I think\u00a0\nit's pretty trash. I will personally only ever\u00a0\u00a0 prescribe metronidazole if somebody's insurance\u00a0\nplan insists that they try and fail it first,\u00a0\u00a0 but from my experience, it doesn't tend to do a\u00a0\nlot. Next, azelaic acid, and that is at 15-20%\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations which are prescription only here in\u00a0\nthe US. The most popular formulation is something\u00a0\u00a0 called Finacea which is an azelaic acid foam.\u00a0\nOkay so as I mentioned azelaic acid has a proven\u00a0\u00a0 benefit when it comes to anti-inflammation,\u00a0\nanti-redness, anti-pigmentation, it's suitable\u00a0\u00a0 for sensitive skin, and you can even use it if\u00a0\nyou're pregnant, so this really is a superstar,\u00a0\u00a0 powerhouse ingredient in the world of\u00a0\nskincare. Next, we ivermectin cream,\u00a0\u00a0 and you may remember that word \"ivermectin\" from\u00a0\nwhen Joe Rogan took it and all of the news talked\u00a0\u00a0 about it as a 'horse dewormer'. But why would an\u00a0\nanti-parasitic cream help for rosacea? Well, it's\u00a0\u00a0 thought that the Demodex mite which horrifyingly\u00a0\nlives on all of our skin, may exist in higher\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations in those people people who have\u00a0\nrosacea. So ivermectin cream, which is really\u00a0\u00a0 effective at killing mites, therefore reduces the\u00a0\namount of Demodex and reduces the inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in rosacea sufferers. From my experience,\u00a0\nivermectin cream is probably the best of all\u00a0\u00a0 prescription creams when it comes to results\u00a0\nfor rosacea. Next up we have Oxymetazoline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is prescribed as Rhofade in the U.S. The\u00a0\nway this works is it stimulates the constriction\u00a0\u00a0 of those superficial blood vessels in our skin,\u00a0\nand therefore reduces redness in those people who\u00a0\u00a0 have rosacea. It's only a short-term reversible\u00a0\neffect and so this isn't a cure for rosacea,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's great if you're going to some kind of\u00a0\nevent and you want to reduce the redness on your\u00a0\u00a0 face. Now although there's no over-the-counter\u00a0\nrosacea cream that has oxymetazoline in it,\u00a0\u00a0 it happens to be the main active ingredient in a\u00a0\nnasal decongestant spray known as Afrin. So if you\u00a0\u00a0 were to take Afrin nasal spray and put two pumps\u00a0\ninto your favorite moisturizer and apply it to\u00a0\u00a0 your face, you've basically got a bootleg Rhofade.\u00a0\nSo try it out and see what you think, if you want,\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't medical advice, don't sue me. Next,\u00a0\nwe're onto tablet medications and stay with me we\u00a0\u00a0 are almost there. These are usually reserved for\u00a0\npeople who have very severe rosacea resistant to\u00a0\u00a0 all those other treatments, or if the rosacea is\u00a0\naffecting the nose in that Rhinophymatous form I\u00a0\u00a0 was telling you about, then we jump straight\u00a0\nto tablet medications. Oral doxycycline,\u00a0\u00a0 which is an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory\u00a0\ntablet, is one of my favorite treatments for\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea. At high doses it's only safe to use\u00a0\noral doxycycline for around two to three months,\u00a0\u00a0 but there is a low dose extended release version\u00a0\nknown as 'Oracea' which is actually safe to use\u00a0\u00a0 for much longer. Other antibiotic tablets like\u00a0\nerythromycin or metronidazole are also sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 used, but in my opinion doxycycline is the best.\u00a0\nAnd finally low-dose oral isotretinoin, also\u00a0\u00a0 known as Accutane, can be a great treatment for\u00a0\ntimes when nothing else is working. And finally,\u00a0\u00a0 let's wrap up with procedures. And primarily these\u00a0\nare just vascular lasers. The most commonly used\u00a0\u00a0 ones are IPL and V-beam laser, and what these do\u00a0\nis they literally just explode the superficial\u00a0\u00a0 blood vessels in your skin, and after a little bit\u00a0\nof bruising for a few days, those blood vessels\u00a0\u00a0 just disappear. The results from these vascular\u00a0\nlaser treatments are really amazing, and most\u00a0\u00a0 people only ever need one or two treatments for\u00a0\ntheir whole life. You get a long-term sustained\u00a0\u00a0 benefit and so I think these vascular lasers are\u00a0\nan amazing option for people who have fair skin,\u00a0\u00a0 not so much in people with darker skin tones,\u00a0\nbecause then it can lead to burns. The downside\u00a0\u00a0 of these vascular lasers is that you'll have\u00a0\na little bit of downtime for a few days,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly it's that insurances\u00a0\ndon't cover them. In most places in New York,\u00a0\u00a0 the prices vary from around $300-$500 per\u00a0\ntreatment ,and so even if you times that by 2,\u00a0\u00a0 at $600-$1000 I think that's pretty good value\u00a0\nfor money for something that really is a long-term\u00a0\u00a0 fix. This is also a good time to clarify that\u00a0\nI'm not biased, I'm not offering these laser\u00a0\u00a0 treatments with me, I have no deal with any\u00a0\nlaser company: this is just the scientific\u00a0\u00a0 truth. So that was an absolute marathon, and if\u00a0\nyou managed to make it all the way to the end,\u00a0\u00a0 drop a comment below with a medal or a trophy\u00a0\nbecause you deserve some recognition for your\u00a0\u00a0 commitment. And if you like scientific skincare\u00a0\ncontent like this, you may enjoy the video I did\u00a0\u00a0 on acne treatments. Otherwise, thank you so much\u00a0\nfor watching and I will catch you in the next one.",

        "transcript": "well hey guys let's talk about facial redness with rosacea in this video I'm going to give you tips tricks and I'm going to talk about skin care products skincare practices that can help you out in your journey to clearing and preventing worsening of persistent facial redness with rosacea if you have rosacea chances are you experience sensitivity burning stinging with things that come in contact with the skin and episodes of flushing and blushing and over time that flushing and blushing can lead to persistent facial redness along with dilated blood vessels now people with rosacea also develop little pimple-like bumps called papules sometimes these can be filled with pus those are called pules most of the treatments that we prescribe to treat rosacea Target the papules the pules and some of the symptoms however if persistent facial redness is going on not many topical medications or oral medications adequately address that and spoiler alert that tends to be the thing that impacts quality of life and rosacea patients the most it's the persistent facial redness the episodes of flushing and blushing yes it's a pain to have burning stinging sensitivity yes the bumps are annoying but the treatments can help those go away it's that persistent facial redness so what exactly can you do well you can't lay off the lifestyle factors that play into managing rosacea there's not a cure for rosacea it requires a proactive and ongoing approach to manage symptoms and to prevent it from recurring and from flaring so that includes avoiding triggers now I have videos all about common rosacea triggers things like alcoholic beverages Sun heat certain medications certain foods are big offenders for many people with rosacea such as cinnamon chocolate not to say everyone has problems with those foods but they are common culprits if you want to know more about the foods that trigger rosacea I'm going to link my video all about this topic in the description box while skincare products can only offer so much I would say when it comes to rosacea your skincare routine can quite literally make or break you meaning if you use too many products if you're too harsh with your routine it can really aggravate your skin but if you neglect your skin care some of the underlying root cause issues behind rosacea are going to suffer first and foremost you want to stay consistent with cleansing I suggest choosing a gentle cleanser to remove dirt oil sebum cosmetic residue which if left behind can contribute to irritation it may actually also be a more favorable millu for those little Demodex mites that we've talked about as a player in rosacea but you've got to be careful with washing your face if you wash your face with a harsh cleanser you use an aggressive scrub or you wash your face too frequently well that can disrupt your already impaired skin barrier and leave lead to more transepidermal water loss burning stinging and guess what flares of the facial redness so your cleansing habits have to be dialed in I suggest washing your face once a day ideally at night time to remove cosmetic residue dirt debris from throughout the day there are so many Fantastic mild gentle cleansers out there I often suggest the vanic cream gentle cleanser the other thing that you want to be proactive about is consistently moisturizing your skin with a lightweight hydrating moisturizer heavy moisturizers can sometimes get in the way of evaporation of sweat make you feel overheated and precipitate a flush but moisturizing is important because again with rosacea there is an impaired skin barrier allowing for easier penetration of things that trigger flushing and blushing as well as dryness from transepidermal water loss through that impaired barrier moisturizers can Aid in replenishing moisture content getting barrier recovery back on track and they also help reduce water loss from the skin you might want to choose a moisturizer with niacinamide or licorice shud these ingredients help calm down redness it can be very beneficial for rosacea because of that along with their barrier supporting properties and their anti-inflammatory effects however if you don't get along with those ingredients and you just want a Bare Bones moisturizer I suggest vanic creams lightweight lotion very easy to tolerate on the face and can also be used on the body wouldn't be a video without me without emphasis on sun protection but this is really really important ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can trigger rosace it's a common trigger including ultraviolet radiation that comes through window glass so wearing a sunscreen regularly can really help you out along with sun protective behaviors like wearing a hat seeking shade there are two main types of sunscreens chemical sunscreens and mineral sunscreens otherwise known as organic and inorganic sunscreens un fortunately a lot of the organic sunscreens while they are more lightweight and hydrating while they don't leave a white cast they can burn and sting and aggravate rosacea for some people other option is to choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide these tend to not burn not sting Unfortunately they can be quite thick and pasty and a lot of people don't like them so there is actually a middle ground where you can go with a hybrid sunscreen it has zinc but it also has some chemical filters in it but overall tends to be less likely to burn and sting and also less likely to be thick pasty chalky and less likely to leave a white cast when it comes to sunscreen the whole messaging around it is protecting you from ultraviolet radiation did you know though that ultraviolet radiation from the Sun wallet is what leads to skin cancer and premature skin aging it's actually only a small proportion of the total amount of energy that comes from the Sun and hits our skin a big chunk is visible light if you have a medium to deep skin tone um high energy blue light wavelengths from sunlight can actually contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation so that's something to factor in so what I suggest is choosing a tinted sunscreen The Tint comes from Iron oxides and that can actually offer some protection against those wavelengths of visible light that come from the Sun and contribute to redness and hyperpigmentation Cetaphil has a anti- redness relief SPF 40 moisturizer it's a mineral tinted sunscreen that is a great option for rosacea um I think they Honestly made it with rosacea in mind not only is it a mineral sunscreen which tends to be well tolerated but it's tinted so you get that visible light protection aspect and it also has caffeine and licorice shot both of those can help calm down redness now admittedly it is kind of thick chalky and it also is a tint that is not going to be acceptable for all skin tones so the other one that I suggest Is Neutrogena pure screen it is a tinted mineral sunscreen water resistant that would be another great option and it comes in light medium medium deep and deep Shades um but if you find those to be too chalky not quite the right tint I also suggest a hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology Dr RM tlg y this is a great everyday facial moisturizer and it has n cinnamide in it which is good for the redness of rosacea and also helps to address the moisture barrier and calm down inflammation now is there anything that can be applied to the skin that will help clear up the facial redness well there are actually two FDA approved topical medications for the redness aspect of rosace these medications are alpha Agonist and the way they work is they bind receptors on blood vessels to cause them to shrink so that makes the redness improve while they are part of the same class of Med medications the way they behave is a little bit different so let's talk about them first you have one called bronine sold under the brand name as meso but know the name bronine because it could be prescribed to you in some other branded way brimonidine acts very quickly when you appli to the Skin Within about 30 minutes however one thing that happens to some people they get kind of like an intense rebound worsening of the redness bronine wears off after 10 to 12 hours and one of the biggest complaints I hear from people who use bronine for their redness is that it's a little bit too unnatural looking and that it clamps down more I guess intensely and they get kind of a whitening effect where their skin looks pale blanched then you have oxymetazoline the brand name of this drug is rade oxymetazoline is a lot more gradual in its onset and you get a peak reduction in redness after about 3 hours of it having been on your skin that's really when you see you know kind of Maximum effects so for example you might want to put it on in the morning as part of your morning skincare routine and then by the time you get to the office maybe you have meetings and things it's already taken effect and you have a reduction in redness in contrast to bronine oxymetazoline doesn't show that rebound worsening redness and it is not um it's it's not it doesn't cause over whitening effect either unfortunately these medications often are not covered by um insurance they can be but not always and they can be expensive out of pocket so sort of a little hack that um can sometimes be an option is oxy metazine is actually what is in over-the-counter afron nasal spray so that's sort of like a less expensive dupe if you will of the prescription um rade Now While most of the other prescription topicals primarily Target the bumps that's not to say that by targeting the bumps they're not going to have any impact on facial redness so if you look really carefully at the bumps of rosacea they're often surrounded by redness and so um things like aoic acid or doxy cycl topical icton all of these things help to primarily address the inflammation the bumps help clear up the bumps but they don't help with that background redness so just keep that in mind they will help however with the redness around the bumps it's certainly not a one andone thing when it comes to rosacea and truthfully using multiple treatments often times can get the best results and there is evidence that treating the facial redness the background redness early in conjunction with the other treatments that Target the bumps can lead to Optimal um outcomes over the counter in terms of stuff that you can buy you have topical sulfur you have prosacea which is kind of a lightweight gel and you also have the daylight Cru sulfur mask both are great options they calm down the inflammation and they help Target those little bumps which Again by targeting little bumps you kind of address the inflammation around them that leads to the perilesional redness AIC acid is a topical medication that can be prescribed for rosacea again to address the little bmps but you also can buy cosmetic products with um AIC acid for example the Polish Choice AIC acid booster it's a great option in addition to the background redness a lot of patients with rosacea will go on to develop prominent Tean jaasia is dilated blood vessels often around the nose what can get rid of that unfortunately topicals don't really touch that at all and once those develop it's going to be light based devices to clear those up to Target them to seal them up with light based energy so that they involute and go away so for example intense pulse light IPL in other words is an option also pulse Dye Laser targets those dilated blood vessels it can also help with the background redness and then a laser called KTP um fun little tip though if you are going for these talk to your doctor about this but um a way to get maximum benefit out of these treatments is don't just go Um when your skin is like super clear in a good day try and actually get yourself to flush a bit right before the treatment so sometimes we would have a patient go out and run laps around the parking lot to get a flush going and that really helps the laser be more efficient at targeting the areas where you develop redness the other thing that can be quite helpful especially in addition to some of these other things that we've talked about is you might be surprised to hear Botox actually can help with facial redness and it's thought to work by reducing inflamm by inhibiting release of histamine from massels massel degranulation which sets off an inflammatory Cascade so if you're someone who has rosacea and you say get BOTOX for recalls maybe you've noticed that things have started to improve since getting Botox it could be that the other topical for rosacea is actually tranexamic acid now tranexamic acid we think about more so for melasma when we treat patients with a pill of tranexamic acid it really can help their melasma out the hyperpigmentation applying it to the skin may or may not help the hyperpigmentation but really it does seem to shine as a topical remedy for redness with rosacea and it may be because of its effects on the blood vessels but it may also be a combination of its anti-inflammatory properties along with the fact that it can really help an impaired Skin Barrier so in clinic we actually can make up our own topical tranexamic acid using uh the the injectable type just you know dilute it and give it to the patient they can actually apply it directly to their skin with like a soaked pad alternatively there are skinc care products with tranexamic acid and a really great affordable tranexamic acid Serum is um from the brand minimalist um it's a great op option free of fragrance and it also has um salicylic acid which may help smooth the skin surface as well as cut down on the fodder if you will for those Demodex mites skin care it's only able to offer so much no skincare product is going to completely Melt Away redness it requires staying consistent with a routine as well as incorporating all the other lifestyle factors in and staying consistent with the treatments that have been prescribed to you it's really important to stay consistent with those prescribed treatments because they help control things you see think of rosacea almost like sitting down in a restaurant for a fancy meal right there are multiple courses to the meal same thing with rosacea instead of courses you have different aspects of rosacea you have the bumps you have the swelling you have the sensitivity you have the skin thickening that can happen in some cases but can't just pick and choose which aspects you want to treat you really need to treat all of it and you need to take a holistic approach and there's no single treatment that is going to get rid of everything just like there is no single utensil that you would be given to eat all of the courses can you imagine if you sat down at an expensive dinner and all they gave you was a butter knife when it comes to managing your rosacea you're going to need multiple utensils and you're going to need to stay consistent to control all aspects of the rosacea and ultimately that will change the course of your rosacea it will skoot away from those recurrent flares of flushing blushing that ultimately set the stage for well now persistent facial redness all right you guys those are my tips tricks skincare

        "transcript": " What have you come\nalong with today, Emma?  I'm come to you today\nbecause I've got rosacea. It started with just\nspots and bit of redness, and it's gradually\ngot a bit worse. The redness is more persistent.  Oh, dear. And do you get this\nanywhere else in the body?  It does go down\nonto my chest area, but that's about\nas far as it goes.  And it feels painful? - Yeah.\n- OK. What kind of treatments\nhave you had for it?  I've had antibiotics. And they'll only give me\nabout eight weeks worth.  OK, and that gets rid\nof the spots and things. Then you come off it, and then\nthe redness still persists. And then eventually\nthe spots come back-- is that the kind\nof pattern of it?  Yeah, that's about\nthe right pattern, yeah.  What kind of things\nmake this worse?  Heat and spicy foods\nmake it flame up. It burns. I can almost feel\nthe vessels popping. It feels like kind\nof explode within.  OK. And what kind of effect has this\nthen had on you over the years?  The effect it had on me--\nit's affecting my confidence, because all I can\nsee is the redness, and that's all people see. And then I get\nembarrassed about it. I've had people come\nup in the street and say, well, what's the\nmatter with your face? You've got beetroot face. And they kind of go\nooh, it's a bit like-- It's not ooh. I can't help it.  And then that's\nannoying, isn't it? Because the anxieties\nmake it worse, so then it flairs, and then--  A nasty cycle.  Well, we're going to see what\nwe can do about it, definitely. I'm just going to have a\nclose-up look at the skin if that's OK. You've got these individual\nlittle blood vessels that I can see, and then as\nwe move down under the cheek itself, the vessels start\nto get a little bit bigger. And then it can just\nfeel that little bumps that you've got just under\nthe surface of the skin. Rosacea is a chronic,\ninflammatory condition of the skin that presents\nnormally with some redness, and that redness\ncan be flat redness or it can be individual\nlittle vessels. In some people, it presents\nwith lumps and bumps, but in Emma's case, she\nis particularly red. Sorry if I'm hurting\nyou in any way.  It's quite nice and cool.  Is it? I do have very\ncold hands normally I have to apologize for them,\nbut you might be liking it. [LAUGHING] One of the things\nthat causes rosacea is when people's skin\nbarrier isn't perhaps quite as good as what it can be. So the things that\nare on the outside might irritate it a bit more. And other things like exposure\nto the sun can also drive it. It's really quite striking\nhow much it spares the perioral area isn't it?  Yeah, I get like panda eyes. Is going down.  So, you want to sit up for me? So, this is really quite\nstriking how flush this is. In a grand scale of 1 to 10--\nit's right up there at a 9. So we need to find\nyou sun protection, cream that you're going to\nwear at least twice a day. And because of these\nbumps under the skin, and these pustules that\nyou're seeing in this area, I do still think\nthat an antibiotic is going to be good-- but in an anti-inflammatory dose\nfor about the next three months to try and get rid of\nthose bumps that are there.",

        "transcript": "[Music] foreign [Music] once again we're visiting our friends at Trillium Creek Dermatology and if you've ever had red cheeks you might be wondering is it rosacea what is this so we're coming to get those answers I'm here with Emily Barker let's talk about rosacea today first of all what is it because I always think of it as the red cheeks is that right that is one of the most common symptoms so rosacea is a chronic skin disorder it's not curable but we do have some things that can help control and eliminate the symptoms the most common being red and flushed cheeks and face some patients also get acne like bumps across the mid face where the redness is the most prominent and then later stage we also see some thickening of the skin of the nose what triggers it there's a lot of triggers so it's caused by an increased dilation of blood facial vessels so those patients have really sensitive blood vessels of the face that's triggered by things like sun exposure hot and cold weather steamy showers and baths alcohol spicy foods and stress those are the most common triggers so it seems like me maybe you could prevent some of that what are some of the treatments yeah so avoiding some of those ones that we just talked about is a big part of our treatment because again we can't cure it but we do have some medications in our tool kit that we can use to help control the symptoms usually it looks like a combination of oral and topical medications like an antibiotic and then when appropriate we do have laser treatment that we can use to help reduce the appearance of the redness now how long do flare-ups usually last they can last it varies from Patient to Patient but sometimes we see patients having symptoms and flares for up to weeks at a time sometimes it's a little bit more quiet depending on what they've come in contact with from a trigger standpoint so when should they come in and talk to you if it's over a couple days I would say if the symptoms are bothersome to them because it's our face we want to be able to you know present Something That We're comfortable with if it's bothersome to them and they're really flushing and blushing and retaining that redness or if they're having those bumps come in and see us so we can talk about treatment well thank you so much for more information or to book your appointment it's tcohio.com foreign [Music]",

        "transcript": "now when it comes to skin there is no more tricky condition than rosacea and i should know so today's video is to highlight five of the biggest mistakes that i've seen when it comes to handling your skin with this problem now spoiler alert there is a theme with these mistakes most of them relate to unpredictability if there's one thing rosacea does not like it's a surprise it will immediately tend to put your skin on red alert no pun intended so make sure you stay right to the end to hear all five so you can be forewarned and forearmed error number one involves exposing yourself to too much heat intentionally now the way the blood vessels in our skin work is that they open up they vasodilate in order to cool us down and typically the skin or redness as a consequence in rosacea those blood vessels are overly sensitive and prone to vasodilating at the drop of a hat so we don't want to provoke that exuberant vasodilation process unnecessarily so by exposing ourselves to extreme heat that's what we're doing we're encouraging the skin to redden and for those with rosacea that process will happen for longer and might potentially increase the blood vessels tendency to do that of their own accord not what we want so my advice is to skip the saunas showers should be tepid not super hot not super long um and stick steamy all together now the next mishap that can perform a rosacea prone skin type is using physical exfoliation i have talked about this before but it's so important it's worth me emphasizing again now think about it most individuals with rosacea have an impaired skin barrier that means the skin tends to lose water more readily and is prone to dehydration the last thing anybody with rosacea needs is whittling away at the stratum corneum with anything physical so that means skipping flannels physical scrubs any aggressive toweling just don't do it please please please stick to cleansing with nothing rougher than your fingertips i promise you your skin will thank you now the next one is about recognizing that rosacea is not a beauty problem it's a medical condition and i guess that that's not uncommon people think that's why they go the rudi facialist for example um they think it's a beauty problem they're prone to redness you know those redness skin skin care um but it is a medical problem and you know can affect more than just the skin can affect the eyes and so forth so i think it's knowing when to ask for help now that might mean going along and talking to your local gp it might mean getting expert care and seeing a dermatologist either way know when you've reached your limits and if your skin is playing on your mind and it's stopping you from doing things and it's creating anxiety or affecting your mood then it's a good thing to go and get some proper help and get a structured plan sometimes even just one visit can make all the difference in the world so no need to suffer alone now mistake number four involves the idea that facials might be the solution to rosacea they are not in fact i would strongly suggest avoiding facials in any of the chronic inflammatory skin disorders rosacea included um too much on predictability potentially too many products usually and a greater likelihood than not of an aggravating effect on the skin and a rosacea flare rosacea really is best managed with your own tool kit that you have complete control over and that there are no rogue elements that might potentially flare up your skin remember no one knows your skin better than you do and on a similar theme it's really important not to get caught out and have to use somebody else's skin care borrowing products or taking recommendations even from friends with rosacea is potentially fraught you really do need to be rigorous and i think you know most of the people i see for the first time in the clinic already know this about their skin care routine they must be disciplined they must not fall prey to twinkly shiny newness the less complicated the products you're using on your skin the better and that then creates a safe space for you to use the right active ingredients that can potentially control your skin and also help you tackle the signs of premature aging which for many rosacea sufferers is also a primary concern because 30 to 50 pretty much a sweet spot for that kind of effort and typically in fair-skinned light-eyed individuals more at risk of uva damage so potentially more work to be done on that front anyway so stick to your own products be rigorous be really strategic about anything new that you integrate into your routine and you know follow your own gut instincts about which products are best for you and try not to be seduced by shiny new things so i think the most important thing with rosacea management when we think about the mistakes i've talked about is being really boring about your skin care it's being consistent it's being diligent it's knowing exactly what products are safe for you um and maybe keeping multiples of them i mean event recovery cream got discontinued recently and changed to a different formula that's kind of being marketed as being the same product when it really isn't and i know that for a lot of patients that's called abstract chaos because there really wasn't a product like it on the market um to replace it the tolerance extreme range is quite good but it's not quite the same in terms of texture and skin feel um whether you're using the emulsion or the cream so you know i'm not saying that you should stock up on the assumption that every product that you know and like is going to be discontinued but you know it's the kind of thing where if you know what's good for your skin having a couple on standby isn't such a bad idea so consistency something i talk about a lot in skincare anyway i know at least i'm consistent with my themes and in the case of rosacea it really will serve you to adopt that approach um it's certainly how i kind of counsel patients and it's almost part of the reason to keep people on follow-up because i find that the longer between appointments oftentimes the more likely they are to have incorporated something that may not necessarily be the best of their skin in the interim so some things for you to bear in mind it's not the complete list of things that can make things worse but it's an important selection of them obviously know your triggers guys i'm just assuming that by the time you've watched this video you are conscious of triggers we've talked about them a lot already in this series and it's important to know what makes your rosacea worse environmentally in terms of diet in terms of skin care um but some other ideas for you to think about now if there's anything in particular about rosacea that i haven't covered in a series of videos so far give me a shout and let me know um i do want to kind of create this library of content around rosacea so if you haven't checked out my video on eight things to know about rosacea or indeed on active ingredients to know about rosacea do settle in and watch those as well as always if you'd like this video hit like and subscribe so i know and i'll see you again very soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of natural medicine and founder of dr. axe calm in this video we'll go through natural rosacea treatments including the best essential oils the best vitamins and supplements the best herbs and diet to help you fight rosacea naturally and really the top seven natural treatment options now Before we jump into it let's talk about the root cause of rosacea and what it is it's a skin condition characterized by flares of redness and inflammation on your cheeks and affects 16 million people in the US alone often times can be correlated with spider veins the underlying cause is still largely unknown possible causes include overactive immune system leaky gut whole body problems but I will say this with in traditional Chinese medicine and TCM it's known that rosacea is caused by issues related to the liver and gallbladder or the lungs and the colon together and those things can all actually affect each other so it's flaring up those specific organs which I'll talk about more in a minute now in terms of diet the best diet includes a diet that is very high in organic fruits and vegetables moderate amounts of healthy fats such as flax seeds olive oil and even things like coconut lots of organic clean protein sources organic chicken and turkey grass-fed beef wild caught fish and anti-inflammatory foods and herbs and then I would even say to a degree whole grains like a sprouted whole rice that should be the base of a diet for rosacea now the big food you want to avoid I'll tell you right now we're gonna be alcohol and caffeine sugar and refined grains and processed foods conventional dairy and here's the big one fried foods and hydrogenated oils they cause something in the body called stagnation of the liver and gallbladder backing them up which can cause inflamed and red skin those are the biggest foods to avoid now another thing you want to do is you want to protect your face you want to get some sunlight but not get too much sunlight use natural sunscreens there as well and I don't even recommend making your own sunscreen with something that has a little bit of zinc oxide and maybe like geranium rose or rose essential oil something very gentle on the skin again geranium roses ideal or geranium now using natural moisturizers what I would recommend again is getting a natural moisturizer that's essential oil based and adding a little bit again geranium rose to it and making sure your cosmetics are gentle they're organic and they're not gonna clog up the pores on your skin now the other big thing you want to do is manage stress levels if you have anger frustration resentment impatience and those emotions specifically will really back up the liver gallbladder and can also affect the lungs and colon those organs that are chief they're responsible for those rosacea symptoms and again you want to be doing things like take a relaxing healing bath at night do yoga go outside an ideal thing to do is walk outside on trails that's why the most healing you think you can do again go and walking trails or hiking outside the most therapeutic thing you can do for overcoming rosacea now the big thing to know is understanding that these medications for treating rosacea do not treat the root cause of the condition so again again you always want to work with your physician but no this is not curing the problem and also know this new vitamin D receptor antagonists are newer therapeutic option but the big thing here get vitamin D or supplement vitamin D can help rosacea symptoms now here's what I'd recommend in terms of essential oils the top ones here being the most important if you want to use something cut topically I'd recommend Roman chamomile geranium oil rose oil or there's even a type called geranium rose so chamomile and geranium rose are gonna be the most beneficial essential oils at treating the problem now listen if you have very oily skin treat a tea tree oil can treat a lavender oil topically is very calming but these two chamomile and rhenium Rose are the best at treating rosacea and here's some other supplement options turmeric and ginger we now have great anti-inflammatory properties tumeric being up there nearing the near the top aloe vera raw honey bone broth collagen protein powders evening primrose oil all of these supplements are great for rosacea I would also mention supplements that really support eye moving the liver or supporting liver detoxification to particularly are going to be good milk thistle and buckler I'm okay milk thistle Boop lorem really support liver detoxification which is gonna help rosacea so those are probably my top two herbs milk thistle and Boo plum these are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and era Veda so remember this if you want to get rid of rosacea number one get hydrogenated oils out of your diet do more fruits vegetables and herbs you're gonna see great results because of that protect your face from the Sun or get a little Sun but not too much use natural moisturizers manage stress levels understand medications and use essential oils like Roman chamomile geranium rose and then again use more natural options and supplements such as Boo pleura and milk thistle are two of the best in digestive enzymes that are high in lipase if you've enjoyed this live training video on rosacea treatments

        "transcript": "sick of this this and this me too today we're going through my skincare philosophy and skincare routine for sensitive rosacea prone and acne prone skin this video has many parts I will leave timestamps down below so you can get to your favorite part or take it in whatever order you like this is not a sponsored video These are genuine products I love and use so bear with me I promise the products are good let's get into it hey guys it's Robin and welcome to the sence of selfcare on this channel we talk about health science we talk about life philosophy and we do a whole lot of self-care experimentation I'm very excited for today's video this is my most highly requested video of all time you guys have been asking for months and months for a skincare routine and I've been a little bit apprehensive to film this because I feel like my skin care is always changing and especially in the past year it's been through quite a transition but then I realized this is probably always going to be the case quick intermission after filming this I actually added another product which I'm very excited about and I'll talk about in this video that is how much my skin care is constantly evolving but more broadly this video isn't really about products I want to share a little bit of my skin care philosophy so that you can develop your own skin tuition this is a term I stole from gothamista she's an amazing skincare YouTuber so if you're skincare junkie definitely check out her Channel but basically developing your skin tuition means developing an intuition of what your specific skin needs at any one moment as the seasons change as our environments change as we age our skin is going to need different things by being a bit systematic with how we approach skincare and also paying attention to what our skin is doing with different products we can develop a really strong skin tuition and that can guide us through many different phases of life I never want anyone to forget that we are all our own expert of our own bodies and our own skin so I'll share my products today but just keep in mind that this is optimized for my skin for context I have oily acne prone and rosacea prone skin which is really the trifecta it's taught me a lot about skin and I'm grateful to be in a really good place with my body with kind of my sensitivity and inflammation also before I get into the topical parts of skin care I do of course need to mention that skinc care really starts from within so for me making sure that my diet and my lifestyle is not inflaming my body several years ago I was struggling with a bit of leaky gut which means that I was very inflamed and that was showing up on my skin as rosacea and acne so now my body is more in balance and that definitely shows on the outside that said topical skin care can make a huge difference there's a lot of clinical evidence to show that certain ingredients are extremely effective in changing our skin so it's this balance of first treating yourself on the inside making sure you're balanced done healthy there but also enhancing those results by being very conscious about what you're putting on top of your skin so before we get into products let's talk skin care philosophy this is really important because I can tell you about certain products that may or may not work for you but if your skincare philosophy is not in the right place it will make the development of your own skin tuition that much slower there's a few things I like to be very systematic about to help me learn very efficiently what works and what doesn't work for my skin so in science whenever we want to test something we only change one variable at a time by only changing one variable it's more likely that the results and the outcomes that we see are attributable to that variable so what this means for skinc care is that it's going to be a lot easier to learn what works for your skin if we are only changing one product at a time if we decide we want to do a whole skinc care overhaul and also change our toner and our sunscreen and also try a new sheet mask well then whatever results we get good or bad we won't really know which products are contributing to those results and it makes the process of learning and developing a skin tuition that much more confusing and slow so even though it seems very tedious to only change one product at a time it can really speed up your skincare learning in the long run because after several days you'll kind of understand what a new product does or doesn't do for your skin similarly I also like to do ab testing on my skins so we are blessed with sort of symmetrical faces that basically allow us to have two samples a base line control sample and a variable sample so again if you want to test a new moisturizer I would only put it on half of your face for several days and leave the other half using your old moisturizer so that you can really compare whether this new moisturizer is an improvement in your skincare routine or whether it's not an improvement maybe there's no difference but either way having this direct comparison makes it that much easier to see exactly what that product is doing to your skin so to review if you want to be efficient with with your skincare learning change one variable at a time that means change one product at a time and also do AB testing on your face meaning only put that new product on half of your face so that you have something to compare it to so if there's a product in this video that sounds interesting to you try introducing it on half of your face and try to keep everything else the same in your routine and see what it does for you maybe it does nothing maybe your skin hates it maybe it's life-changing for your skin I don't know but taking a systematic approach like this will make the whole process less confusing and much more efficient now let's get into the actual products that I use I'm first going to run through kind of a nighttime skincare routine then I'm going to share with you what I do during the day I also want to mention that none of these products are sponsored I am so picky about what I put on my face so for me having sensitive skin I want my products to be fragrance-free I want them to be alcohol free and I personally also need them to be Citrus oil free I've noticed that products with Citrus oils really irritate my skin so there's a few things that I look out for and all the products I will mention today are going to be sensitive skin safe the steps to my skincare routine are as follows the first step is a cleansing step then we have a watering step then we have a building step then a treating step and lastly a moisturizing step step one cleansing here I'm using the beauty of Josan radiance cleansing balm with rice and oat I love these ingredients they are so calming full of beta glue cans I will often make face masks at home using rice flour and oat flour so cheap so simple so I really like this cleansing balm it's very affordable and it's a pleasure to use I follow up a cleansing balm with a generic gentle cleanser here I was using Cetaphil I'm not too too picky about my cleansers I think there are many companies that have fragrance-free gentle cleansers the most important things for me here are that it's affordable and that it's not going to be stripping my skin the next step of my routine is my favorite step this is the watering step this is basically just soaking your skin with a hydrating essence or toner to add moisture to your skin this step will give you that glass skin glow from within I will usually do two to three layers of essence or until my skin feels saturated and plump I've heard someone describe this as being similar to watering a plant you just keep adding moisture until the soil is saturated both of these are great options the Madagascar Santella toner by skin1004 and the beauty of Joan Essence with Jin say right now I'm loving this cantella one the next step is all about building a healthy Skin Barrier this is when I use calming serums with ceramides and other peptides and probiotic ingredients that help support my skin and the healthy microbes that live on it again we don't want to strip our skin of bacteria we need those bacteria to protect us so here are two great options the cantella proboca ampule by skin 104 I am really loving this serum it is Affordable yet luxurious milky my skin really likes it too this one is price years but this Kate Somerville serum always helps keep my skin microbiome balanced next comes the treatment step and this is where I'll include any sort of active ingredients that help treat skin concerns like perhaps vitamin A products for texture or acids for acne if you have sensitive skin it's super important to be very conservative with this step here are a few products I use in my rotation this retinol Eye Serum by beauty of Josan is very gentle because it contains a retinol derivative so it's likely not going to irritate you and it's got a beautiful texture I have also been experimenting with this AIC acid by Polish Choice because there's a lot of research to support that AIC acid can be an effective treatment for rosacea if I'm honest I don't think it does much for my skin I don't think my skin really likes AIC acid but rosacea is such a personal thing this is a great product and worth trying if you do have rosacea because your rosacea might be responsive to it okay really quick rosacea what is it rosacea is a relatively common skin condition that primarily affects the face causing redness visible blood vessels swelling and sometimes small red pus filled bumps there are several different types of rosacea I personally have rosacea type 1 which is characterized by redness flushing and visible blood vessels rosacea runs in my family and for me personally it's exacerbated by certain foods digestive issues and the sun which is why you always see me wearing this crazy sun hat in all my videos but at its core rosacea is really an inflammatory disease which means things that reduce inflammation in our body will likely also help us avoid flareups and lastly I really like this metac Cube red cantella balm as an acne Spot Treatment it dries up breakouts without irritating my skin and you'll notice I've mentioned several products with cantella cantella is short for cantella asiatica which is a small herbaceous plant native to Asia it has anti-inflammatory properties it has wound healing properties it has many antioxidants it's moisturizing and my skin and rosacea do really seem to like this stuff okay pause real quick this treat step is where I have been experimenting the most recently and right after filming this video I got my order from agency which is so exciting this is not sponsored whatsoever agency does not know I exist but I have been eyeing their custom dermatologist prescribed formulas for a bit honestly I was not expecting it to work for me but man oh man I really really love this custom formula basically what you do is you upload a few photos of your face you have a little questionnaire that you fill in and you have a chat with a dermatologist and then they make you a custom formula this this is my custom future formula it has a small amount of troan which is what I'm very excited about troan is the most potent form of vitamin A and it can be really effective in treating both rosacea and acne if it is used responsibly and you build it up slowly so that is why you do need a prescription to use tretinoin so my skin has really been loving this stuff it's been happy and moisturized and hats off to this company for making prescription skincare far more accessible and a very pleasant experience and lastly we have the moisturizing step the goal here is to lock in all the beautiful things that we've just put on our face I use this very basic moisturizer from cave the nighttime Repair Cream it's full of ceramides and Shea Butter it's very occlusive it's going to lock all the good stuff in and it's affordable that's also relatively important to me because skinc care it can add up it's a recurring cost in our lives so let's keep it simple pull when we can as a bonus we have a very edgy step that I don't think dermatologists would approve of but through my AB testing on my face and lots of experimentation my skin just really really likes it it just really works for me and so I just want to be honest and share something that works but you know try it at your own risk essentially what I do as a very last step not always but often is I will put an entire zinc oxide mask on my face and what I'm using here is a fragrance-free diaper cream you want to be careful because a lot of diaper creams have ingredients like fragrances and other things that you don't want to leave on your skin all night but this one has pretty great ingredients and what I found is by putting a zinc oxide mask on my skin it really balances my oil production it gives me kind of this brightened glow it heals any sort of wounds very quickly I don't know something about it just works for my skin I'm embarrassed that I often go to bed like this if you're feeling a little adventurous I would try maybe first using zinc oxide cream as a spot treatment for any acne that comes up I keep going back to it and actually last year is when I first started using it and after I started using this people would tell me in real life that my skin was glowing but again this is so personal to me it may not work for you at all I'm just I felt obliged to share it because I really love it okay so quick little adjustments for the morning time I will do similar steps in the morning maybe light on the treatments but I will add in a lighter moisturizer and also a SPF and I keep going back to ELA MD as my favorite SPF it's not the best under makeup and it doesn't always play well with other moisturizers and products sometimes it pills a little bit but my skin genuinely loves this stuff I think cuz it contains niacinamide and a bunch of great ingredients for rosacea and acne it's developed specifically for rosacea and acne prone skin so I keep returning to ltmd okay one more intermission I want to show you the state of my rosacea here I typically get one professional IPL photo facial per year to manage the rosacea and redness that naturally comes up in my skin over time IPL facials are great at clearing out that pigment because the light specifically targets and destroys pigment and so this is something you can do in clinic but between my annual Clinic visit I will actually use an at home IPL device they're not going to be as strong as something you would get in an office of course but they work and they keep redness and discoloration at Bay and I really swear by them I would love to know what your favorite Holy Grail skin care tips tricks and products are please share with us down below I always learn so much from you guys in the comments thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you next time time",

        "transcript": "good morning little nerds I'm Dr Shireen Idris and welcome to Pillow Talk durm where we meet every Saturday morning to expand your brain and mind in the process if you have no idea who I am subscribe so you know what's good for you but I am a board certified dermatologist and today we are going to be focusing on rosacea because it is the last weekend of rosacea awareness month and I've taken pity on you flushed red human beings out there so we're going to focus on how to better identify your rosacea and help yourself but before I do that make sure you head on over to d r ris.com because I am starting a new newsletter that's going out every week that is purely educational focused from Dr eris.com so we'll be recapping some of the YouTubes we'll be focusing on new topics if you guys have questions make sure to email us at hello.com and we will make sure to incorporate those questions into that newsletter every week so head on over there I will link it below on the screen so back to rosacea what is it what causes it how do you identify it we're going to get in right now rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition it is not acne and I have to start off by saying this because as a Derm I get so annoyed when I see the marketing around ingredients for rosacea as acne but I understand why they do this and I'm going to let you guys in on something take for example sulfur which we're going to talk about in this video in order to get a drug fact label on a sulfur product so you can have a quote unquote medical indication for that ingredient you have to abide by what the FDA sees that ingredient fit for sulfur has traditionally been approved by the FDA for acne so they often write for example on sulfur purpose acne treatment and that's huge for a brand that they can actually say that so they're going to go ahead and run with it but sulfur is traditionally great for rosacea and not necessarily acne so I think in the process the public has gotten confused and started confusing the two and treating rosacea like acne but that is probably the worst thing you can do because it can disrupt your Skin Barrier more and it can inflame your rosacea worse in the process but I wanted you guys to understand this very nuanced thing so that you know as a person that rosacea is truly not acne it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is due to a multitude of different things we actually don't know exactly why you get it we do believe there is a genetic predisposition when you think of Rosa you think of a white person who gets really red but do not assume that darker skin tones can't have rosacea either it is just harder to detect and see but they can absolutely have rosacea too and it's usually due to a multitude of different factors from genetics chronic heat UV exposure a broken Skin Barrier little tiny mites like these called Demodex mites that are just going rampid on your skin we all have them some of us have them a little bit more than others and when they wake up and they're alive they tend to just mess up but deodex mites an overabundance of reactivity in terms of flushing etc etc etc and when you have a little bit of everything The Perfect Storm can show up on your face when you're nervous when you're stressed when you're hot when you're eating spicy foods when you're on a date you name it but there are really if you want to take a step back four main types of rosacea starting with the most common emodal ectatic rosacea Arial means red tantic means blood vessels rosesa is rosesa so when you have somebody who's red with a lot of broken blood vessels all over their face they have one of the most common forms known as the athematic type then you have the one that I think people get confused by that they confuse with adult acne papulo pular rosacea papules and P little red bumps and little tiny bumps all over your face usually along the cheeks the nose maybe a little bit here can sometimes happen along the chin interesting tip and this one's a good one you do not have blackheads in rosacea and with rosacea the nasal labial folds this area is spared so if you're having all of a sudden a breakout right here around your mouth it's probably not rosacea if it affects your nasal laal folds then you have the the third type which is like your old white uncle that you just can't or maybe you love or you just don't really like I don't know maybe I'm projecting but you have Fus rosacea where when you have chronic inflammation right and enlarged sweat glands the skin can appear thicker and your pores can look enlarged and your nose starts to get really distended and honestly deformed over time it can happen to your nose it can happen to your chin it can happen to your forehead that's the Fus type then the fourth type is ocular rosacea which people often Overlook completely but the eyes are usually affected in 50% of rosacea sufferers and what do you get with that you get blefaritis so inflammation along the eyelid margins you can get redness of the white part of your eye you have to take an eye hygiene into consideration but also when your eyes are affected and they're chronically inflamed especially the lid margins you want to calm that inflammation down so you don't f up your eyeballs in the process and have scratches on your corneil so that's usually an oral medication and that's why you shouldn't be scared of going on systemic medications but you should probably also see an opthalmologist and let them know about it so how can you then help yourself first without going into any sort of over-the-counter products or even prescription medications or in office treatments there's lifestyle and the things associated with lifestyle you're not going to like but this is the hard truth hot showers no steam no all of you weirdos love Hot Yoga that Take 5 hours to go in and out to actually do I tried doing it one year and I died no we don't do hot yoga spicy food I mean everything in moderation okay every once in a while it's fine but if you're going to eat like chili peppers with every meal you're going to mess up your Rosa alcohol caffeine chocolate a lot of chocolate can affect stress yes we need to start meditating in the morning certain medications the list goes on and on and on so you really do have to start listening to your skin and understanding how you're reacting to certain triggers whether it is sitting out in the sun or going into a hot yoga room or doing a steam or a sauna etc etc cooking maybe it's a perfect excuse for you not to cook and so you guys get the gist right make it work to your benefit so what are then the top ingredients that we can incorporate into our routine if we have rosacea and we're trying to help ourselves and I'm going to look for things that are calming and soothing that are going to help restore our Skin Barrier that are going to reduce inflam and that are basically Beyond The Gentle basic skin care that we think of when we think of basic sensitive skin like Cal oatmeal panol Etc glycerin we want to look for ingredients that are going to actively help reduce the look of that is the correct way of saying it if you are in the industry because you can't claim that it's reducing inflammation it's helping reduce the look of inflammation and redness number one and this is probably the most popular one on the market that I think a lot of Ros of people know about and look for directly Santella atica Santella atica is known for redness reducing properties anti-inflammatory properties it has atico sdes medas aides and aziatic acid in it which all have anti-inflammatory effects and it reduces the look of inflammation it has been shown also just side note to promote collagen production so and it also has certain antioxidants that can protect the skin from the damage caused by free radicals obviously full disclosure my brand the depuffer why do I love this product if you have rosacea because it is loaded in centella asiatica but it also has arnica and arnica is not one that is traditionally thought of for rosacea but it works like a charm because it helps reduce the redness and calms the inflammation in a synergistic way that your skin looks def flushed within a couple of minutes when done correctly at the right concentration arnica is tricky though because when you guys look for arnica products more often than not they're diluted in a homeopathic fashion this one is purely Brown because it is pure arnica the color that you guys see here this golden hue is due to the high concentration of arnica in this formulation then you have one that a lot of people with rosacea know about Dr jart Dr jart has his tiger grass which is another name for cantella asiatica color correcting treatment it's a mineral sunscreen with zinc and titanium and it has a green tint to it and a more opaque fashion versus this that is going to help neutralize the look of redness because when you're red you want green to block the red we're not going to go into the art of it take an art course that's not my jam although I do like painting number two we have sulfur I hinted at sulfur at the beginning of this video sulfur is going to be marketed as an acne treatment I.E like on this when you see eradicate daily foaming cleanser acne treatment because it has 3% sulfur but it's not really just an acne treatment it's a rosacea treatment why because sulfur helps to minimize inflammation it regulates seen production a lot of people with rosacea have a lot of overproduced seim think of the nose think of the chin and it also helps to minimize inflammation as well it has antimicrobial properties which is helpful right but not the main reason of why it works and it has mild exfoliating properties but it's not going to over strip you and Break Your Skin Barrier worse making your rosacea flare up in the process there's another product by pieter Thomas Roth they have a 10% sulfur clay mask which is much more potent than the cleanser form and then you have one available at your local drugstore called Dela Cruz where you can literally spend a couple of bucks smell like a rotten egg and improve your skin in the process so those are the sulfur products that are high up at number two when it comes to ingredients number three is AAL acid AAL acid is an ingredient that I have a honestly more of a love love relationship with a little bit of a hate because it's not elegant it pills and it messes up a formula when you mix it with other actives at the right% and in order to use aoic acid if you have rosacea you really want to be at 10% or above but above that is prescription and prescription is 15% which is sweet spot and I don't know how the prescription is formulated but it's so elegant finaa is so elegant and I do not get paid by that drug company whatsoever um but it's a 15% prescription on to over the- counter though we have paa choice this is a 10% AIC acid booster I believe um it has a little bit of licorice it does have salicylic acid I don't know the percent of Sal acid in this if you're sensitive or you think your barrier is inflamed beware don't go for it because the Sal acid might mess you up but AIC acid like I said regul Ates your anti-inflammatory properties and antibacterial properties and it helps as an antioxidant as well Dr Sam bunting across the pond in the UK has her Flawless nightly serum which is a 10% aoic acid serum as well it has 5% niacinamide it does have a Ester form of vitamin C at 2% so it's not going to be the active form of vitamin C but it might be a nice one if you are a rosacea sufferer trying to use vitamin see in the morning wanting to get away with some AIC acid I hear beautiful things I started looking into it because of you guys dming me about it so that is hers and then the ordinary this one's great at night when you have nowhere to go and you don't care who you're seeing it is a 10% a acid suspension you do kind of sometimes have to shake it I feel but it appears nice and elegant but it does pill after a while so do not be fooled by the first impression with this it's 11 bucks though so you not really go wrong and then like I said prescription number four hypochlorous acid you guys have started hearing about this all over Instagram Tik Tok YouTube I don't know what else you guys are on I can't keep up with the social media platforms but hypochlorous acid is one that has been used in medicine for decades I actually use it before every cosmetic procedure to clean my patients faces because it has antimicrobial effects and it is gentle so it's not going to over strip their skin like using plain oil isopropyl alcohol or an alcohol wipe it is now available in fancier forms at nicer stores but you can also get it at your local drugstore as a generic this is one that is available at Walgreens it is really not that expensive at all and you can use it every day on your face in the morning and at night if you're somebody who wears a mask for whatever reason at the height of the pandemic I used to spray my mask with hypoc chloris acid to minimize the breakout around the mouth area number five this is one that people don't often think of when they have rosacea a lot of people with rosacea think they have chronically dry skin over here it's always flaking but then when I ask my patients is your skin dry or oily they go it's more oily but it flakes okay it's not dry skin it's not flaking because it's dry it is a yeast living on your skin and you have dandruff of your face a lot of rosacea patients have dandruff of their face around their eyebrows right here in the corners of their nose or even along their eyelid margins and you can even see it sometimes in front of their ears and they need ketoconazol neral shampoo is an anti-dandruff shampoo for the scalp that you can use a couple of times a week on your face to keep that yeast at Bay okay um it's an anti-fungal medicine that can help really help your face and I think when that is sort of subsided and you calm the subar dermatitis down you minimize the inflammation associated with it and your redness gets better in the long run so this is something that you're going to have to incorporate throughout the course of your life and you have to figure out the Cadence of how you want to incorporate it the shampoo is not necessarily the best as a face wash because it's not the ideal pH it might be a little bit stripping but if you use it several times periodically maybe twice a week maybe it's four times a week maybe it's once a week I don't know what the right Cadence is for you and you do it in the areas that are actually the worst letting it sit for a few minutes before washing it off you will see a huge difference in your skin in the long run also just side note I use the shampoo right here I've been using it right here when I wash my hair I let it sit for 5 minutes not because I have dandruff but because I have thinning hair there and I have noticed that my hair is starting to get thicker poor AI okay number six benzil peroxide and you're going to go wait wait wait wait wait is benzil peroxide and adne medication yes it is is it great for rosacea no it's not but if you have this little Mite called a Demodex Mite out of control on your face then benzil peroxide can be helpful for you now not all rosacea people have Demodex mites going crazy on their face but a lot of them do and the way I hear it described from my patients is that they feel like their skin is a little bit reactive and itchy not painful not irrit ated but just like this is probably the get your mind out of the gutter okay but this is probably the best action I can describe it as okay but benzil peroxide can help kill it now you don't need a 10% benzil peroxide wash stronger isn't better something like at 5% we have this in my office is great it's going to help kill that bacteria the little mites and keep it at Bay all right FYI because of the drug fact label benzil peroxide comes up as acne but this can be helpful for Demodex mites as well okay number seven my favorite zinc oxide no it's not sunscreen I'm talking about diaper rash cream Triple Paste zinc oxide is a beautiful ingredient it has anti-inflammatory effects when a kid has a rash down there you slap this all over their little tushies in a gentle way in order to minimize their rash to calm the inflammation down so they have less friction Etc on their privates when it comes to your face if you have an inflamed Skin Barrier and you're trying to restore your barrier zinc oxide can really help restore that barrier and when it comes in the form of a diaper rash cream when it's married to petrolatum it will help create an occlusive layer while calming any inflammation down and it works wonders as an overnight mask treatment especially in a dry climate or in a very cold climate or when the temperatures are changing not all diaper rash creams are created equal don't go for one with essential oils definitely don't and make sure there's no steroid in it cuz that can make things worse I was sponsored by this company after I spoke about them it was a very organic thing and that's why I took that sponsorship because I was like how funny Would it be that the one sponsorship I'm excited about is a buttpaste company but this is probably my favorite one not because of that sponsorship I have two kids who are six and four I wasn't sponsored then but this was the one that I used on my kids so that is the diaper rash cream k for that and then we're going to talk about options for quickly prescriptions but we're not going to waste too much time on this because you can't prescribe medications for yourselves at least not as of yet but who knows what the future holds but aik acid 15% that's great you want to incorporate that metronidazol is a topical antibiotic that you guys can use it's been very well studied for rosacea it is also beautiful and santra which is the trade name the generic name is itin is an antiparasitic that also kills Demodex I often times prescribe all three and I tell patients go plop ploop ploop put three dots mix mix mix apply to face twice a day and it really does help a lot with people with rosacea to help keep all of it at Bay and you can use this long term you can use aoic acid when you're pregnant you can use metronidazol when you're pregnant and last I checked you can use cilantro when you're pregnant in office we can take it up a notch and you guys can really help yourselves by reducing the Cosmetic look of redness by getting the beams vascular laser beams also pulse known as the pulse die laser which in my book is the gold standard you guys might get Groupon deals for ipls or bbls for rosacea it doesn't work as well an IPL and a BBL is a light it is not a laser you're going to need a lot more treatments and you better be going to somebody who is qualified because you might get burnt in the process because they are not as specific as a laser and you need to know what you're doing with them in order to treat your rosacea correctly and then if you have enlarged sweat glands on your nose or on your chin you can do electr surgery you can shave it down people actually use sandpaper believe it or not in conjunction with other devices and lasers to help minimize the look of that but you're probably not watching this video I am assuming if that is your case and you have timeus changes on your nose um because it's usually older white men who get that so I don't think they're watching this YouTube um but that is pretty much what we can do the bird ey view in office and the last thing I want to just say is rosacea might appear like a very benign chronic condition but it has a really deep psychological influence and psychosocial impact on people knowing that you're flushing when you're embarrassed makes you more embarrassed and makes it worse as somebody who has had 10 V beams in one year yes 10 why because I would go to the gym and I would get stopped on the street when I was working out and they would ask me do you need to go to the hospital are you okay cuz I looked like a beat I wasn't red I was like purple red and so I told myself let me just treat this with the vbm and I ended up doing 10 one year and I maintain it probably with one or two treatments a year now I treat my whole face it is really psychologically draining thinking oh my God are my emotions showing on my face and my ears so don't just down for rosacea awareness month and if you guys have any questions or comments as always leave them below but I hope you have a beautiful Saturday [Music]",

        "transcript": "good morning my little skin nerds i am dr shereen idris a cosmetic dermatologist based in new york city i am sorry if i sound congested i have really bad allergies at the moment and yes i used my flonase not to roll my face but to my nose um and also for those of you who are going to ask me my son had budded me last night in the bed uh because he's also sick and um yeah that's why i have that on my lip so what are we talking about today today we are going to address a topic that many people often refer to as nature's blush which i find honestly not very amusing because i have rosacea and i've had massive flare-ups in the sense where after working out or after going to a spicy restaurant or whatever i would walk out and my face was no joke the color of this cap or like this and i was stopped on the street where people asked me if i needed help because i was so intensely flushed that being said i understand that rosacea although might appear you know futile or benign can actually have deeper psychological impacts on people so it is not something to be taken lightly like oh your face is just a little pink sometimes your face can be more than a little pink and it can definitely take a toll on your mental psyche plus over time the redness can start to look ruddy and with that readiness people start to feel a little bit down and so i do think it's important to try to treat it earlier on rather than later because in the earlier stages you can actually get control over the flare-ups and the residual redness that's left behind what is rosacea rosacea is oftentimes considered adult acne it's a chronic condition an inflammatory condition my husband just jumps in the shower that comes and goes depending on what is triggering it it is definitely a nuisance and annoying but it can also have longer physical effects particularly on the eyes what do we see with rosacea we see facial flushing after a hot shower after spicy foods after working out when you're stressed anxious etc you can have residual broken blood vessels the squiggly little lines left on the face and those are called telangiectasias and they do get bigger and worse over time and you also get breakouts of papules and pustules particularly on your cheeks your nose so that is sort of what rosacea picture looks like what we don't see in rosacea and this is sort of a point of debate particularly among dermatologists splitters versus lumpers blackheads blackheads are usually a sign of just acne not rosacea particularly and so that is a point of differentiation so if you have a lot of blackheads you most likely don't have rosacea who usually gets rosacea most likely it's women more so than men between the ages of 30 to 50. that and any white person most people with skin types one through three that's not to say if you have a darker skin type you can't have rosacea i have seen it in skin types four and five but as we get darker you know after you get more melanated it's harder to see that flush it's harder to see the broken blood vessels and it's harder harder to fully appreciate a rosacea picture so i would say most white people because honestly it's what you actually see all right what are the causes of rosacea the actual picture of what causes rosacea is still not fully understood that's okay and that's like a lot of things in dermatology there is a genetic predisposition you know if you look at your family members and they have it you most likely have it too there are vascular changes there are vascular changes on the surface of your skin where our blood vessels slowly dilate and get more pronounced and that can lead to a worsening rosacea picture heat for example is a no-no and we'll talk about that in a second because it causes those blood vessels to dilate and to get worse to make the flushing worse uv exposure so the sun is definitely not helpful if you have underlying or bad rosacea because it does also cause that vasodilation that swelling that worsening of that inflammation um microbial changes on your skin i know the microbiome is the hot topic today um but there is some merit to that we're not talking about that tonight it's going to be a way longer video but there is microbial changes and mites on our skin also known as demodex mites that can actually worsen the inflammation and worsen the overall picture of rosacea and finally the disruption of your skin barrier so over exfoliating over scrubbing overdoing really stripping your skin of its natural barrier can make your rosacea picture much worse so once you have that in mind you're gonna kind of know how to tackle the problem and treat it and finally triggers what triggers rosacea so they're gonna tell you they the dermatologist those people are gonna tell you to avoid all the good stuff avoid chocolate avoid spicy food avoid heat avoid alcohol which i don't avoid any of the for okay do i try to minimize the overall exposure am i doing steam baths every day no i'm not i do try to minimize the exposures obviously i'm not a raging alcoholic i don't eat a ton of chocolate i do eat a ton of chocolate i try to minimize how much spicy food i eat but at the end of the day if you can try to minimize those triggers it's only going to help because all of what i just described again causes your blood vessels to dilate causing more blood flow to your skin causing worsening of your inflammation and over time worsening of the residual effects of rosacea so how can we treat it with at least over-the-counter treatments and what you can do to help yourself from the comfort of your supermarket local pharmacy etc if you're looking for a brand and i am not endorsed by this brand to try to help with any sort of underlying redness there is a french brand known as aven which is very famous because it does trigger underlying redness this is their mist i have a cleanser by them the xero column cleanser but this one is probably more for dry examiner skin they have a cleanser for redness and i'm going to put a picture of it here which i would recommend that you try and as well as their moisturizer line hyrum just came out with a skincare line selfless by hiram and i actually was very impressed by his green tea and sentella face wash because it is very very soothing and i thought this would be a good time to demo it um because i really do think it can help especially with people who have underlying redness um centella asiatica also known as sikka has been around for centuries especially in the far east and sikka has redness reducing properties so this is his gel cleanser it is a very gentle gel cleanser it has no scent because it's hi-rim he's fragrance opposed but it is a very good cleanser especially if you have sensitive skin and if you have underlying rosacea the other sika brand that i always talk about that people should be looking into if they have a lot of redness is dr jart's sick appear line this one does have the tiger grass serum which is the sickest serum which is centella asiatica they also have a sycapair color correcting moisturizer which looks green but when you apply it we should do a test actually so it's green and it helps to minimize the effects of redness obviously if you're somebody of skin type 4 5 6 darker in tone this might not be for you but again you're probably not affected by underlying rosacea to the degree that somebody as white as myself is so it comes on as green but as you blend it in it just helps to mask any underlying redness so you can kind of see that let's try to get a little blemish here there you go so sica is one of those ingredients that can help correct especially when it's in a thicker green base the appearance of the redness now the best ingredient for treating rosacea in an over-the-counter treatment is honestly though azelaic acid azolic acid is one of those like kind of unicorn ingredients that we don't know exactly how it works it does have anti-inflammatory properties and depending on its percentage can definitely help personally i think 15 which is prescription is the most effective 15 to 20 percent obviously not everybody has access to prescriptions and so over the counter you have azolic acid by paula's choice it is a 10 booster it smells really bad i don't know i would have preferred something to kind of help mask it obviously though you might have sensitive skin but it does kind of smell stale and it does get grainy the reason azolic acid products pill in general and this is one by the ordinary they have an azolic acid 10 suspension because it is a suspension because azelaic acid is a powder and because it is a powder it has to be suspended and because it is suspended it tends to pill once it dries out so i would use it more so at night if you feel that it is not being as elegant as you want it to be underneath your makeup because they can definitely as you can see i don't know if you guys can see but here can you see that it's pilling underneath my fingers because again it is a powder but it is one of the best ingredients on the market to help actually calm the inflammation not necessarily the redness associated with rosacea which leads me to now one of my favorite ingredients arnica and arnica does have some soothing properties it is one of those homeopathic ingredients that is often used for um bruises hi mila let's go hi i said hi um so arnica is one of those ingredients that have some soothing properties there's a couple of brands out there um i've never been 100 impressed by the brands but they are available you have the arnicare brand as well as bioderma i did buy this one though in this caribbean so i don't know if you can buy this in the u.s i'm pretty sure you can buy this in france um the sika bio arnica plus which i prefer to the arctic hair arnica is a yellow ingredient and so it does tend to yellow over time it does not make it less effective but just something to kind of think about if you have a lot of inflammation worth trying on your face but if you are extremely sensitive i would approach with caution and finally when you have rosacea you're also more likely than not to have face dandruff which is basically flaking and greasiness especially around here around your eyebrows and so you can get over the counter nizeral which is ketoconazole one percent shampoo and this helps to kill that superficial yeast that is causing that flaking and greasiness and the reason you have it is because your ph and your skin is just more prone to it and finally i did touch about having mites on your skin a lot of us have them we're just not prone to being irritated by them especially if our skin barrier is intact but if it is not intact benzoyl peroxide and penoxyl can help this one is 10 i would say just be careful if you're very sensitive as it can also irritate your skin so you want to maybe use a benzoyl peroxide wash that is not as strong something within the 2.5 to 5 percent concentration but if you can't find it a little bit of penoxyl mixed with another cleanser such as this one by ave or by hiram's cleanser to help dilute it a little bit can actually help keep those mites at bay so that is it in a nutshell for over-the-counter treatments that you can use to help yourself with rosacea i personally have come a long way figuring out what works best for my face but also i have gone into laser treatments which we will do another video about on another day so i will catch you guys soon i'm dr shireen idris i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned something today um if you have please like subscribe comment below and let me know any other kind of videos or topics you guys want me to cover next have a great day you",

        "published_at": "2023-03-30T13:00:19Z",
        "transcript": "now if there's one thing I know about it's redness and a tendency to rosacea and I have learned that the most important thing are my daily habits when it comes to managing my skin now any redness or rosacea sufferer will know that the wrong skin care habits can really be one of the biggest triggers around and that's why it's so important to put together the right supportive skin care routine with the right actives to manage your skin I truly believe that azelaic acid takes pride of place when building an effective redness solution skin care plan so azelic acid is brilliant in redness prone skin and rosacea because it changes the way the skin senses the environment so part of the issue with rosacea is that we overreact to things like UV exposure and harsh winds so I've always likened it to the fire alarm in the kitchen going off when the kettle boils rather than when the oven is on fire the same thing is true for our skin in rosacea now that's because of something called toll-like receptors and the dial is turned right up so these are over sensitive and they overreact leading to things like vasodilatation so the blood vessels in the skin open up changes in Skin Barrier function flushing and then blemishes so papules and pustules now the great thing about azelaic acid it turns the dial right down products that I recommend that contain azelic acid include the inculus 10 percent acetic acid serum the ordinary is the original 10 azoic acid suspension and Flawless brightly serum which has also got 10 azelic acid in combination with three other actives the next active ingredient I think is worth considering is niacinamide now this barrier loving B vitamin is an asset for two reasons firstly it does make the Skin Barrier that bit stronger and more resilient and we know that decreased barrier function is part of the reason why rosacea prone skin behaves so sensitively so that's because of increased ceramide production bolstering your Skin's barrier function and then secondly it's anti-inflammatory and we know triggers in down of why niacinamide is so helpful I think many of us saw this at first hand during the pandemic when wearing masks not only aggravated acne but also tended to aggravate rosacea and niacinamide was a real hero ingredient in that context now products that contain niacinamide include the garden of wisdom's five percent niacinamide serum or as I mentioned Flawless brightly serum also contains niacinamide with azureic acid for ease now the next ingredient I want you to think about for treating redness prone skin might not seem like an active but to me it is and that's physical sunscreen I have patients genuinely appreciate the value of mineral sunscreen and actually improving their rosacea and redness you know are separate to the benefits that they achieve from their actives and I think it's that important because at the end of the day most of the people affected by rosacea tend to have light skin and light eyes and we know they're at risk of premature aging and possibly uncontrolled inflammation might accelerate that so we want to protect the dermis as much as possible so daily sunscreen is a non-negotiable the other thing is that physical sunscreen can often just make the skin look better it has light reflecting properties and if tinted can really give a nice evening out of the skin tone which on good skin days can often mean you can get away with just using concealer personally I cannot live without a lightly tinted sunscreen I'm a Flawless gossamer tint one addict as many of you will know but finding that minerals sunscreen that makes you feel confident even on a day when your Skin's a little on the pink side is a real godsend now introducing a retinoid into redness prone skin or indeed rosacea can seem risky idea after all they're associated with irritation and potentially dryness and scaling however when redness prone skin is calm or your rosaceous in the maintenance phase they actually have quite a lot to offer so firstly they may actually improve the tendency for abnormal red blood vessels to appear so the development of those fixed broken capillaries that we associate with redness prone skin secondly they have a role in re-densifying the dermis so after all we know that those with light skin and light eyes are more at risk of rosacea they're also more at risk of premature aging and we really want all that collagen and elastin hyaluronic acid the structure of proteins that make the skin thick firm and resilient so I'm a big fan of retinoids introduced in the right way at the right time and in the over-the-counter space I think when acts of retinoid has to be one of the best ways to do this in a gentle and reassuring fashion products you can try include the inky list Gran active retinoid the skin rocks retinoid one or Flawless nightly serum if you want to try your retinoid in combination with azelaic acid and niacinamide one more skin care consideration for you is Ivermectin now this is available on prescription hence I'm mentioning it last but it is something to think about if you are getting frequent flare-ups with papules and pustules and redness now in rosacea redness comes about for a number of reasons firstly those broken capillaries can lead to a permanent redness in the cheeks typically but also in the nose and the chin now the blemishes of rosacea can also leave redness behind so post-inflammatory pigmentation can create redness on the skin so as a separate way in which the skin can Redden and then the Third Way is simply through barrier just function that can lend itself to the skin becoming irritating now for me azaleaic acid is excellent at down down the inflammation making the skin look less pink and then Ivermectin or cilantro as it's known on prescription helps to reduce the incidence of those papules in pustules so it is really helpful for an inflammatory flare-up of your rosacea now I tend to use cilantro for inflammatory bursts and then I will plan to wean someone off that onto azulaic acid for maintenance and then I'll just reuse it as often as is needed to help the patient control their flares the good thing about ongoing use of azulaic acid is that over time I find that you get fewer and fewer flare-ups and you get better and better control and in addition to that you also get the nice skin conditioning benefits you get improved texture you get better looking pores and an overall brighter appearance to the skin whilst also helping them achieve the best possible complexion they can so as I've discovered it is really worthwhile having a long-term plan when it comes to a Rosy complexion because unfortunately it does tend to hang around as a tendency however putting in the right groundwork using the right products can lend themselves to improving your skin immeasurably whilst also controlling your redness so it's work that's worthwhile and I hope you find the recommendations in today's video is helpful so if I've convinced you that azaleaic acid is right for you might want to watch My ultimate beginner's guide to using azaleaic acid to give you a foolproof plan for getting started I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you again soon bye for now",

        "transcript": "the three best ingredients to treat rosacea and how they work and yes we're talking both prescriptions and over-the-counter rosacea is a condition that a lot of people deal with but not a lot of people understand and we've actually gone into depth about what triggers rosacea what makes it worse and what some of the causes are believed to be now rosacea is a medical condition that needs to be diagnosed by a doctor or dermatologist but a lot of people struggle with it not realizing that they have it it's characterized by this red flushing of the skin specifically if you come in contact with something that is a trigger so for instance hot or cold foods if you drink alcohol like wine or even changes in weather or sun exposure and for some people this can be genetic people who have celtic backgrounds or genes often struggle with more rosacea it's usually seen in fitzpatrick photosensity types one to three and although it can happen to anyone at any time it usually happens as people get a little bit older sometimes in the 40s or 50s it tends to show up but we've already done a video on rosacea and speaking about the different stages for instance papulo pustular rosacea can sometimes look like acne and sometimes people get it wrong which is why it's important to see a derm to make sure you know whether it's acne or whether it is rosacea and for some people they can actually struggle with ocular rosacea which is very painful as well as a related condition rhinophyma which can actually disfigure the nose now while we have that entire video available what are some of the best ingredients that you can look for again either over the counter or through a prescription there are quite a few and we are going to go through all of them starting with some that dermatologists and doctors actually recommend topical ivermectin has been used for years and it's generally well tolerated meaning that people don't usually have irritation or redness which is one of the main issues of rosacea anyways topical ivermectin is known to be anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic now this is interesting because of some of the things that are related to rosacea specifically demodex mites demodex mites are a part of our biology they are these little mites that literally live in and on our skin and unfortunately for people who have rosacea there seems to be some sort of a link between these demodex mites and rosacea flare-ups and topical ivermectin has been shown to help get rid of some of those demodex mites as well as be anti-parasitic in general it can really help with the inflammation as well some of that papillopustular rosacea but again this is a medication so it needs to be prescribed by a dermatologist or doctor this is one that i get regularly for my acne but they basically combine different ingredients together and they actually have other ingredients as well such as metronidazole now this metronidazole is another ingredient that is commonly used for rosacea it's a type of antibiotic and if you've seen a doctor or derm they might have given you oral antibiotics but antibiotics can also be used topically on the skin metronidazole is a great one and again it's been proven to help with rosacea time and time again but it also helps with erythema or that redness as well as being anti-inflammatory now what is that gold standard in dermatology for acne for wrinkles that also helps with hyperpigmentation retin-a or tretinoin and yes retin-a or this vitamin a tretinoin can also be used for rosacea retinoids in general have been proven to be helpful for rosacea especially the type that is papillopustular so the ones that kind of have those little pimples because tretinoin helps to speed up skin cell proliferation and basically tell your body to create new skin cells faster it allows the skin to thicken at the dermis and thin out at the top layers which can create this luminous retinoid glow that we often see but yes this can be helpful for people who have acne as well as for people who have rosacea or a combination of rosacea and acne now do remember you have to see a dermatologist or a doctor to get a diagnosed but also b to get these things prescribed to you and although you could get them separately you could also get them all blended or customized into one that is what germatica does they are one of the prescription brands that i've been using it's because of dr mamina she's one of my favorite doctors and dermatologists on tiktok and she both loves dermatica and works with them regularly now this is my blend so it's going to be different than anyone else's but mine is made for acne as well as some of the subclinical rosacea that i do have but i think it was last year that dermatica did release kind of a rosacea option so they basically have this metronidazole they basically have this topical ivermectin and they can blend these in together to a custom treatment for someone who needs it now they also have over the counter things which are going to talk about such as things like niacinamide that is what's personally in my blend but essentially they have doctors online who can actually take a look at your skin help assess it digitally and then provide you a custom blended prescription with actives that are actually chosen for your skin so they have a better chance of working for you they come every single month so every 28 days and they are 25 a month but the good news is that they do have sales i've worked with them in the past and we're working with them again on this video and they actually have a discount where you get the first month completely free the second month is 19.99 and then it goes up to 25. i've been using this for my acne but it does work for rosacea and again yours is not going to be the same as mine everyone's as different because it is custom blended but do remember that you have to get these ingredients prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist and that also goes for the ingredient bromonidine bromonidine is often used in medicine for things like glaucoma but it is actually helpful topically for rosacea as well it works as a vasoconstrictor meaning that it constricts blood vessels and for those who have this redness this flushing with rosacea this bromonidine can really really help again all of these have to be prescribed but what if you're like hey i do want some over-the-counter options is there anything available they're not going to be as strong or as effective as prescription but yes there are a few things you should know about the first one is azelaic acid azolic acid is one of the dicarboxylic acids that is amazing for rosacea and it's actually really good for acne as well it really works for the pimples and the redness that are associated with rosacea and it kind of tells the skin just to calm itself down it really is soothing on the skin and you can get a prescription form of azelaic acid if you get a higher dose but if you wanted something over the counter the ordinaries is great but dr sam also has a fantastic one this one is the neutralizing gel this has azelaic acid but it's combined with salicylic acid that bha that we know and love for acne if you are someone who struggles with rosacea but you also have acne this is going to be one of the best products you can get this is one of my favorite products that i've ever used you can use it as a spot treatment or you can smooth it all over but if you're just looking for azelaic acid and you're a little bit more price conscious this one from the ordinary is great this is the azolic acid suspension 10 this one can come off a little bit grainy but for like seven to eight bucks the price is right and again that is the active ingredient that really helps with the redness and some of those little pustules that are associated with rosacea another really good over-the-counter option is vitamin b3 or niacinamide we love niacinamide because it brightens the skin it helps our skin create ceramides and strengthen our skin barrier and regulate oil production and also helps with hyperpigmentation but a lot of people don't realize that it helps with rosacea as well again my little dermatica prescription does include niacinamide depending on what your doctor recommends for you yours might or yours might not but i really love this to smooth over my forehead and my nose and kind of my chin where i do get my oiliest and where i do kind of struggle with my little subclinical rosacea flares niacinamide is really great because it's very stable meaning it plays very well with almost all other ingredients in a skincare routine and some people are afraid of niacinamide and vitamin c but you really shouldn't be if you're mixing niacin with 100 vitamin c then maybe that's a concern but when it comes to niacinamide over the counter even if you do have a vitamin c in your routine i wouldn't worry about it but we've actually done videos on that entire topic which i will link down below niacinamide is fantastic for rosacea as well as if you do have hyperpigmentation and if you're someone that struggles with both or if you end up picking your lesions and they leave little marks behind niacinamide is a great over-the-counter option now what i find so unfortunate about rosacea treatment and education is that most people miss one of the main components spf our bff the sun is one of the biggest triggers for rosacea and we know that people who go in the sun or if they get sun exposure it can often cause rosacea to flare and then to worsen over time not to mention we know that the sun also contributes to hyperpigmentation to acne scarring left over and it degrades collagen which can cause wrinkles and fine lines spf is your bff for a reason and yes that includes rosacea sunscreens are some of the best products you can use to both treat and prevent rosacea as well as skin cancer now when it comes to rosacea there are different sunscreens for different people some people are going to like the cosmetic elegancy elegancy elegant is elegancy a word no it's elegance some people do like the cosmetic elegance of a chemical slash organic formula this is one of my favorites that has hyaluronic acid it's super hydrating from isn't tree this is a great option but for some people especially if you have kind of pustular rosacea some of the chemical sunscreens can sting so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a mineral option this is one of my favorites this is the zinc screen from super goop this is 100 mineral and those mineral formulas are made with things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this one has zinc oxide and those are usually a little bit more gentle on skin especially if you are someone who has a lot of sensitivities spf is one of the best things for rosacea and especially if you use some of these together you can really create a great routine that not only treats rosacea but also prevents future flare-ups i've left a list of some of my favorite rosacea products below as well as an actual rosacea skincare routine if you want an entire guide but if you also want one month of dramatica free as well as that discount for 19 and then for 25 i will also leave that and a code below for you do remember that dramatica doesn't just help with rosacea they also have these custom blended formulas that can help with things like fine lines and wrinkles like acne which is what i use as well as for things like hyperpigmentation but again that is for a dermatologist to look at your skin and address and assess and then create a custom blended formula to meet your needs another thank you to dermatica for number one introducing me to dr mamina who i love and adore and number two for working with us on this video as well as helping make this rosacea education and information possible but remember this is not medical information that's for your doctor to give you do remember to reapply your spf especially if you have rosacea and always remember to be youtiful both inside and out i love you beautiful butterflies and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye you",

new here I'm Dr Finbar a family doctor now specializing in dermatology and on this channel I help you learn to love the skin you're in and enhance your skin health for longevity I often tell my patients that I flare up on their rosacea is similar to how a warning light flashes on the dashboard of a car just as the car has sensors built in to let you know it needs some attention or a trip to the garage so too can our bodies communicate with us and warn us that something is wrong the problem is that we don't understand the message as facial redness doesn't tell us exactly what or where the problem is and it can lead to further frustration and psychological upset this is why today I'm taking a holistic approach to the management of rosacea what it is how it affects your emotional health lifestyle and dietary factors I'll also cover prescription medical treatment options so be sure to watch to the end of the video for all of that information rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness small bumps and visible blood vessels it commonly affects the cheeks nose and forehead but it can also appear on the neck chest and ears there are several types of rosacea and I'm not going to go deep into all the individual subtypes in this video but it's important to know a little bit about them as different interventions may be required for each subtype from a diagram a medical staff the subtypes include populism postures these dome-shaped papules often appear in clusters with or without pustules some patients develop deeper nodules also then we have a fair flushing frequent and prolonged flushing is common with rosacea but is more noticeable in patients with lighter skin talangectase are dilated blood vessels commonly visible in patients with rosacea in-depth examination of rosacea patients with darker skin may also reveal these changes even if they aren't immediately visible to the naked eye rosacea can affect the patient's eyes some of the most common signs or symptoms around the eyes include bloodshot eyes redness around the eyelid margin styes crusty accumulation at the base of the eyelashes changes to the patient's skin include a bulbous appearance of the nose glandular hyperplasia or overgrowth and skin thickening I should also mention perioral dermatitis some researchers consider perioral dermatitis to be a variant of rosacea perioral dermatitis is a rash that appears around the mouth and nose and it's often mistaken for acne so although there are seemingly multiple subtypes and variants of rosacea the common condition of rosacea isn't just about the rash the psychological and emotional effects can go well beyond the visual rash what causes rosacea is not an easy question to answer now while there's strong hereditary component to rosacea having the genetics for it doesn't mean that you're destined to get it the strong links also between rosacea and gosh health and I'll be talking about that in more detail soon rosacea has multiple triggers that contribute to its development and severity so if you want to get rid of your rosacea it's best to take a holistic approach that addresses all these areas which I'm going to talk about namely emotional health lifestyle and dietary measures and then Medical Treatments now while there are certain things that seem to trigger most rosacea sufferers like sunlight other triggers such as dietary triggers like eating tomatoes or Nightshade plants may only affect a small number of rosacea sufferers occasionally rosacea can be brought on by or made worse by the use of steroid creams given to treat eczema I think emotional health is often ignored misunderstood or brushed over by doctors as we reach for our prescription pods under emotional health I include your mental health mindset spiritual health and health in our relationships while emotional issues may or may not directly cause rosacea they can certainly exacerbate it living with rosacea often brings emotional challenges that further impact the condition for instance consider the case of one of my patients let's call her GM now Jane had been struggling with rosacea for years and despite numerous treatment plants she wasn't seeing the Improvement that she hoped for so after discussing her emotional health she ensured that she had been carrying unaddressed Trauma from her early childhood this emotional burden manifests as stress in her daily life which often triggered her rosacea flare-ups and once Jean recognized this connection she sought a therapy to work through her childhood traumas as she began to heal emotionally and let go of the fear and anger issues that she was suppressing she noticed a significant reduction in her rosacea symptoms now this isn't to say that therapy cured her rosacea but rather that addressing her emotional health proved to be a vital part of managing her condition Jane's story underlines why it's essential to address underlying emotions that may be affecting your health professional help such as therapy or counseling can provide safe place and a safe space to explore these emotions and healthy coping strategies moreover incorporating practices like meditation mindfulness yoga breathing exercises journaling or engaging with support groups can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with rosacea many people find such practices can provide a sense of community and understanding further improving your emotional health and your resilience remember nurturing your emotional well-being is a crucial step in taking control of your skin and your overall health your emotional health is just as important as your physical health in managing rosacea I'd love to hear about your own experiences or thoughts in the comments section Below in relation to emotional health I do read them all and reply to as many as I can I hope you're enjoying this content if so please hit the like button and consider subscribing to the channel let's move on to look at lifestyle and other dad refactors starting with sunlight sunlight can make rosacea symptoms worse the UV rays or the ultraviolet rays from the Sun creates substances known as reactive oxygen species in the skin that lead to inflammation or swelling and redness now this inflammation can trigger your immune system in a way that increases certain molecules in your skin that are connected to rosacea also these same sun rays can boost signals in the skin that help blood vessels grow and this might be why people with rosacea often have small widened blood vessels known as talange activities on their skin sunlight can also weaken the structures that support your skin like collagen and elastin this could make rosacea worse by interfering with the natural drainage process in your skin because of these effects it's especially important for people with rosacea to protect their skin from the Sun you may need to trial a variety of sunscreens before you find one that suits you most people find that they need a mineral sunscreen with ingredients like zinc or titanium which reflect the cylinderase and manage rosacea symptoms better there are also some chemical sunscreens which do a good job at reducing the Skin's redness but it's not just UV sunlight though it's also things like cold weather wind and hot weather or indoor heating can also flour rosacea let's discuss alcohol now it's becoming clear that even small amounts of alcohol aren't the best thing that we can do for our Health and Longevity in relation to rosacea research has shown that alcohol worsens the flushing or the redness this study has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of a certain type of rosacea called fimatus rosacea this conclusion was based on a review of multiple studies that compare people who drink alcohol with those who don't interestingly the risks seem to be higher in Maine than in women now anyone interested in their health knows that smoking unvaping for that matter is bad for them this systematic review on meta-analysis AIM to examine the relationship between rosacea and smoking they analyzed 12 studies which included over 50 000 patients with rosacea and 80 000 controls and when they looked at specific subtypes of rosacea they found a few interesting patterns smoking appeared to increase the risk of two specific types of rosacea namely the popular postular rosacea characterized by redness and swelling and acne like decades and like alcohol the famous rosacea and it's characterized by the thickening of the skin and enlargement often resulting in that bulbous shaped nose but interestingly and I'm nearly afraid to tell you this they discovered that current smokers those who were smoking at the time of the study seemed to have a slightly decreased risk of rosacea while ax smokers those who had previously smoked but had quit and they had an increased risk of rosacea now obviously this does not mean that you should smoke two reduce your rosacea exploring the link between diet and rosacea is a topic so fast it could easily fill its own separate video now if you'd like me to delve deeper into that drop a comment below now what rule does Diet play in managing musician according to a survey conducted by the national rosacea Society almost 80 percent of the 400 patients surveyed reported that they had made changes to their diet due to rosacea and all these an impressive 95 percent observed a reduction in flare-ups underscoring the potential influence of dietary habits on their skin condition now to better understand the relationship between diet and rosacea let's turn to this scientific paper that specifically investigated this connection it was found that Foods triggering rosacea can generally be grouped into four categories firstly we have hot foods secondly alcoholic beverages and then thirdly foods containing capsicum like spices and peppers and then foods containing cinnamaldehyde such as Tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate now you might wonder why these Foods well it turns out that they can activate certain channels in skin cells known as transient receptor potential channels when these channels are activated they can increase blood flow to the skin leading to symptoms like redness flushing and a burning sensation however there's an important caveat the impact of diet on rosacea symptoms can vary widely from person to person while some individuals may find certain foods trigger their symptoms others have no effect with it at all and this makes it challenging to come up with a set of dietary guidelines that would apply universally to all rosacea patients but in a minute I'm going to try with my own recommendations anyway some foods have been noodle to potentially have protective effects against certain forms of rosacea for instance omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish walnuts flax seeds may help Safeguard against ocular or eye rosacea I'll share my diary recommendations shortly but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about gut health while more research is certainly needed it's becoming increasingly clear that gut health plays a significant role in rosacea this suggests that strategies targeting gut health could be promising areas for research for rosiation treatment to understand the rule our gut health plays and conditions like rosacea we need to talk about the gut microbiome this is a community of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our digestive tract these tiny organisms play a crucial role in our overall health including digestion creation of vitamins and our mood and our immune system regulation now you may be asking what does my gut have to do with my skin well this is where the concept of the gut skin axis comes in the gut skin axis refers to the relationship between the health of our gut and the health of our skin imbalances in the gut microbiome is a condition known as dysbiosis and dysbiosis can affect our skin in fact Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome between rosacea patients and patients without rosacea prebiotics and probiotics can help prebiotics are compounds that we consume that feed these beneficial bacteria in our gut probiotics on the other hand are beneficial bacteria that we consume often through foods like yogurts and kombucha kimchi sauerkraut are through other dietary supplements now consuming probiotics and prebiotics can potentially help maintain or restore a healthy gut microbiome recent research suggests that probiotics like lactobacillus KSI could have a positive impact for rosacea symptoms for example one Australian study reported a significant Improvement in rosacea symptoms after participants took lactobacillus KSI probiotic supplement over eight weeks it started the probiotics might have helped by targeting an overgrowth of a certain bacteria in the small intestine which is often seen in rosacea patients however it's important to note that while these results are promising more research is needed in fact there's an ongoing clinical trial exploring this exact question so we can look forward to more information on that in the near future as promised here are some dead reconsiderations I recommend to my patients with rosacea firstly keep a food diary and try to identify links with certain foods on your rosacea flourish two avoid processed foods basically anything in a packet 3. avoiding refined sugars and high glycemic foods our Western diet is full of processed foods and highly refined carbohydrates reduce foods with a high glycemic index as these are rapidly digested and absorbed resulting in markedly Wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels now this could potentially lead on doors lead to inflammation which in turn May contribute to the progression of rosacea fourthly consider an Elimination Diet removing foods with cinnamaldehyde like tomatoes citrus fruits cinnamon and chocolate and other foods like spices and peppers for four to eight weeks now some people may also benefit from moving dirty from their dad so this was also worth traveling slowly reintroduce Foods if you want to back into your dad every few days and observe for changes in your skin also try to eat a wide variety of colorful Whole Foods and fibrous carbohydrates basically think vegetables which grow above the ground consider adding a good omega-3 supplement or a Prebiotic or a probiotic supplement I have quite deliberately left the medical management to the last working on your emotional health and take an appropriate lifestyle measures as described earlier is crucial on your journey to Healing eurization now there are quite a few Medical Treatments available for rosacea ranging from topical creams to oral medications and laser therapy most of these require a doctor visit and a prescription but this information may help you and your doctor decide a treatment plan that suits you let's start with the topical treatments patients with rosacea have a dysfunctional Skin Barrier therefore water is lost from the skin and the skin is often sensitive and irritable so any topical preparations that contain moisture and are not irritant can help rebuild the Skin Barrier and for the same reason you should be careful not to exfoliate or use harsh treatments on your skin even talling too hard May flare your rosacea so there's no harm in using anything that doesn't irritate your skin and can moisturize it to moisturize daily before we get into the medical products it's worth mentioning camouflage makeups specific makeups and even sunscreens are made with a green tint that can reduce the redness when applied directly to the skin now you don't have to worry your skin won't be green over the top of the redness it will neutralize and be normal skin tone then let's look at azelic Acid it can help reduce inflammation and redness on the skin it's good for the redness but not so helpful for treating papules or spotty rosacea niacinamide is another useful product in rosacea it is anti-inflammatory properties and improved Skin Barrier function so that's a double Huawei for it next we have Ivermectin now I have some personal experience using Ivermectin or patch of rosacea I had on my forehead for several years it kept flaring and etching especially when I was stressed and it reminded me back to that what I mentioned at the beginning about the warning indicator light on the car when it flirt I would be sure to deal with my stressors and look after myself a bit better because I knew when this went rare that there was something going on however I did eventually get around to doing something about it so I got some Abram Martin and it actually took it away with daily use after about four weeks now that's over a year ago and it hasn't come back since Ivermectin is a medication that is used to kill parasites in the case of rosacea it's believed to work by reducing the number of demo Dax mites in the skin these little parasites which live in most people's skin seem to play a role in causing rosacea when they get out of control Ivermectin is best for postular rosacea and it's usually very well tolerated although some people do get a redness with it metronidazole is another topical prescription treatment it's an antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation and redness but it's common to get a recurrence of symptoms on stopping it next bromonidine which is a visual constructure which means it helps narrow the blood vessels down and when it's applied topically it can help reduce the rareness associated with rosacea it's important to start with a really small amount of it and build it up gradually as some people report a burning and a lot of redness with it good old retinoids may be useful in rosacea to improve collagen and reduce abnormal blood vessel formation but you need to be careful with them retinoids can cause redness even in someone with healthy skin so if you and your doctor decided to use a retinoid please start with a very low dose and go slow with it over time besides topical treatments there's also some oral medications that can help manage rosacea symptoms tetracycles are a class of antibiotics often used to treat rosacea they include doxycycline and lime recycling although that could vary depending on what part of the world you're in they do have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage rosacea symptoms and doxycycline is often used at a low dose like 40 milligrams slow release for rosacea because that exploits as anti-inflammatory properties but doesn't activate its antibacterial effects and that helps avoid antibiotic resistance and it's usually taken once daily alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin may be used if tetracyclines are not tolerated or if there's a reason why you can't use them while antibiotics can help manage rosaceous symptoms they're not a cure and symptoms May recur after the treatment is stopped the risk of bacterial resistance is also of a serious concern especially with a long-term use of antibiotics therefore the low dose or the modified release preparations are commonly used if someone does require the treatment for long-term use in more severe cases of rosacea or cases that don't respond to our earlier treatments isotret known may be considered it's a powerful retinoid medication that's often used to treat severe acne but it can also be effective in treating rosacea it's only prescribed in specialist centers if you have difficulty accessing and appropriately qualified medical professional there are online Dermatology Services who can assess your skin where you upload photographs and describe your symptoms a dermatologist then assesses your individual case and prepares a personalized blend of topical treatments suitable for your condition and your skin type I use dermatica for my own personalized night cream and contains a retinoid and a pigment reducer signing up with them at dermatica.com or demonica.co.uk and entering the code Dr Finbar on checkout means you'll get a 10 discount of any products that you purchase so rosacea can be a challenging condition to manage but by looking out for your emotional health make an appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments you can take control over your skin and enjoy a better quality of life if these methods alone don't get you the desired results have a look on their Monica's websites for personal treatment plans or visit an appropriately trained Healthcare professional don't let rosacea hold you back you deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your skin now if you found this video helpful watch this short video on how we can start start

        "transcript": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition\u00a0\nthat usually affects the face. Its often mistaken\u00a0\u00a0 for acne, eczema, or an even allergic skin\u00a0\nreaction. It causes redness and visible blood\u00a0\u00a0 vessels in your face and sometimes produces\u00a0\nsmall red, pus filled bumps that flare up for\u00a0\u00a0 weeks to months, disappear and reappear when\u00a0\nyou least expect. In this video, im going to\u00a0\u00a0 go over what rosacea is, what causes it, how\u00a0\nto treat rosacea, and 1 very important tip you\u00a0\u00a0 dont want to miss out on when it comes to\u00a0\npreventing it,, so stay tuned till the end.\u00a0 Hi guys, yaseen arsalan, media pharmacist here on\u00a0\nyoutube, this week's video is on rosacea. Smash\u00a0\u00a0 the like button below NOW, as there is a ton\u00a0\nof useful information in here, that I know you\u00a0\u00a0 can benefit from. Also, it helps others find this\u00a0\nvideo as well, iso we can beat rosacea together.\u00a0 Rosacea affects more than 16 million Americans,\u00a0\nwhich is another reason why i wanted to make this\u00a0\u00a0 video. To hopefully point you in the direction\u00a0\nwhen it comes to understanding managing rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 and when to let your doctor know. And although,\u00a0\nthe cause of rosacea is still unknown, experts\u00a0\u00a0 believe that the following factors may contribute:\u00a0\nHot drinks and spicy foods,Red wine, alcoholic\u00a0\u00a0 beverages, Temperature extremes, like going\u00a0\nfrom really cold to really hot or vice versa,\u00a0\u00a0 saunas, sunlight or wind, emotions, and even\u00a0\nvarious cosmetic products. Rosacea is more\u00a0\u00a0 common in females than males, and it usually\u00a0\ndevelops after the age of 30. And there is 4\u00a0\u00a0 types you should know of. You have ocular rosacea,\u00a0\nwhich includes eye redness and irritation and\u00a0\u00a0 swollen eyelids. Papulopustular rosacea, which\u00a0\nincludes flushing, swelling, and breakouts that\u00a0\u00a0 resemble acne. Erythemato-telangi-ectatic\u00a0\nrosacea which includes skin discoloration,\u00a0\u00a0 flushing, and visible blood vessels referred to\u00a0\nas spider veins, which you may have heard of. And\u00a0\u00a0 lastly, phymatous rosacea: which leads to bumpy\u00a0\nskin, often accompanied with an enlargement of the\u00a0\u00a0 nose and spider veins can be present too. Although\u00a0\nNo specific test is used to diagnose rosacea. You\u00a0\u00a0 should let your doctor know of the history of\u00a0\nyour symptoms so they can look at your skin\u00a0\u00a0 and rule out other conditions that\u00a0\ncould exist, such as psoriasis,\u00a0\u00a0 eczema, or lupus as the signs and symptoms may\u00a0\nlook alike. If your symptoms involve your eyes,\u00a0\u00a0 your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist\u00a0\n(ophthalmologist) for further evaluation.\u00a0 Now lets look at some treatment option and what\u00a0\ncan you do. Before I go into home remedies you\u00a0\u00a0 can try out starting today, its best to\u00a0\nlet your doctor know of your condition,\u00a0\u00a0 as they most likely will recommend topical\u00a0\nproducts that reduce redness, and can possibly\u00a0\u00a0 be more advantageous, especially if you haven\u2019t\u00a0\ntried them out before. Brimonidine or (Mirvaso)\u00a0\u00a0 and oxymetazoline or (Rhofade) reduce redness\u00a0\nby constricting blood vessels and you can see\u00a0\u00a0 results within 12 hours after use. The\u00a0\neffect on the blood vessels is temporary,\u00a0\u00a0 so the medication needs to be applied regularly to\u00a0\nmaintain improvements. Other topical products have\u00a0\u00a0 less effect on the redness but help control\u00a0\nthe pimples of mild rosacea.These include\u00a0\u00a0 azelaic acid and metronidazole and take up to\u00a0\n6 weeks to show improvement. Your doctor may\u00a0\u00a0 also prescribe antibiotic such as doxycycline or\u00a0\nOracea for moderate to severe rosacea with bumps\u00a0\u00a0 and pimples. ANd if if your rosacea is severe\u00a0\nand nothing else helps, your doctor may suggest\u00a0\u00a0 isotretinoin which is a powerful oral acne drug\u00a0\nthat also helps clear up acne like lesions of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea or can recommend Laser therapy and other\u00a0\nlight-based therapies to help reduce all that\u00a0\u00a0 redness. Now lets look at what you can do until\u00a0\nthen. There are 5 things you can starting now.\u00a0 #1: Identify and avoid triggers. Pay\u00a0\nattention to what tends to flare you up\u00a0\u00a0 and do your best to avoid them. For some that may\u00a0\nbe avoiding certain foods, hot drinks, alcohol,\u00a0\u00a0 and spicy foods. Eating foods that contain\u00a0\nthe compound cinnamaldehyde, such as cinnamon,\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate, tomatoes, and citrus may be culprits\u00a0\nas well. So pay attention to food triggers.\u00a0 #2 Protect your face. You want to make sure\u00a0\nthat if your exposed to the sun for long\u00a0\u00a0 periods of time, that you Use a broad-spectrum\u00a0\nsunscreen \u2014 which blocks both uv A and uv B\u00a0\u00a0 rays \u2014 with an SPF of 30 or higher. Because\u00a0\nso many sunscreens contain chemicals that can\u00a0\u00a0 be absorbed and cause irritation like octinoxate,\u00a0\noctosalate, or octocrylene you want to avoid these\u00a0\u00a0 chemical sunscreens and opt for a physical one\u00a0\nlike zinc oxide. I left one that i commend in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, so definitely check that out.\u00a0\nAlso on that note, if you live a colder climate:\u00a0\u00a0 try to cover your face in cold weather as this\u00a0\nis known to trigger rosacea as well. #3 Treat\u00a0\u00a0 your skin gently. Don't rub or touch your face\u00a0\nexcessively. Use a nonsoap cleanser and moisturize\u00a0\u00a0 frequently. Avoid products that contain alcohol\u00a0\nor other skin irritants or comedogenic products\u00a0\u00a0 that block the oil and sweat gland openings. I\u00a0\nleft more information on that below too, so check\u00a0\u00a0 that out. #4. clean your eyelids at least once\u00a0\na day if you have blepharitis, otherwise known\u00a0\u00a0 as an eyelid inflammation occurring at the base\u00a0\nof the eyelid. And if youre unsure that you do,\u00a0\u00a0 have your doctor examine your eyelids. Using a\u00a0\nwarm compress loosens the crust and has been shown\u00a0\u00a0 to help tremendously. People who have dandruff\u00a0\nare more likely to develop blepharitis. So Keeping\u00a0\u00a0 the dandruff under control can help reduce the\u00a0\nsymptoms, which can in theory help reduce rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 symptoms as well. #5 Makeup. Some makeup products\u00a0\nand techniques may help reduce the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0 skin redness. Try powder cosmetics with a green\u00a0\ntone and matte finish. I left one as well in the\u00a0\u00a0 description below, that has seemed to help others.\u00a0\nSo check that out too. Does it have to be green?\u00a0\u00a0 Green is opposite of red on the color wheel, so\u00a0\nit's perfect for hiding any redness on your face.\u00a0 Now lets look at one of the most effective ways\u00a0\nto prevent it. Which is stress management. For\u00a0\u00a0 those who experience flare-ups as a result\u00a0\nof stress, stress management is an important\u00a0\u00a0 factor in managing your rosacea symptoms. hile\u00a0\nwe may not always know the cause of our stress,\u00a0\u00a0 we do know what relaxes us. Whether it\u00a0\nis reading a book at the end of the day,\u00a0\u00a0 going for a long walk at lunch hour, or\u00a0\neven calling a loved one just to say hello,\u00a0\u00a0 there are little things that we can choose to\u00a0\ndo each day that will help us better manage our\u00a0\u00a0 emotions and have a positive effect on our skin.\nI hope this video was useful to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 and that I hope you do share this video with\u00a0\nsomeone you know who can benefit from it. I also\u00a0\u00a0 hope that you gain just a little bit more control\u00a0\nover your rosacea flare ups.

        "transcript": "[Music]\nNamaste I'm Dr.Urmila Nischal,\u00a0\u00a0 Consultant Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatologist\u00a0\nat Niirmal Skin and Hair Clinic, Bangalore.\u00a0 Are you experiencing redness of your face\u00a0\noff and on every now and then? Then this is\u00a0\u00a0 for you. Most common causes of redness of the\u00a0\nface is sun allergy or a sunburn. So when you\u00a0\u00a0 are exposed close to sun the UVA as well as UVB\u00a0\nray can give rise to what is called as erythema\u00a0\u00a0 or sunburn. The second thing is rosacea.\u00a0\nSo rosacea is a condition where when you\u00a0\u00a0 are exposed to anything hot or when there are\u00a0\nstrong emotions. When you are angry or when you\u00a0\u00a0 laugh or when you are even exposed to sun there\u00a0\nis redness of the face especially on the cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 and the nose. Third is psoriatic dermatitis.\u00a0\nSo how we get dandruff in the scalp similar\u00a0\u00a0 inflammatory condition happens on the sides of\u00a0\nthe nose and this can extend on the cheeks and\u00a0\u00a0 the upper part of the nose. Sometimes dryness\u00a0\nif it is not addressed can lead to redness of\u00a0\u00a0 the face. So the inflammation is manifested as\u00a0\nredness which we call as erythema. So dryness\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely one of the cause which is often\u00a0\nneglected then what as a dermatologist what we\u00a0\u00a0 commonly come across is topical steroid damage\u00a0\nface. Repeated use of a steroid containing cream\u00a0\u00a0 on your face for a long term can cause redness\u00a0\nof the face. This occurs because of the thinning\u00a0\u00a0 of the skin and the prominence of the blood\u00a0\nvessels which is called as telangectasia. The\u00a0\u00a0 skin becomes super sensitive red and itchy most\u00a0\nof the time the other thing could be allergies.\u00a0\u00a0 So allergies could be airborne. So whatever\u00a0\ncomes through the the air you can develop\u00a0\u00a0 allergies allergies to the particles and these\u00a0\nallergies are commonly seen on the upper eyelid\u00a0\u00a0 the cheeks nose and then gradually they spread to\u00a0\nthe rest of the face. Sometimes the urticaria or\u00a0\u00a0 the hives first start on your face. So this also\u00a0\ncould be a cause of redness on the face. Whatever\u00a0\u00a0 may be the cause it's always better to consult\u00a0\na dermatologist and find the solution for this.",

        "transcript": "I want to show you my party trick ready look at my cheeks not those cheeks these cheeks watch what happens when I just lightly touch my face they turn bright red well there are many different reasons that people's faces can get red but for a lot of people it's embarrassing or they're constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of it or they just want to know why it's happening well there are many reasons that people's faces turn red but I wanted to share with you five of the top ones so that if any of this sounds like you you can take this information to a doctor or dermatologist and get a diagnosis that could help you with facial redness or facial flushing if it's something that's bothering you now facial flushing is very different than overall facial redness and we're going to speak a little bit about both what you just saw me do is create more circulation in my skin this happens naturally to just about everyone if you ever pinch your cheeks you can kind of increase circulation and cause redness but for me that redness is a little bit more extreme and the redness in my face also happens all over my body and it specifically happens if I scratch myself ready I wanna this is my other party trick I want to show you ready watch that I barely raked my nails across my skin but I'm going to get these big red welts for me this is dermatographia some people get dermatographia that actually welts up and is really bad or some people just get a little bit of redness like I do but if you notice that you touch your skin or whenever there's something that scratches or scrapes up against you especially if it happens more when it's cold outside you might actually have dermatographia which is a histamic reaction in the skin histamine is what your body creates when you're actually having an allergic reaction so it's kind of like an inflammatory Hive like reaction in the skin can you see how red that is like no joke and it doesn't hurt me at all now this is also related to circulation there's basically lots of blood vessels all over our skin and all of our body but if those blood vessels are really close to the surface or if they are really really overactive then they sometimes can flush and this often happens when we're embarrassed you probably have had that experience where your face gets a little bit red your cheeks get red when you say something embarrassing or if you think back about a moment with a crush or public speaking or something that kind of makes you cringe well it's totally normal to blush but for some people blushing is taken to the next level this is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema and it's basically this massive flush of redness that takes over people's faces their ears and yes their chest and their neck whenever they get embarrassed or socially anxious and sometimes it happens for no reason if we break down that word idiopathic basically means no cause known craniofacial means the cranium this area and facial this area and erythema aerys means red so it's this unknown cause of facial redness and flushing and unfortunately this is something that can come along with social anxiety specifically if you get embarrassed more often than others and then the flushing and the fact that people see you turn bright red can make it even worse this is something that I actually believe I have some of the doctors and derms that I've worked with have mentioned that they think I have it but because I work with them and they are not my doctors and germs I actually need to go get this diagnosed by a separate Derm but I've actually been having this issue more and more frequently especially post covid it idiopathic craniofacial erythema is idiopathic meaning there is no defined reason for it however it does seem to come alongside social anxieties and especially since the pandemic a lot of people have felt a little bit more socially awkward and for myself especially with certain conversations or certain topics my face just tends to flush like nobody's business you may have even seen it in a reaction video or two but I turned absolutely bright red and it can't be hidden for me it's not painful for some people it is and although the exact cause is unknown there may be psychological or anxiety things that are related to it and if you do have this massive blushing flushing response go see a doctor or dermatologist or even speak to a psychologist because this extreme blushing response is not bad it's not dangerous it's not deadly and it's not transferable just the same way dramatography has not bad dangerous deadly or transferable but they can be aesthetically unpleasing or just psychologically uncomfortable the best treatment for extreme blushing could be some Mental Health Resources also just understanding the way that your body flushes the way that blood circulates towards the face close to the skin and how that shows up as redness in our cheeks or the rest of our face head and neck another reason that your skin may be constantly Red is because of a damaged Skin Barrier I think we've all had that experience where we go a little bit too hard with certain products certain exfoliants maybe a scrub that was a little bit too intense for our skin and unfortunately when switching out too many products at a time or not using products that actually nourish and rebuild our Skin Barrier and overly strip them we can end up with a damaged Skin Barrier if we actually look at a diagram of our skin it has multiple layers the epidermis is five tiny little layers and the dermis is two big thicker layers well on top of the epidermis there's actually something called the acid mantle if you want to think of your skin like a castle the acid mantle is the moat around the castle and the castle walls with all the bricks or whatever they make castles out of are your skin cells well that moat that is a liquid that basically protects the castle is very similar to the acid mantle or the moisture barrier that protects your skin but what happens if we overly clean cleanse our face if we use too many stripping exfoliants or a whole bunch of really scratchy scrubs and we get rid of that acid mantle in our Castle analogy it's like what happens if there's a drought that comes in or somebody pokes a bunch of holes in our moat and completely drains it well the remote isn't going to work very well to keep things out right and that's similar to what happens to our skin and especially when our Skin Barrier is damaged it usually comes along with things like itchiness like flakiness like dryness and yes like redness now you can have oily skin and a damaged Skin Barrier as well but especially if you notice dryness flaking irritation and a whole bunch of redness you may be using too many products that are damaging that Skin Barrier there are conditions like eczema and psoriasis which naturally happen to people they have a large genetic component and these conditions actually cause a damaged Skin Barrier in the skin you need to get these diagnosed and treated by a Durham but sometimes it is something genetic or sometimes it's the products that are being used but overall if you think that your skin is red or flush because you've overdone it with certain products start backing off or using products that are a little bit more more calming and a little bit less irritating for instance less fragrances less colorants and less things that have stripping or denatured alcohol another cause for facial redness that happens more often in women than in men is rosacea we've spoken a lot about rosacea on this channel but it's because rosacea can look so similar to acne see rosacea is basically this redness of the skin it usually is a response to someone's lifestyle choices for example if the weather changes their skin might get super red if they eat spicy food or alcohol their skin might flush and get red and rosacea is a condition that has multiple different levels basically of how it presents on the skin for some people it's just a little bit of red flushing for other people they can actually have papillopustular rosacea it honestly looks like acne but with extensive redness and rosacea doesn't always respond to acne medications the way that actual acne does rosacea can also be ocular meaning around the eyes which can be very painful and very dry and for some people they can actually develop rhinophyma which is basically a very large misshapenose that has tons of overactive spacious or oil glands now you need to get this diagnosed by a germ and sometimes it can be hard because rosacea can look like acne if it has those pustules or again redness and flushing in the face or it could look like lupus lupus has kind of a butterfly rash across the nose and the cheeks and sometimes a lupus flare could look like rosacea this is why it is so important to get diagnosed but rosacea is very common and it is usually more common in women than men and it usually does develop later in life especially if you find that when you eat spicy foods or alcohol your face tends to flush or if you go out in the sun and you didn't stay out long enough to get a burn but with a change of weather or the change of temperature your face just starts to freak out especially if your face is overly dry this could be rosacea and there are many things over the counter that are wonderful for treating it but there are also some really powerful prescriptions that doctors and derms can recommend but a lot of people might look at their skin thinking they have acne and wondering why their skin isn't responding to acne treatment and why it's so freaking red all of the time and it might be because this is rosacea so if course it's not responding to acne treatments and we need to look at rosacea treatments instead and then unfortunately you would think people would know this by now but sunburns will make your face red and some people don't realize when they've gotten sun exposure for example if you go outside to the beach you lay down on the sand and you just chill there for two hours without sunscreen you can probably expect to get a sunburn right yes but did you know that you can actually get a sunburn on cloudy days as well you can also get a sunburn if you're just driving in a car let's say that there was traffic and you spent an extra long time in a sunny vehicle during your commute let's say that you were skiing it's super cold outside but the slopes are nice bright and white and the sun actually hits the snow and reflects onto your face this can also cause a sunburn and for a lot of people they don't realize when they are getting that sun exposure especially if they're not wearing a sunscreen every day SPF is your BFF we know this and yes it is an anti-cancer medication essentially it helps to prevent skin cancer but aesthetically it also prevents premature aging it prevents fine lines and wrinkles it prevents your collagen and elastin and those deep two layers from being degraded now remember there are two different forms of sun rays that actually penetrate through the atmosphere that do damage to our skin UVA rays that go deeper and really degrade the collagen and elastin that cause aging and UVB or the burning rays that actually hit the top of the skin but really cause a lot of damage and create that burning sensation as well as that look it can be really hard to treat a sunburn especially if it's a bad one we actually have an entire video on that where we've shared what you need to do if you've had a major Sunburn and when to go to the ER but one of the best things you can do is prevent it from happening in the first place by using a really good sunscreen this one is actually one of my favorites this is the all-com clinical redness corrector it is expensive but it is worth it this is amazing and if you are trying to prevent a sunburn and prevent that redness yes this will work but also if you're like me and you just have redness or flushing of the skin this actually helps to cover it up because it's slightly tinted this was actually made this is from color science this was actually made by a group of people for those who have rosacea so it was specifically made for people who have this skin condition that causes redness and flushing and as you can see here's my dermatographia let me just show you it is a thick thick and thick formula but look at how well that covers and this not only protects me with an SPF 50 but it also covers this redness so if you are embarrassed and you flush easily or you just want that protection all the time this formula can absolutely do it and a little bit goes a very very long way you should never skimp on your sunscreen but this stuff is amazing and I just want to show you you know let me kind of do this to both of my cheeks I'm going to slap my face evenly on both sides basically to stimulate the circulation I just want to show you how well this sunscreen Works versus the side that didn't have the sunscreen and did you know that slapping facials are actually a thing specifically in the Nordic countries like Sweden there are actually facials where you can pay to get slapped to help with blood flow and circulation so some people pay for that I actually pay to get my face slapped at skin gym in Los Angeles that was lots of fun but look at how well this covers I love it there are also sunscreens that have a slightly green tint green can neutralize redness so if you have constant redness for example rosacea or idiopathic craniofacial erythema this red blushing that you never know when it'll pop up this could be a really great option because this prevents that from showing through all the time or if you have a major sunburn this prevents the next one as well as helps with the current one this is also fragrance free because it's made for people with rosacea it's much more gentle on skin so if you have a damaged Skin Barrier this should help now if you've already got a sunscreen in your routine and you don't feel that you need this one one of my favorites is this holica holica Less on skin this is such a good serum this is a Sika serum and I have been obsessed with this for years now it is K Beauty but it has this really hydrating zika look I'm almost out and it has this beautiful blend of ingredients that actually calms down irritation and yes this is fragrance free it's all about being less on skin and very hydrating so if if you do have a damaged Skin Barrier you're just looking to step away from all of the exfoliants and calm down redness this is something that you can use day or night to help really calm the skin down and rebuild it this has suntella as well as other skin nourishing ingredients and you could use this if you have rosacea as well or if you have this extreme facial blushing or even dermatography as well but it's probably not going to be as effective as something that actually covers that now if you have rosacea again this could work very well because it's nice and hydrating and it calms down redness but one of the best things you can do especially if you have redness from rosacea or redness from acne or redness from acne and rosacea is using something that targets it rosacea tends to respond really well to azoleic acid there are prescription strength azelic acids or ones that you can get over the counter this is from Paula's Choice this is my little green leprechaun I love this for rosacea as well as for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding and has acne because it works for both this is a 10 azelic acid booster you can use it on its own or with other products layered but Paula's Choice did it right and 10 is something can get over the counter if you wanted to get prescription you could get like 20 but if you've really been struggling with your skin and you're on the waitlist to see a Durham or you haven't been able to see a germ yet this is something you could pick up and use over the counter now again you still want to get it diagnosed because you want to make sure that it is rosacea and it's not lupus or a staph infection or acne or something else but for a lot of people who don't respond well to acne treatments and they have this redness as well as some of these popular pustule lesions they find that azelic acid works really well and then when they do get that appointment with the Derm the Derm says hey looks like you have rosacea no wonder something like azelic acid helped again this one is great there's one from the ordinary there's a ton of brands that have great azelic acid products this just happens to be one of my favorites that I always go to but this is wonderful for facial redness if that redness is caused by something like rosacea facial redness isn't something to be embarrassed about and especially if you have an anxiety disorder and you're blushing extensively I know that's really hard to hear because it's like you're gonna tell tell me that my extreme facial blushing isn't a problem and then I'm gonna blush when I'm embarrassed and then it's going to be even more obvious and it's going to make it even worse trust me as someone with an anxiety-ridden brain currently I understand but the truth is that we're often perceiving ourselves and judging ourselves more than other people and a lot of other people are so hyper concerned about themselves they're not looking at you or your skin if you're making eye contact if you're speaking confidently and especially if you're saying interesting things they're not sitting there looking at your skin or worrying about what tone or color your face is if it is something you're concerned about there are definitely different things that you can use or different experts like doctors and derms or even psychologists that you can see again there are many reasons for facial redness including other ones that we did not discuss but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the five main ones and the fact that so many people including myself go through some of these things and again it's not something that we should judge ourselves for it's something that we can understand and the more we understand it the less scary it becomes the more we understand it and the less scary it becomes the more open we are to doing something about it if we so choose to also I've tagged all of my favorites right here for facial redness and you can click that little view products button if you want to see some of my favorites and you can actually click the little square there if you want to save them to a list to look at later but if I've missed any of your favorite products that helped you control facial redness please put them in the comments below so that I can look into them or if there's one that you want me to buy and try so you don't have to please leave it in a comment so that I can

well as when you need to call the hospital when you need to go to the ER versus when you can do something about it at home so do always remember to stay hydrated both orally and topically this is a wonderful anti-redness hydrating serum always remember to reapply your SPF again I love this one and always remember to be beautiful both inside and out I love you and I can't wait to see you in this

        "transcript": "so first things first I would refer you to a dermatologist that is for two reasons one they are going to be able to make an accurate diagnosis you need to ensure that you actually have rosacea before you try to treat it an esthetician for example is not capable of making that call they are not qualified the second piece is that you would need to ensure that you have access to a physician in order to gain access to most of the effective treatments for rosacea particularly the ones that become useful in the acute stages when it's really flaring it's not been well controlled those are going to require prescriptions see we need to have a physician on hand anyway but assuming you've done that you've gotten your diagnosis you might have your treatments with respect to your skin care your cleansers your moisturizers your sunscreens minimize irritation wherever possible limiting fragrance we're not using things like drying alcohols we're not using stripping toners we're not using irritating actives like Alpha hydroxy acids that don't directly benefit the rosacea process all those things need to be avoided at least until the rosacea is well controlled with the other treatments and you have the go ahead from your position",

        "transcript": "hello everybody so what you can do while you are so social distancing yourself self quarantine my Asylum just make a video so today is my first video I want to talk about rosacea or rosacea procedure how did get rid of rosacea naturally though I will be sharing some tips that I have been through that works for me because I was struggling with recession for about two years and as you can see now my face got a much clearer I don't want to remind everybody that rosacea is not something that you can cure you can only control it or keep it at bay not having it flare-up in your skin it's not something that you can cure unfortunately so number one you gotta find out what is your root cause of your rosacea so for me only happened once I've changed one of the item of my skincare routine and that was the product that triggered it but when I also go through the whole healing process I realized it was much more than just what I use in my face you know it's always it's also how I treat on my face or skincare the team before how was how I was just randomly picked something for my face without having to care about whether my face get tolerated and then the second thing which is the most important thing is you know stress what I do how did I find out I keep a very close monitor of what I was doing and eating or using every single day and until I nailed it down to stress that you know I found out it's stress that caused the pimples in my face so tips number two you gotta be patient with your own station with skin it takes time to heal so when I got diagnosed with rosacea before I had beautiful skin and I really had a struggle in dealing with or coming to the fact that you know I had no seizure before my skin was flawless and then now my skin got like bumps on the face and people saying something about my face it said something that I done and you know it was red it was bumpy the texture was rough so it was um it was a hit on my confidence you gotta really accept the fact that rosacea is not gonna go away like overnight it's not like a cold where you can take some medicine and then you'll be fine in five days it's not something like that unless it's a really mild but that's not the case for me you know I had been tackling Liat for the past two years and now you know I can find I've managed to control my rosacea I've managed to get rid of my rosacea okay number three so what kind of treatments you can get for rosacea so I've gone through a lot of treatments for me and it seems that nothing works for me now when you go to see a doctor you know they will get you diagnosed and what I was prescribed with some antibiotics for about two months two months antibiotics I think it won't really even subscribe to me he even gave me a few months of antibiotics so also the Chinese medicine the doctor would give me some cream to put on to calm down the skin the pimples I used all of them and I also did some laser treatment who make the redness go away you know I did all of them you know don't get me wrong I did all of them and it didn't work for me at all and at one point I was just so frustrated that I just stopped using everything so so how did I get rid of mobilization naturally again you know I'm gonna go back to point one once I found out what my root causes which is stress and also things that I use I really focus on it so what I did I did all things to de-stress and and I start looking into you know what cost distress in my life and it hoping like a pintar box a box of worm which I find out you know I was actually stressing myself quite a lot and at the same time when I was diagnosed with rosacea also got digestion problem so all of this is the sign of my body telling me that you know my body can't take it anymore I started stressing out every single day every time something comes up so that was my treatment really I know it sounds a bit not helpful but that was that path I got down to you know I was I was having having all these kind of treatments and at one point I've got some laser for the face to to calm down the redness on my face and after two weeks it all comes back you know my people starts to come back and everything so at the end I I really actually you know use how to de-stress meditation I was searching myself going inward to really get down to you know what where the stress is coming from and then the second thing in K so as I mentioned earlier I wasn't present - what kind of skincare was using not that was not taking care of my skin I was a skincare junkie you know I all kind of stuff because I was I was interested I was curious so when I realized I was using our system depicting stuff based on what I think would be good for my skin instead of what is that actually good for my skin so I towel down my skin community into something more natural something on my own and I still stick to it today because I see I see that you know it works for my skin so so you gotta find out you know what would be beneficial for your skin so hopefully you find this tips useful I really hope that everyone can get rid of the rosacea at the end without much effort and hassle again you know you gonna reflect what caused your rosacea so that you can get rid of it get rid of your rosacea and if you have any question for me you can ask me you know what did I use and all that so I'll be sharing what kind of skincare treatment or routine I use in my next video so if you like this video give this video a thumbs up if you want to can also subscribe to my channel this is my first video so stay safe in this situation this coronavirus and I'll speak to you again in the next video bye bye",

        "published_at": "2021-06-23T13:00:10Z",
        "transcript": "so many of you have been requesting videos on rosacea especially since i talked about it being a skin condition that i personally struggle with so i thought a good place to start is to tell you a little bit about what rosacea is and some do's and don'ts to follow if you have rosacea i'm dr sam ellis and i'm a board-certified dermatologist i'm here to help you understand your skin and find skincare products that work for you first of all what is rosacea rosacea is a chronic but treatable skin condition that typically involves the face now i say treatable and not curable because sometimes patients will come see me in my office expect to get a treatment regimen for three to four months for their rosacea and then never deal with it again and the reality is that rosacea is a lifelong condition and there will be times when it's flaring and there will be times when it's under really good control but the goals of rosacea management aren't to get rid of it because there's no cure but to manage it in a way where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life and where you're happy with your skin it's a persistent inflammatory skin condition meaning that it often presents with redness and irritation and i'll talk a little bit more about the signs and symptoms of rosacea in a minute but it also affects men and women the women slightly more than men and it is really a disease of adults so the onset of rosacea is usually after the age of 30. more than 16 million americans have rosacea that's about 1 in 20 people and we think that globally about 5.5 percent of the world's population also has rosacea rosacea symptoms can include easily flushing or blushing persistent facial redness visible vessels on the skin surface easily irritated skin scaly skin dry skin itchy skin it also can affect the eyes so some people will get grittiness or irritation in their eyes and the last thing is that rosacea can have pimples and so it is often misdiagnosed as acne someone with rosacea might just have one or two of those symptoms and someone might have all of the things i just listed so it really can exist on a spectrum of severity but also the presentation can vary widely from person to person one question i get all the time is why do i have rosacea what is causing it is it something that i am doing and oftentimes it's not it we know that rosacea is caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors but a lot of times people don't have full control over those and so it's not about what's causing your rosacea at that point it's more about you have rosacea what are we going to do about it and it's great that we have awesome treatments to help get rosacea under control for people and manage those signs and symptoms so they're not suffering from their skin condition on a day-to-day basis prior to just a few years ago we used to categorize people with rosacea based on kind of the main signs or symptoms that they were presenting with i'm gonna go over those four categorizations even though we don't really use those clinically anymore because i do think it helps people understand the signs and symptoms that rosacea can present with but just know we don't use those categorizations anymore because we understand that people with rosacea can kind of have overlapping symptoms that span more than one category the first of sort of these four categories of rosacea is something called erythematolangictatic rosacea and really what this means is rosacea presenting with facial redness and typically this is redness in the center of the face so the chin the cheeks the nose and the forehead and this is redness that is often present at baseline but then gets worse with flushing or blushing based on exposure to certain triggers and then with that flushing or blushing you can also have altered sensations of the skin like sensitivity stinging burning or sort of this overwhelming heat sensation the other thing that can happen with this erythematologic rosacea is the presence of telangiectasias which are dilated blood vessels that are visible on the skin surface the second prior subtype of rosacea was something called papulopustular rosacea and really this was rosacea presenting with red bumps or red pustules which are red bumps filled with pus this is the type of rosacea or a feature of rosacea that is most commonly mistaken or mistreated as acne so it's something that's important for your doctor to be able to recognize the third prior categorization of rosacea was something called thymidus rosacea also called rhinophyma when it specifically involved the nose but really this is the development of sort of a thick bumpy texture to the skin and it's not a common feature of rosacea but it's certainly something to keep an eye out for the fourth category of rosacea was ocular rosacea or rosacea involving the eye this will often present as irritation light sensitivity watering eyes a gritty sensation in the eye but like i said before we are not using these four categorizations anymore we know that people can have redness and eye symptoms or feminist features and papules and pustules so it's more about what each unique person is presenting with when we're diagnosing and treating their rosacea so let's get into the do's and don'ts of rosacea i just want to put a caveat here though that these are guidelines they are not strict rules i know i'm a physician i'm a board certified dermatologist and i'm telling you these things about rosacea but just know that everyone's skin is different and if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is fine it's no big deal but these might be things that are worth thinking about if your rosacea is not under optimal control and you're trying to figure out ways for you to intervene and make a meaningful positive difference see a dermatologist we are able to accurately diagnose and give you a treatment plan for your rosacea i cannot tell you how many times i've seen rosacea misdiagnosed as acne lupus an allergic reaction eczema seborrheic dermatitis if your face is red or bumpy or sensitive and you don't know why get the help of an expert to make sure you're treating the right thing get to know your rosacea triggers and then avoid those triggers so although we don't know all of the causes of rosacea we do know certain environmental factors make rosacea worse and they can really vary from person to person so things like sun exposure hot or cold weather stress alcohol chocolate dairy spicy foods i mean the list goes on and it really is unique to each person what i recommend is that if you're not sure what your triggers are keep a rosacea diary any time your rosacea is flaring write down what you ate what you drink and what your surrounding environment is like being more aware of your triggers and avoiding them will absolutely help your rosacea stay under better control protect your skin from the sun so wide brim hats please and then sunscreen every single day now i used to tell my rosacea patients to use mineral-based sunscreens only so those with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as the uv filters because we thought they were maybe a little bit less irritating but what i found over time is that a lot of my rosacea patients can tolerate chemical uv filters in their sunscreen just fine so rather than limiting my patients sunscreen options i let them know that it might be a little bit of trial and error to find a sunscreen that they love but once they do use it every day keep your skin well moisturized people with rosacea often will have some skin barrier disruption and be more prone to barrier disruption even if they're using gentle skin care so using a nice moisturizer that feels good on your skin that doesn't cause stinging every single day and maybe sometimes twice a day if you're feeling particularly dry will help your skin feel better and look better too and my final do is have realistic expectations of what's achievable when treating rosacea typically the goals should be to have fewer flares and have your symptoms be well managed but if your goal is to have zero evidence that you've ever had rosacea you're really likely to be disappointed and i'm not saying that to be debbie downer dermatologist over here but if you focus on incremental improvement you're much more likely to find success in your treatment and be happier for it let's get into the don'ts i feel like i have to say this one more time before i get into the don'ts which is if i tell you not to do something and you've been doing it and your rosacea is totally fine that's okay keep doing it these are not rosacea laws these are just recommendations don't overheat your skin or expose it to extreme temperatures now this can be tricky to do all of the time but we do know that really cold weather and wind as well as really hot weather and indoor heating can all flare rosacea don't rub or scrub the face so any type of physical manipulation or physical exfoliation can cause increased redness and irritation so that goes for physical exfoliants like microbeads or scrubs as well as even like the rough fibers of a towel rubbed on the face they can all cause increased irritation so pat your face dry don't aggressively massage it just be nice to your skin don't use too many products a simple skincare regimen really is best especially if you're incorporating prescription topical medications to treat your rosacea you really don't want to be layering product after product after product you also might be sensitive to certain products so doing a little patch test in front of your ear or on your jawline for several days before kind of using it all over your entire face is not a bad idea don't use certain skin care ingredients that are known to trigger rosacea not every person with rosacea is going to be sensitive to the same types of skincare ingredients but in a survey conducted by the national rosacea society there were some ingredients that more people tended to be sensitive to and those are things like alcohol witch hazel fragrance menthol peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil there are other types of skin care ingredients like tretinoin and retinoids salicylic acid glycolic acid benzoyl peroxide antioxidants and topical vitamin c and people want to know i have rosacea those things can be irritating can i use them and really it's on a case-by-case basis one thing i recommend is never introducing more than one active to your regimen at once so if you're thinking okay i want to introduce a retinoid go low and slow and kind of see how it works out for you i use tretinoin in my routine even though i have rosacea but i could not do that initially i had to get my rosacea under really good control before i could incorporate that ingredient i never want to say anything is truly off limits for my rosacea patients but just know that you have to use things like acids or exfoliators with caution and understand that even if you can't tolerate them at this point in your rosacea journey you might be able to in the future don't be afraid to use prescription medication i find that sometimes in clinic i meet resistance from patients who just want to use over-the-counter options but this is a true skin disease and i don't find that most of my patients want over-the-counter options for their other types of diseases that they have skin disease should be no different don't be afraid of the prescriptions they are really developed for the treatment of rosacea they have been well studied give them a shot and my final don't is if you have rosacea and you have not been able to get it under control don't feel hopeless okay team up with a dermatologist maybe get a second opinion and also understand that rosacea is constantly being researched we are learning more about this condition day by day and as we move forward we are going to have even better treatments and interventions to offer what tips have helped you with your rosacea put them in the comments below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and i'll see

        "transcript": "so now moving on to solutions and treatments for rosacea so rosacea is a condition which can run in their families so people who have rosacea i haven't seen it i can see that so first thing first you need to cut out everything that is hot whether it is temperature hot or hot spices anything that causes flushing is what you stop for example in your alcohol i wouldn't like you to take a brandy or a whiskey or a red wine which causes flushing so you take alcohol which doesn't cause flushing in your diet you don't use too much of green chili and red chili or peppers which just spike your skin and then make it become too red so you also in the food substances cut off the inflammatory food like sugar so these then in the diet format itself gives you a lot of relief because this is a condition which is ongoing right so you need something even in the diet to kind of help you you need to make lifestyle changes exactly and the temperature itself wherein you end up not having too hot a coffee or tea even if you want to have something hot don't let the steam just come up on your face like have a sip and put it away i see a lot of people discussing with the cup like this where they've had and it's it's like this where the steam kind of keeps coming on so you put that away especially if you have rosacea yeah and then when you do the gym you don't end up going in the steam room because that again on the face causes you know flushing so if you have to go to a steam room after the gym use a cold tub on the face and when you wash your hair don't use too hot water to wash your hair so these are a few lifestyle changes that might really really help you other than that there is enough studies showing now it is not the same thing that causes acne is what causes acne rosacea is what we thought right but it is not the same pathogen what we know now that it is a mite which causes it called demodex so the treatment for rosacea acne is not necessarily the treatment for acne so there is ivormectin which has given fantastic results when we apply there is something called azilic acid which gives you a fantastic result in terms of cutting down the redness and the acne that happens so these are applications of course which your dermatologist may have to give you uh but you need to know as a knowledge that this is what's the latest what's happening in science right and so the treatment for rosacea would be topical or would you need a procedure like with creams and stuff or procedure maybe not right away but two things you'll always need some topical depending on the stage of rosacea you may not or you may also need oral medication so topicals like i said more of acetic acid ivermectin metro metronidazole these were the things that we were using as topicals depending on what your your your stage is and how bad or good your rosacea is the doctor might choose what you get what's important also is for you to hydrate your skin so that the skin's barrier function is kept intact so you should look for ingredients like ceramides in your skin care cream calming ingredients maybe like a calamine so these are things that will help you to apply",

        "transcript": "shining toxin in erythema and flushing of rosacea is really a hot topic and has been for a few years now first of all if we think about how toxin is postulated to act in this situation it's actually not through the acetylcholine pathway which is the way that toxin is used cosmetically it's through the cgrp calcitonin gene related peptide pathway which is very interesting and we're starting now to get some controlled studies for instance i quote in my lecture one study by kim and colleagues which was published in dermatologic surgery last year where there was randomization of one cheek of each patient to toxin and the other treat to saline now why is this important because we know that needling of the skin simply injecting with the needle into the skin can have some effects on cytokine cascades and inflammation so in this way we are controlling for needling and this controlled study showed a significant improvement in the clinical erythema assessment and the global aesthetic improvement scores for patients with rosacea when treated with toxin there are other anecdotal case reports which predate this study in the literature and they quite often show quite dramatic results visually my take home messages for anyone thinking of using botulinum toxin for patients with rosacea is that this is an intradermal injection i showed a little video in my lecture for aedvmx to illustrate that these are small doses 0.5 to 1 of botulinum toxin per point i would multiply by two point five for my doses of botulinum toxin 10 to 15 units per cheek and i don't go beyond a maximum total facial dose of 80 to 100 units most often i'm around 50 to 60 or 70 units that suffices this treatment toxin can be useful for refractory patients suffering from rosacea that is when other treatments have failed or as an adjunct or an addition to other therapies i will caution again about evidence gaps we need more controlled studies we also need to think about the cost versus benefit analysis because typically this treatment will not be covered by a patient's insurance they'll be paying out of pocket and so we must be sure that we are selecting patients for this treatment who are truly going to get a benefit that justifies the cost that they will incur",

journey i'm going to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0 skin condition which i have been suffering from\u00a0\nlast 15 years which is called rojasia i'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to divide this video into different categories\u00a0\nand i'll put that timeline on this video here if\u00a0\u00a0 you are not interested in one part you can move on\u00a0\nto next this is the best my skin has been in the\u00a0\u00a0 last 15 years i'm actually not wearing any makeup\u00a0\nthis is my skin i've moisturized my face i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually only got eye makeup also i'm going to put\u00a0\nup lots of pictures pose a video of my skin also i\u00a0\u00a0 want to say here if anybody's suffering from skin\u00a0\nproblem i would like to say that i understand you\u00a0\u00a0 where you are coming from it must be really hard\u00a0\nfor you i myself have experienced this firsthand\u00a0\u00a0 so i hope this video will give you positive things\u00a0\nto take away so let's talk about what is rosacea\u00a0\u00a0 fast rosacea is a long-term skin condition which\u00a0\nmostly affects women it specifically affects the\u00a0\u00a0 face like cheeks and nose chin there is also like\u00a0\nredness acne soiling dilated blood vessels most\u00a0\u00a0 of the time it could be down to family history\u00a0\nlike heredity and other factors could include\u00a0\u00a0 like food also cold weather heat as well and\u00a0\nthen menopause as well stress as well it is\u00a0\u00a0 not curable there are some topical creams you\u00a0\ncan get that will work for a short term you\u00a0\u00a0 can also do like a laser treatment it will help to\u00a0\nreduce rosacea to some extent there are different\u00a0\u00a0 types of resistance there is four types the one\u00a0\ni was diagnosed with was vascular rosacea it was\u00a0\u00a0 redness at fast when it started let's talk about\u00a0\nmy skin prior to suffering from rosacea i used to\u00a0\u00a0 have a very oily skin never really suffered\u00a0\nfrom any acne problem before or any sort of\u00a0\u00a0 skin problem the only time i had acne was when i\u00a0\nwas teenager and it came around here like on my\u00a0\u00a0 eyebrows i used to have pretty good skin however\u00a0\nthat change after i came to the uk there are two\u00a0\u00a0 factors i believe contributed towards my rhodesia\u00a0\none is the weather because the weather here is so\u00a0\u00a0 cold i came from part of nepal where it used to be\u00a0\nlike a very mild winter the harsh winter actually\u00a0\u00a0 made my skin drier and drier and then my skincare\u00a0\nroutine also made it more drier because i was\u00a0\u00a0 using oil-free products steaming we use radiator\u00a0\nduring winter time so it's quite warm so that can\u00a0\u00a0 affect your skin as well and it did affect my\u00a0\nskin i started to get redness first on my chin\u00a0\u00a0 here and then it moved on to my cheeks and then on\u00a0\nmy nose i had no idea what was making it like that\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness at first but still people were able\u00a0\nto notice my face so everybody started asking like\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on with my face what's wrong with my\u00a0\nface people would notice because face is the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing people see i thought this redness would\u00a0\ngo away over the time but it didn't and then i\u00a0\u00a0 decided to go and see gp the gp straight away said\u00a0\nto me it was vascular vascularization i had never\u00a0\u00a0 heard of rosacea actually the gp didn't mention\u00a0\na lot about rosacea i kind of like got lifted\u00a0\u00a0 which explained what it is not much information\u00a0\nwas given to me and i honestly felt lost at that\u00a0\u00a0 time i was told like there was no cure at all it\u00a0\ncan go just like how it came either i would suffer\u00a0\u00a0 like for a long time that was like really shocking\u00a0\nthing for me let's talk about the timeline of\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea how it was at first and then how it became\u00a0\nworse when it started it was like i said earlier\u00a0\u00a0 mild redness and then it actually became more\u00a0\naggressive it was very red it would always start\u00a0\u00a0 from my chin and i knew like it's gonna move on to\u00a0\nmy nose and then it's gonna move on to my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0 i couldn't stop it and that was like the most\u00a0\nfrustrating part the only part that was clear\u00a0\u00a0 was my forehead it was like that on and off and\u00a0\nsometimes it would go away for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 again it will come back when i decided to come\u00a0\nback on youtube guess what happened my skin became\u00a0\u00a0 worse i was putting makeup because i had to look\u00a0\npresentable makeup is kind of like a worst enemy\u00a0\u00a0 for rosacea and it just made it worse my skin was\u00a0\nall flaky it was that bad however whenever it went\u00a0\u00a0 away i would have no scarring at all my face was\u00a0\nso clear that nobody can tell i was suffering from\u00a0\u00a0 rosacea people are so quick to jump on conclusion\u00a0\nand judge like saying oh it must be makeup you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't washed your face properly there are so\u00a0\nmany factors that goes behind skin breakout not\u00a0\u00a0 just makeup or not washing face properly some\u00a0\npeople even said to me like it could be skin\u00a0\u00a0 cancer they were trying to be doctor basically it\u00a0\ncould have actually mentally affected me i didn't\u00a0\u00a0 think too much about my face even though people\u00a0\nwere making big deal out of it most of the time i\u00a0\u00a0 would go out without makeup that is how confident\u00a0\ni was however i was not confident sharing this\u00a0\u00a0 on social media because i really didn't want\u00a0\nother people to judge behind the keyboard social\u00a0\u00a0 media can be sometimes very nasty place the only\u00a0\nreason i didn't share this on my social media was\u00a0\u00a0 because i didn't want this to affect my mental\u00a0\nhealth so what i used to do was whenever i had\u00a0\u00a0 like a very bad breakout i would actually use like\u00a0\nface tune smooth out my face get rid of acne so\u00a0\u00a0 nobody could tell like i was suffering from a skin\u00a0\ncondition the reason i did that was to protect my\u00a0\u00a0 mental health well-being basically i reached\u00a0\nto the point that i would be scared to even\u00a0\u00a0 put moisturizer because i feel like it will make\u00a0\nmy skin red and none of the moisturizers actually\u00a0\u00a0 help with my flakiness my skin was literally\u00a0\npeeling off i didn't know what to do at this\u00a0\u00a0 point i went to see gp various time the only thing\u00a0\nthey did for me was give me topical creams i have\u00a0\u00a0 actually used every topical cream that exists for\u00a0\nrosacea it will work for 2-3 months afterwards it\u00a0\u00a0 would stop working completely my skin became very\u00a0\nresistant against this topical cream so whenever\u00a0\u00a0 that happened they would prescribe me another new\u00a0\none that would work for a bit it will clear up my\u00a0\u00a0 skin like i had nothing before and again in few\u00a0\nmonths it would come back so it was on and off i\u00a0\u00a0 got so tired of it i got fed up i wanted to see\u00a0\nlike a private dermatologist but unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 where i lived there were no private dermatologist\u00a0\nat that time hence i didn't go down the private\u00a0\u00a0 route at the end i asked my gp to recommend me\u00a0\nto dermatologists which actually took four to\u00a0\u00a0 five months of weight and by the time i went to\u00a0\nsee dermatologists every time my skin would be\u00a0\u00a0 clear i had to actually show them my pictures\u00a0\nbut they would just give me topical cream i saw\u00a0\u00a0 nhs dermatologist four times the last time i saw\u00a0\nthem was in 2016 that time luckily when i went for\u00a0\u00a0 my appointment my skin had a really bad breakout\u00a0\nwhich is exactly what i wanted i was again given\u00a0\u00a0 topical cream if it doesn't go away within like\u00a0\nthree months then they would give me accutine\u00a0\u00a0 which is used as a treatment for severe acne they\u00a0\ntold me that i don't have to do the laser because\u00a0\u00a0 i had acne on top of my redness also another thing\u00a0\ni want to add here is gp and the dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0 never follow up i forgot to talk about the\u00a0\ndermatologist i went to see in nepal i went to\u00a0\u00a0 nepal in 2015 for holiday that time i decided to\u00a0\ngo and see one of the top dermatologists i went to\u00a0\u00a0 his private clinic which was quite expensive he\u00a0\ndiagnosed rosacea correctly he actually gave me\u00a0\u00a0 some ointment again i had to mix like three types\u00a0\nof ointment together and apply that on my face i\u00a0\u00a0 was also given tablets i had no idea what tablets\u00a0\nwere i didn't even ask because i was so desperate\u00a0\u00a0 to get my face clear within three weeks my skin\u00a0\nclear up came back to the uk and i was taking\u00a0\u00a0 these tablets continuously and my hubby checked\u00a0\nthose tablets he said to me this is antibiotics\u00a0\u00a0 i was taking tablets twice a day i was having\u00a0\nthat for almost three months i think it's the\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics that actually cleared my skin rather\u00a0\nthan the topical cream antibiotics kills your good\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria as well as bad bacteria so it just resets\u00a0\nthe whole system of your body if we take it for a\u00a0\u00a0 long period of time that is not good for the body\u00a0\ni stopped immediately as soon as i stopped it got\u00a0\u00a0 worse i decided to take matter on my own hands\u00a0\nand clear my skin i actually started doing a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of research at this point i was so desperate i\u00a0\nwas trying every product and i actually spent\u00a0\u00a0 100 quid on this facial oil which was really hyped\u00a0\nat that time however that broke me out really bad\u00a0\u00a0 i was spending a lot of money but not getting much\u00a0\nout of the product it was making my skin worse and\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i was trying too many products\u00a0\ni thought the korean brands would be gentle on\u00a0\u00a0 my skin so i started investing in korean skincare\u00a0\nbrands but none of them work for me unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 i tried double cleansing i had a dry skin so i\u00a0\nmade it even more drier so i decided to simplify\u00a0\u00a0 my skincare i had one cleanser one exfoliator\u00a0\nand then i had one mask homemade one and then one\u00a0\u00a0 moisturizer that is the only four products i chose\u00a0\ni stopped double cleansing i stopped using korean\u00a0\u00a0 products because i couldn't read ingredients\u00a0\nwhat's in there and i try my best not to go to\u00a0\u00a0 products that have alcohol as well as fragrance\u00a0\nin it then i started this journey of trying to\u00a0\u00a0 calm my skin down and clear my skin basically so\u00a0\nlet's talk about what products i exactly use i was\u00a0\u00a0 using polish which is one percent bha bha works\u00a0\non the top layer of your skin removes all the dead\u00a0\u00a0 cells i was using scrub prior to that scrub has\u00a0\ngot this little granules which made my skin really\u00a0\u00a0 worse because i had acne as well and redness it\u00a0\njust aggravated it more made it more sensitive\u00a0\u00a0 so i completely avoided scrubs and just went for\u00a0\nchemical exfoliation this product actually i found\u00a0\u00a0 through youtube video i'm gonna list all those\u00a0\npeople whose video helped me to clear my skin\u00a0\u00a0 down below on description box polar choices one\u00a0\nhas no fragrance no essential oil and it has got\u00a0\u00a0 green tree extract which minimizes irritation from\u00a0\nacid then i started using only one homemade mask\u00a0\u00a0 stop using sheet masks cause they had a lot of\u00a0\nfragrance i could feel like some of the sheet\u00a0\u00a0 marks were breaking me out making my redness\u00a0\nacne worse i started using yogurt and green\u00a0\u00a0 tea together yogurt has zinc and it dissolves dead\u00a0\nskin cells as well as it works as an estrogen and\u00a0\u00a0 it helps with the breakout also another thing i\u00a0\nfound personally when i applied yogurt on my face\u00a0\u00a0 was that i felt my face very moisturized 20 has\u00a0\na lot of antioxidants it reduces inflammation i\u00a0\u00a0 used to put them on for 30 minutes and let it dry\u00a0\nwash my face off that is what i did another one\u00a0\u00a0 i used was a moisturizer and this one is from\u00a0\nla roche posie it is called sica plus this is\u00a0\u00a0 a heavy duty moisturizer and exactly what i\u00a0\nneeded i was flaking a lot during that time\u00a0\u00a0 this one you can use on sunburn insect bites you\u00a0\ncan use this on kids if you have skin irritation\u00a0\u00a0 after say chemical peels or after any sort of\u00a0\ntreatment then you can apply this these are the\u00a0\u00a0 three products that are my holy grail and i can't\u00a0\nlive without them also another thing i want to say\u00a0\u00a0 is like food is also very important when it came\u00a0\nto me i realized like caffeine and alcohol chili\u00a0\u00a0 like really hot food would affect me and i'll talk\u00a0\nin more depth about do and don'ts of rosacea on\u00a0\u00a0 my next video also i want to say at this point\u00a0\nis that you know my skin didn't clear up just\u00a0\u00a0 overnight like that it took a long time to clear\u00a0\nit took me about a month for all of these three\u00a0\u00a0 products that i was applying to work i think\u00a0\nit was around three weeks i started seeing some\u00a0\u00a0 progress gradually my skin was becoming clear when\u00a0\nwe buy products we tend to think like it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0 work overnight gonna have like a great skin but it\u00a0\ndoesn't work that way it can take up to one month\u00a0\u00a0 for the product to work for your skin so you have\u00a0\nto be very patient for me to have a clear skin\u00a0\u00a0 took me about three months so that is how long it\u00a0\ncan take sometimes it can take four to five months\u00a0\u00a0 it is a long process but you will get there lastly\u00a0\nbefore i go i want to say please be kind to others\u00a0\u00a0 be considerate to people who are suffering from\u00a0\nskin condition before you ask someone about their\u00a0\u00a0 face please think how you would feel if you were\u00a0\nin their shoes i feel like social media is also\u00a0\u00a0 to blame so we are conditioned to think everybody\u00a0\nneeds to have a beautiful skin you always see\u00a0\u00a0 like edited pictures flawless skin clear skin\u00a0\nin real life we have pores we have breakouts\u00a0\u00a0 we have pigmentation nobody has that porcelain\u00a0\nskin or baby like skin still today even though\u00a0\u00a0 i have a clear skin i don't have like a perfect\u00a0\nskin i feel like it is so important to normalize\u00a0\u00a0 skin conditions we need to have open dialogue\u00a0\nand open conversation in social media that is\u00a0\u00a0 how i feel anybody suffering with skin\u00a0\ncondition acne pigmentation or any sort\u00a0\u00a0 of skin condition please be kind to yourself\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching this video once\u00a0\u00a0 again and i hope you found this video helpful\u00a0\nand i'll see you guys on my next video if you\u00a0\u00a0 haven't subscribed please do i love to have\u00a0\nyou on my channel till then take care bye guys",

actually a color correcting treatment it's green as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored [Music] hi welcome back to my channel I'm Dr Joyce Park board certified dermatologist and today we're going to talk about rosacea what is it who gets it why do we get it and I'm going to build a full AM and PM rosacea friendly skincare routine for you now this is a topic that's really personal for me because I have suffered from rosacea for a long time and so has my dad actually and he never saw a dermatologist in all his years of suffering with it and he used to get the really severe pustular papillopustular kind where he would get acne breakouts all over his nose and lucky for me I inherited it so this is something I personally have struggled with I see a lot of patience with it and so I feel like I can really give you a good idea of how I managed to finally get my rosacea under control and also give you a couple tips on what I as a dermatologist can prescribe to use as part of your skincare routine along with some recommendations for skin care products that you can get over the counter so a lot to unpack here and I know I'm a day late I was meeting to film this for April which is rosacea awareness month but you know it's May better late than never so here we go so first things first what the heck is rosacea so rosacea is a very common skincare condition in fact over 14 million Americans have rosacea it's more common in people between the ages of 30 to 50 and more common in Fair or light-skinned individuals now that's not to say that younger people can't get it or people have darker skin tones can't get it they can but this is the demographic that most typically gets rosacea now the cause of it is a little bit more uncertain we definitely know that it is genetic as I already shared my dad has rosacea I have rosacea hopefully my son does not have rosacea but I guess we'll see secondly we know that there is a strong environmental component to it we know there are certain things in your environment that really trigger and flare your rosacea people might have different triggers and this is something I always talk to my patients about you want to figure out what is your trigger and try to minimize exposure to that so the common triggers are alcohol caffeine stress strong emotions whether that's extreme anger or extreme happiness sunlight exposure extreme heat spicy food and hot foods now I just listed a whole bunch of things some of those might trigger your rosacea and some of those might not for me personally I have like a double whammy with alcohol I have Asian glow and I have rosacea so it's like my face lights up like a I don't know like a Christmas tree I also get triggered by exercise and by hot weather I get really really really flushed so those are my triggers now people are always saying if I have rosacea doesn't mean I can't enjoy any of these things that I like like coffee tea alcohol no I'm not saying that I never say that I'm just saying enjoy in moderation and if you happen to be having a rosacea flare maybe cut down on those triggers we also think that the immune system may have something to do with rosacea meaning people with rosacea tend to have a more active immune system where they mount an immune response and get inflammation to little things like the triggers we talked about but also to something else called the Demodex Mite now the Demodex Mite is something harmless it lives on all of our skin loves to live on around our nose and our cheek area which is where rosacea tends to flare but rosacea patients tend to get more of an active immune response to Demodex mites so that's why in some of the treatments I'll talk about later some of those ingredients are actually targeted anti-mite treatment I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here so what exactly does rosacea look like there's four main types of rosacea each of these four types look slightly different and may need different types of treatments first up we have erythematodectatic rosacea that is a mouthful I had to practice that a few times this type is characterized by what you think of as classic rosacea you got the flushing of the cheeks bright red cheeks nose area chin area and you can also get those very visible red squiggly blood vessels next is papillopustular rosacea and this is sometimes misdiagnosed as acne because it can look quite similar this can look like pus filled bumps like whiteheads pustules but it can also look like cysts the kind that you get on your chin around your period like hormonal acne these can appear anywhere on your cheeks your nose your chin people can even break out on other parts of their body too and it is usually accompanied by redness as well the third type is called thymitus rosacea and this one you may not have heard of but you'll probably recognize if you see it this type of rosacea affects the nose and it results in a thickened kind of bumpy and lumpy appearance of the nose over time the nose actually changes shape it looks more bulbous and it basically gets reshaped by this chronic inflammation and chronic untreated rosacea lastly number four there is ocular rosacea which comes along with people who have other types of rosacea and it manifests this kind of dry gritty itchy sensitive eyes your eyes can feel dry they can just feel irritated a lot of my patients will tell me it's like I have sand in my eye or something in my eye particle or something I just want to rub it and it's very itchy that one is also something that we can treat and one that I often refer to my Optometry or Ophthalmology colleagues now the type of rosacea that you have definitely will influence the type of treatment for example if you have just the redness and the visible veins then that can be treated topically or with laser if you have a lot of breakouts like in papillopustular rosacea you might need a short course of oral antibiotics something like doxycycline if you have thymus rosacea and if it's severe if you already have complete change of the architecture of your nose and the anatomy the physiologic appearance of your nose then you might need like laser resurfacing or something to reshape the appearance of your nose and lastly if you have ocular rosacea then your optometrist or your ophthalmologist may actually prescribe you some steroid eye drops so the cause really influences the treatment so it's important to know which type you have one other treatment we have at our disposal for rosacea that's actually really effective are light and Laser therapies there's two recommendations that I have there's intense pulsed light and then there's a vascular laser like a pulse Dye Laser so intense pulse light is actually not a laser because it's not a single wavelength it is a spectrum of wavelengths because it's a it's a light intense pulsed light and what it's good for is for people with some light brown spots and some red spots so it's more surface level it can hit different colors and correct different colors and different types of imperfections but it's not going to be as powerful so I have had IPL done on me twice and the downtime is really minimal I had some little coffee ground specks on my face for maybe three days and then after that it peeled off and it looked fine I did not appreciate a huge Improvement in my redness so I will say that but I think it is effective especially if you have repeat treatments and it can help with brown spots and red spots at the same time the other laser that is really great for rosacea that I have done to tons of patients and have also done on myself many times is the pulse Dye Laser so the pulse dye laser is our preferred laser for vascular lesions including rosacea this is a 595 nanometer wavelength laser and it basically will Target just red colors so this is what I use for red stretch marks red spots and rosacea and it's really good at addressing those juicy plump veins that can become very dilated and noticeable in rosacea patients it usually takes a few sessions I usually say you'll have to do depending on the amount of redness you have anywhere between three to six sessions usually not covered by insurance and the downtime is not bad I mean you will look pretty black and blue you'll look a little bruised for the first day or two so that's why I have my patients usually do it on Friday so you have the weekend to recover so you will be a little black and bruised but the more black and Bruise you are that means the more powerful of a treatment it was and the more effective it's going to be alright so we're going to go into the next part of this video which is going over an AM routine for rosacea and a PM routine for rosace shots let's just dive right into the am routine the most important part of this routine is going to be the sun protection because like I mentioned rosacea flares when you are exposed to UV radiation when you're exposed to the Sun and I always tell my patients the more rosacea flares the more you flush the more dilated those vessels become and the more likely that these changes are not just going to be temporary they're marching towards becoming permanent so it is really important to treat these rosacea symptoms early on and get it under control before the symptoms start to become more permanent so in the morning I typically do an optional cleanse you can cleanse if you want to but you don't have to I like to recommend a sulfur-based cleanser for my patients with rosacea I'll put a couple of recommendations in the caption below or I usually will prescribe to my patients a sulfur-based cleanser and this is usually covered by insurance after the sulfur-based cleanser I will usually have my patients use some type of prescription I am big on custom compounding I like to create prescriptions for my patients tailored very much and personalized for their needs so for rosacea I like to create a blend of azelic acid at percentages higher than what you can get over the counter metronidazole which is an antimicrobial agent and Ivermectin which is an anti-mite agent which is actually really to Target the Demodex mites on your face in these preparations I have also asked pharmacists to sometimes add in a little bit of oxymetazolone or bromonidine these are both Alpha adrenergic receptor agonists meaning they help to clamp down or vasoconstrict we know that in rosacea you have a problem with persistent vessel dilation leading to that flushing and really visible vessels on the skin and so what these agonists do is they will help clamp down those blood vessels which then reduces flushing however in both of these I have found that the effects tend to be temporary they work well but it's temporary and a small percentage of people can experience rebound flushing after taking the medication so they're not really my favorite I tend to rely more on the combination that I listed before which is the metronidazole the Ivermectin and the azelic acid so after applying the medication then I usually will have my patients apply some sort of antioxidant this one is my antioxidant of choice it is the skin better Alto Advanced defense and Repair Serum I've talked about this one a whole lot but it has tetrahexal desol ascorbate vitamin C which is very stable it comes in this Airless pump so you just pump it out when you want to use it so you're not exposing the whole bottle to Air and light and different temperatures each time it keeps really well and it also has this really unique blend of antioxidants I think 17 antioxidants as well as this new aloe pqq technology so this is just one of my favorites and I will link this below it's also really great for sensitive skin and a lot of individuals with rosacea do have sensitive skin and I fall into that category as well and I found that the THD ascorbate based vitamin C's are less irritating than the l-ascorbic acid ones so I like recommending this for all my sensitive skins or rosacea patients next is an extremely important step probably one of the most important steps in your whole routine if you have rosacea and that's your sunscreen step because we know that UV worsens rosacea without a doubt it flares it and the more it flares the worse it gets so I'm going to go over three options with you today now I do like to recommend mineral sunscreens for rosacea patients because of that slightly increased risk for sensitivity with chemical sunscreen ingredients now if you've been following me for a while or if you've heard me talk about sunscreens before you'll know I love my chemical sunscreens but I'm saying for rosacea skinned or sensitive skinned patients the mineral ones might be a slightly better option so I'm going to go over three the first one is actually a color correcting treatment so I've talked about this one before this is the Dr jart sick a pear tiger grass color correcting treatment I like this one as kind of like a moisturizer SPF but I would use SPF on its own before this as well because I just don't think you'd be using enough of this to get the full SPF benefit it is quite thick it comes as a zinc oxide 5.7 titanium dioxide 4.7 percent and I'm going to show you what it looks like today because I didn't show you last time and I regretted it so it comes with this little spatula which you should always use because you don't want to be sticking your Dirty Fingers in there and you should always keep this little cap too because it just helps to prevent more things from going inside it's green it is green green and the centella or the sikka pair is actually an anti-inflammatory agent that we see a lot in Asian beauty so I'm just going to take a little bit of this here and show you how this looks on my hand here as you rub it in it becomes more beige colored a little bit goes a long way and it actually it can take a while to rub in so there you see it rubs in looks really great it definitely gives it a little bit of coverage if you compare my hands you could see that this side looks a little bit more yellowish I guess more beigish because it's been covered and this side is my natural color so you can see one side the redness is gone okay the next sunscreen is the color science Unforgettable Total Protection face shield Flex I've been a fan of color science ever since I was a resident it's just such an elegant beautiful formula the flex is a really cool option where the sunscreen comes out a little bit grayish but as you rub it releases these kind of color correcting pigments then will match to your skin tone so it's really cool this is one of my mom's favorite sunscreens that I've ever gifted her it comes out really creamy it's hydrating it's smooth and beautiful I just really love it and it's 100 mineral the third one is a classic that I've talked about often this is the elta MD it's actually not the UV elements that I'm recommending for rosacea but this is just the one that I have up here the one I recommend for rosacea and acne is the Ulta MD UV clear because it contains niacinamide it also contains tocopherol which is vitamin E and it has some sodium hyaluronate as well which helps to hydrate now in this formulation it's mostly zinc ox side with a little touch of octanoxate so I know I mentioned you know I like my mineral sunscreens for my rosacea and sensitive skinned individuals however this one I have not had an issue with my patients have not had an issue with so if you want a purely mineral sunscreen you can try the color science one but if you are open to this Alta one it has a slight bit of octanoxate but it works really really well too I have not seen any issues with breakouts or sensitivities from it and it just has a very very wonderful finish like when I put on the Elta MD it has enough tint and coverage that I no longer need to wear Foundation it's able to kind of cover up and gloss over all my blemishes and my freckles and it is very hydrating so it's a really wonderful lightweight breathable sunscreen that I just really love then after you do your sunscreen you can do your makeup and be on your Merry way and don't forget to reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're sitting indoors but next to a big window like I am all the time then you do also need to reapply let's hop into the PM skincare routine team I usually will recommend starting off with a gentle cleanser so you do your sulfur cleanser in the morning and then you use a gentle cleanser in the evening this is my favorite gentle cleanser for sensitive skin rosacea skinned individuals this is the La Roche Posay tellurian hydrating gentle cleanser this also contains ceramides and niacinamide niacinamide antioxidant ceramides is kind of like the mortar to your skin cells which are the bricks it's like the glue holding your skin cells together this is very hydrating and honestly just really really gentle I find it very non-irritating and it does a good job of removing dirt oil impurities I will say though if I am wearing a lot of makeup that day I'll start with an oil-based cleanser first I find that this by itself does not quite do the job in getting off all the foundation and the mascara after the cleanser then I would go ahead and put on usually a prescription strength product so either that special compounding medicine that I give to my rosacea patients or using a tretinoin the tretinoin that I recommend hands down Universal for all my rosacea patients is the skin better Alpha red and that's because it's gentle enough for my rosacea patients a lot of my patients with rosacea and myself included cannot tolerate tretinoin prescription strength tretinoin and believe me I have tried like when I was in New York when I was a resident I was like I need to get on track I'm telling all my patients to do it I gotta do it too I suffered through two plus months of looking like a lizard or like a snake that was shedding its skin off and even my patients and co-residents would ask me what is wrong with your skin it was really embarrassing to say the least it caused me a lot of burning irritation and the most I could ever get to use it was like one night a week so when I found the skin better Alpha red which is a retinoid that's conjugated with the lactic acid and it also has glycolic acid in it I was overjoyed because it is the only retinoid I've ever found that gives me zero irritation all my patients who have sensitive skin try this one at my recommendation and they love it so that's the one I would recommend if you find though that you cannot tolerate retinoid if you want to try your retinol product if you want to try your bakuccio product if you want to use your exfoliating peel pads go for it this step is where I would put the retinoid or retinol or your peel pads and I just want to stress again do not over exfoliate your skin especially if you have rosacea or sensitive skin you only want to be doing one exfoliant per night so I would not be trying to put acids and retinoid in all these exfoliating agents in your routine at the same time lastly you have your moisturizing step I'm not really picky on moisturizers for rosacea prone skin I think it's great just to choose a moisturizer that's non-irritating one that won't clog your pores especially if you have the papillopustular rosacea type and one that you like some of my favorite moisturizers for rosacea patients are the Neutrogena Hydro Boost the Sarah vpm facial lotion and personally I've been really enjoying using the Dr jart overnight cream as well as the tatcha Indigo Repair Cream or the Tacho watery cream so I hope you've enjoyed this video it was kind of a big

        "transcript": "if you've got red skin and you're blushing very easily you might have rosacea this video I'll help you understand what rosacea is what causes it how it can be treated and where you can find more information about it so first of all what is rosacea well it's a common skin condition that mainly affects the face it usually appears in fair skin people but it can show up in any skin type now it can start at any age but it's most common in young adults whilst it's more common in women it tends to be more severe in men now racea is a long-term condition that can vary from mild to severe and typically it affects the cheeks the forehead the chin and the nose sometimes it can even affect the neck and the chest now rosacea shows up as persistent redness small bumps and pus filled spots that look like acne it can also cause redness and irritation in the eyes and eyelids now the exact cause of rosacea isn't fully understood it seems to be related to genetics immune system issues and environmental factors triggers like alcohol exercise extreme temperatures hot drinks spicy foods and stress can make it worse and people with rosacea are often more sensitive to the sun now rosacea can run in families but there's no clear genetic links so in terms of the symptoms of rosacea well it can cause a rash and blushing that might make you feel embarrassed can lower your self-esteem and it can even lead to anxiety or depression now the affected skin can feel very hot or sting some people with rosacea may also have eye problem problems like inflammation of the front part of the eye which can cause blurred vision if you've got symptoms affecting your eyes it's important to see a dermatologist or an optician now in terms of what it looks like it often starts with a tendency to blush easily over time the central areas of the face can turn a Deeper Shade of red with small dilated blood vessels bumps and pus filled spots in some cases the facial skin can swell especially around the eyes men might experience an overgrowth of the oil secreting glands on the nose causing it to become enlarged and red a condition that's called ryer now how is it diagnosed well usually it's diagnosed based on its appearance you don't typically need any specific tests and once there's no cure for rosacea longterm treatments can help manage it so in terms of treatments there are several ways to manage and treat rosacea starting off with topical treatments now you can apply medications to the affected areas to control inflammation it might take at least least 8 weeks to see the full effects however now some treatments specifically Target the redness Associated rosacea on the other hand there are oral antibiotics for moderate to severe Rosacea antibiotics can help with inflammation common antibiotics include tetracycline doxcycline and aryin your doctor might also suggest using the cream and the oral antibiotic together at the same time in terms of other treatments well for eye problems an eye specialists can help manage severe eye issues that are related to this in terms of the nose issues a dermatologist or plastic surgeon can reduce the enlarged nose in terms of redness and blood vessels laser therapy can help treat redness and dilated blood vessels and for blushing beta blockers or clonidine might be prescribed in severe cases isotretinoin tablets are sometimes used now there are some things you can do at home as well to help manage your Rosia and we'll cover this briefly now so i' encourage you to use a sunblock with an SPF of at least 30 every day I'd encourage you to gently cleanse your skin so avoid rubbing or scrubbing your face very hard and then use a gentle soap substitute try to use a non-perfumed moisturizer if your skin is dry or sensitive and try keep a diary of what worsens your rosacea and try to avoid those triggers you can also use makeup to cover rosacea and skin camouflage can help hide excessive redness finally it's worth avoiding using acne treatments and cortico steroid creams unless these are specifically been recommended by your health provider now the final thing to mention is that some medicines can worsen blushing your doctor might adjust your medication accordingly if this is the case now for more detailed information and additional resources please check out the links in the description box of the video and as ever thanks for watching until next time bye",
